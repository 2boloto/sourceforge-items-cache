You do not need to know Perl to enjoy it, so why not give it a shot. It's already on all Unix-Based Computers, and for Windows you can get it in a few minutes! Ultra Perl Scripts is not an application, but an online database of perl scripts you can download and execute quickly. None of our perl scripts contain viruses, and you can easily edit them and put them to your own taste! All of our scripts are targeted at UNIX OPERATING SYSTEMS, so Windows users may encounter some problems. Consult us in the discussion area and we'll show you how to make it Windows-friendly. If you're unfamiliar with executing and dowloading perl scripts, go to our wiki and we'll help you. We reccommend ActiveState Perl for Windows users, just google it. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n--\r\nDonovan ", "shortname": "upsproj", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Perl Scripts That Will Blow Your Mind", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 812034}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/upsproj/", "video_url": ""}
