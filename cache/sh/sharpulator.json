It will simulate hardware functionality at a low level without sacrificing performance.  The end goal for this project is to allow the ability to simulate hardware by simply dropping common components onto a virtual integrated circuit.", "shortname": "sharpulator", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A multithreaded, test-driven electronics emulator for .net 4.0.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1087834}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sharpulator/", "video_url": ""}
