You are to kill corrupted High Nobles and Kings that steal money from the people for their own good. Find your way into their hideout (castles and such) without creating commotion to assassinate your target. If you are seen by the guards, they will try and raise the alarm. As soon as alarm has been sound, the mission will restart.
