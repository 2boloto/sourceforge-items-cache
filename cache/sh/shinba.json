It was created with the intent to both update code to be current with web standards as well as maximizing user authority and power. One main difference in Shinba that sets it apart from any other imageboard software is that it, by default, allows the users to create their own \"boards\" (known as macrothreads) which expire after a certain amount of time spent inactive. The users must administrate their boards respectively: bring on mods; ban users; delete spam; etc, etc. Of course, it is possible to unset this feature and simply make the boards static like standard imageboards.", "shortname": "shinba", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Modern imageboard package dedicated to the users", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1916110}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/shinba/", "video_url": ""}
