The VPT project's vision is to make remote access to network-enabled services simpler and safer for end-users.\r\n\r\nUnlike VPNs, VPT does not provide network-level access between participating devices.  As a result VPT users are not vulnerable to firewall misconfigurations and do not have to deal with complex firewall rules for security. Moreover, any potential compromises in a participating system has much lesser impact on other systems since the network perimeter is not extended to include all the participating devices. \r\n\r\nVPT internally works using a novel secure multi-hop port-forwarding technique by setting up virtual on-demand end-to-end tunnels carrying transport-layer data (VPN tunnels carry network-layer data).
