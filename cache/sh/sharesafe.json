But the question still goes unanswered: What good is it? The answer: not much until the consumer gets involved. The truth is that the individual is not in control of his/her health information. One way for people to get control is to start a personal health record (PHR). But this means YOU are responsible for getting your health information into your PHR. It's a lot of work and after you do it, your provider may not accept it. So the answer is to bootstrap your PHR with the information found in the provider's system(s). But to get the provider to do it, something has to be in it for them. So Sharesafe is that bridge. The doctor can benefit from viewing patient data as part of the workflow, and then share the data with the patient from the same place. Then patients can view and forward the shared data from the hospital to his/her personal health record. Now the patient is in control of data that providers will accept and use.", "shortname": "sharesafe", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Sharesafe gets your data out of the hospital and into a PHR", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1289214}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sharesafe/", "video_url": ""}
