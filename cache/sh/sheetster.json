It can import and export the XLS and XLSX file formats and nearly the full range of Excel formula functions are supported. Most basic features are implemented as well as some of the more advanced ones. The user interface is written entirely in JavaScript and its server-side API is pure Java based on the OpenXLS spreadsheet engine. Neither the client nor the server needs Excel or any browser plugins.\r\n\r\nSheetster is primarily intended for developers who want to integrate spreadsheets into their web applications. Towards that end it provides a server-side API for document storage connectors and a rich REST API for manipulating open spreadsheets. It can also be deployed stand-alone by a website administrator to provide spreadsheet editing with a rudimentary CMS.", "shortname": "sheetster", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "an embeddable spreadsheet for your web application", "tools": [{"label": "CVS", "mount_point": "cvs", "name": "cvs"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 230452}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "link"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Issues", "mount_point": "issues", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sheetster/", "video_url": ""}
