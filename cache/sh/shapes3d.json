It not only provides a number of 3D shapes but enables simple creation of a 3D terrain and user controllable camera that can traverse over the terrain. Movement on the terrain can be clamped to prevent moving off the edges or wrapped so that as you move off the terrain your position is wrapped to the other side. The terrain class has a method to create a height map based on perlin noise that is seamless, this gives the impression of travelling over an infinite world.\r\n\r\nAs of version 2.0.0 the library provides a method to enable shape selection and thus user interaction. It uses an off-screen buffer to perform a colour picking algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe library only uses available Processing methods to access the OpenGL commands so should be compatible with future releases of Processing.", "shortname": "shapes3d", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Create 3D shapes for Processing", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2000161}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/shapes3d/", "video_url": ""}
