For this, they need to transport things through cargo services. Many shopping sites also require cargo shipping for transporting goods and products to their customers. The cargo ships are majorly used for such type of services. They are a great way to store goods, ship them to other places and provide transportation for bulk orders. Shipping containers are available in different sizes and make, which depends on your requirement. If you are looking to work in the cargo shipping business, then you will need to buy a cargo ship for providing your services.\r\nThese ships are not like your daily commuting vehicle that can be bought and sold. They are relatively expensive and require docks for parking them. Hence, you need to be fully prepared before embarking on this business.", "shortname": "shiplocator", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Are You Looking For Cargo Ships For Sale?", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 804000}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/shiplocator/", "video_url": ""}
