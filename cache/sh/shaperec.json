Finally the shape recognition is launched.\r\n\r\nAll the algorithms are done for real time gaming. So they are heuristics and do not give the optimal solution. Yet the given solution is generally a good one.\r\n\r\nIn this demonstration, few shapes can be recognized:\r\n* circles\r\n* triangles\r\n* lines (vertical, horizontal and diagonal)\r\n* arcs with horizontal symmetry\r\n* lowercase phi letters\r\n\r\nThe code offers the possibility to add its own shapes or even letters recognition. It will be improved to trigger a specific action by shape.\r\n\r\nThe source code will be available in few days.", "shortname": "shaperec", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Shape recognition for video games using fast algorithms (heuristics).", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1207914}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/shaperec/", "video_url": ""}
