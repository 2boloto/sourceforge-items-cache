As a practical joke on a programmer, if you remotely activate this on your favorite developer's system (I will create a distribution program later), on a system the developer 'thinks' they own and control it will drive them insane when their system will slow to an absolute crawl based on intervals you've set. I find renaming the process to something ultra non intuitive such as 'lcass' and 'mlasst' - to make them 'seem' like system processes - to be among the most effective names - nothign malicious, right, just having fun.\r\n\r\nNow if you're targeting a superstitious developer. I personally find it particularly effective making comments like 'Boy, I wonder if you have a ghost in your system'.\r\n\r\nOh the FUN one can have with this....", "shortname": "qzanticsslugforwindows", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "QZAntics Slug For Windows is a program which slows down all processes", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2361960}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/qzanticsslugforwindows/", "video_url": null}
