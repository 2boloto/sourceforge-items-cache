The HAWK-800 is a hardware/software upgrade kit for the Korg Poly-800 line of synthesizers. The HAWK-800 can be installed in the original Korg Poly-800 as well as the MK2 and the EX-800 synth module.\r\n\r\nThe HAWK-800 software provides a dramatically improved and expanded MIDI implementation as well as many new sound and user control features. The HAWK-800 also allows total control over three of the most common hardware modifications; the \"Moog Slayer\", the \"FM-800\" and the 12/24db filter slope mod's.\r\n\r\nThe sourceforge HAWK-800 project is where I am slowly making all of the rewritten assembler available along with all of the documentation, owner manuals, patches etc. The hope is that the HAWK-800 may be further developed by a team of passionate and dedicated Poly owners other than myself.\r\n\r\nThe HAWK-800 sourcforge project is also going to be the place where all bugs will be tracked, help pages written and feature requests lodged.\r", "shortname": "hawk800", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 342353}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Feature Requests", "mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/hawk800/", "video_url": ""}
