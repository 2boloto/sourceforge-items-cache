The HAWK-800 is a hardware/software upgrade kit for the Korg Poly-800 line of synthesizers. The HAWK-800 can be installed in the original Korg Poly-800 as well as the MK2 and the EX-800 synth module.\r\n\r\nThe HAWK-800 software provides a dramatically improved and expanded MIDI implementation as well as many new sound and user control features. The HAWK-800 also allows total control over three of the most common hardware modifications; the \"Moog Slayer\", the \"FM-800\" and the 12/24db filter slope mod's.\r\n\r\nThe sourceforge HAWK-800 project is where I am slowly making all of the rewritten assembler available along with all of the documentation, owner manuals, patches etc. The hope is that the HAWK-800 may be further developed by a team of passionate and dedicated Poly owners other than myself.\r\n\r\nThe HAWK-800 sourcforge project is also going to be the place where all bugs will be tracked, help pages written and feature requests lodged.\r", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hawk800", "_id": "50f6ba8534309d45cfc956f5", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 342353, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets", "label": "Feature Requests"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
