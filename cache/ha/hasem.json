HASEM solves any linear equation of any kind, it might be homogenous/none homogenous, compute the inverse of square/none square matrices, find LU decomposition, find determinant and rank of matrices, calculate the characteristic polynomial of matrices, find the eigenvalues and eigen vectors and so on. HASEM uses many methods, therefore, you are not limited to just one method, you have the choice to define your desire method as default one. With over 200 member functions and over 40 none member functions HASEM is almost able to solve any linear algebra problems. HASEM support multidimensional as well, you can mix up your multidimensional matrix with other matrices with different size, and apply all operations on them as well.It's possible to save the computed matrix into files, and when required read it from files and load the data into matrices. It is also very easy to add your extension to  HASEM.", "shortname": "hasem", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Matrix c++ library solving any linear algebra problems", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 687652}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/hasem/", "video_url": ""}
