It would not show me how much bandwidth I have used in my current cycle, instead, it would show me how much I have used in this month.\r\n\r\nTired of asking them to rectify the same, I built a tool of my own.\r\n\r\nIt is a little crude, but gets the job done. Was built using the HtmlAgilityPack and is my first real project.\r\n\r\nIt will show you how much high speed usage you have left. It needs only your username and the cycle start date.\r\n\r\nI am planning to incorporate auto detecting of plan and high speed data usage in future versions. I might need some help though. :)", "shortname": "hathwayusagecalculator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Finds bandwidth consumed in current cycle on your Hathway connection", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2463162}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/hathwayusagecalculator/", "video_url": null}
