However, when the scientist Kepler discovered special principles about planetary motion, he also reconsidered the music.  Apparently his observance of a harmonic law of planetary motion was reason for him to propose a computable system of pitch and harmony deriving from angular velocity.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the programming project is as a tool to examine his system.  With Java 2, it provides an open-source solution for listening to harmonies so generated by planetary motion.  This program can run on any computer provided with a Java Virtual Machine (Rev 1.5 or greater).\r\n\r\nJAVA 2, system independent.  Purpose:to encourage research in harmony in astronomy, math and music.
