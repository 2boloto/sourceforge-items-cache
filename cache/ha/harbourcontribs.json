This way it will be possible easily to shift any library/application from here to Harbour or vice-verse.\r\n\r\nAs I am totally ignorant of Harbour's build system, it will be appreciated if someone knowledgeable take over this responsibility, which might be one-time task. \r\n\r\nDevelopers are encouraged to contribute to this project. Just pass on your SourceForge ID. But by doing so please take note that Harbour coding style must always be respected.\r\n\r\nWelcome to new chapter in Harbour history!\r\n\r\nPritpal Bedi\r\na student of software analysis & concepts", "moved_to_url": "QtContribs", "shortname": "harbourcontribs", "_id": "5060c2ab0594ca0ffb2675fc", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 976558, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "New home to HbQt, HbXBP and HbIDE, once Harbour SVN hosted contribs.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: User Interfaces", "shortname": "softwaredev_ui", "fullname": "User Interfaces", "id": 561}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Agile development tools", "shortname": "agile", "fullname": "Agile development tools", "id": 764}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: XBase/Clipper", "shortname": "xbaseclipper", "fullname": "XBase/Clipper", "id": 706}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "fullname": "SQL-based", "id": 508}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: xBase", "shortname": "db_file_xbase", "fullname": "xBase", "id": 519}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "fullname": "Qt", "id": 479}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
