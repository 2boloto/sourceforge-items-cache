It provides a number of functionalities ranging from String manipulation to TextFile I/O, XML parsing and much more. It is fully customizable in the sense that it is comprised of many different modules and the user can choose which parts of the library he requires for this programs. Refu currently requires a C99 compliant compiler to correctly compile but that might change in the future. In addition as C11 gains more support it will move to utilize the new C11 features such as anonymous structures and other very useful additions for compilers that support it. \r\n\r\n**NOTICE**: Please clone the Git repository instead of downloading the .zip of the project since the  .zip is updated very rarely \r\n\r\nFor full documentation visit: http://clib.refu.co", "shortname": "refu", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@LefterisJP", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Refu is a collection of cross-platform C/C++ programming libraries", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 838491}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/refu/", "video_url": ""}
