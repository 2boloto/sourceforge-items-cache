The algorithm is a multi-variable regressor (one to many) trained using an input expression matrix to learn the relationships (correlations) among a target gene and all the other genes. The overall network is obtained by joining all the neighborhoods. RegnANN makes no assumptions about the nature of the relationships between the variables, potentially capturing high-order and non linear dependencies between expression patterns.\r\n\r\nTo compile the software you are required to install CUDA SDK for your platform. We provide a reference Makefile that should be good enough for standard installations (unix/32bits).\r\n\r\nSee README file for further information\r\n\r\nThe software is part of research work published online.
