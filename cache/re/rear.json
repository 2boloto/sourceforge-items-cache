As a benefit, it allows to  restore to different hardware and can therefore be used as a migration tool as well.\r\n \r\nCurrently Relax-and-Recover supports various boot media (incl. ISO, PXE, OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of network protocols (incl. sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) as well as a multitude of backup strategies (incl.  IBM TSM, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker, Bacula, rsync).\r\n \r\nRelax-and-Recover was designed to be easy to set up, requires no maintenance and is there to assist when disaster strikes.
