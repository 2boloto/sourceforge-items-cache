With a strong focus on hydraulic, coastal, offshore and environmental engineering, as well as Marine CFD, the use of the level-set method enables it to calculate complex free surface flows. The model is implemented in highly modular C++ and the source code is available under the GPL license. The MPI library is used for parallelization, making REEF3D the perfect tool for high performance CFD calculations. The model is currently under development and additional features are added in a fast pace. The goal is to make the full transition from a research tool to a powerful engineering software.", "shortname": "reef3d", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Open Source CFD", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 360587}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/reef3d/", "video_url": null}
