The first mechanism analyzes a set of reputation values provided by the evaluator to its partners and estimates the behavioral pattern being followed by such agent when providing the reputation values. Then, the second mechanism, based on the identified behavioral pattern, estimates the reputation value the agent will receive and the certainty degree of such value that is calculated based on the difference among the reputation values.
