But never does it happen that we consider the users browsing behavior while targeting an advertisement. By behavior we mean, speculating exactly what user is looking for.  Moreover the revenue that the online advertisement industry generates is never shared with the carriers of this information which are the Internet Service Providers. The Internet Service providers just become\u2019s the carriers of information and does nothing with the vast amount of information flowing through its lines. The revenue goes to the advertisement publishers i.e. the Websites and the advertising agencies with the ISP having no share of it.The current scenario for targeting an advertisement follows a page based model which a contextual ads scheme.
