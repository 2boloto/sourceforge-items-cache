Its name, ROS-Enhanced Scalable Haptic Library, describes all its main features:\r\n- ROS-Enhanced: the library can be used as a library in the ROS framework (Robot Operating System - http://www.ros.org/) and provides out-of-the-box support for master-slave solutions\r\n- Scalable: the library consists in different sub-libraries with different software dependencies. This way you don't have to install software for devices or functionality you're not going to use. Refer to Structure section for details on the single sub-libraries.\r\n- Haptic: the end-application is using pen-master devices to simulate the sense of touch in a haptic virtual environment.\r\n- Library: the software is distributed in c++ libraries with an easy interface. A graphic environment based on OpenGL is generated to improve the user's experience.", "shortname": "reshl", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "ROS-Enhanced Scalable Haptic Library", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2468330}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/reshl/", "video_url": null}
