One of the more unique aspects of the game is that ship power management is not as simple as filling a cube with power generation blocks. This mechanism leads to difficulties in getting maximal power generation out of such reactors.\r\n\r\nThis program rectifies this issue by using a self-organizing variant of brute force search. Much of the search space is pruned early on by a user-selectable fitness function. Within a few epochs, reactor output quickly converges to several sub-optimal, yet high-output reactors. Given enough time, the idea is that the optimal reactor configuration will be yielded.", "shortname": "reactorbreeder", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Genetic Algorithm for Reactors in StarMade", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1892677}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/reactorbreeder/", "video_url": ""}
