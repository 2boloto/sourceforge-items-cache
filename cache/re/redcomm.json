It simplifies communication over the serial port by providing methods and interfaces, which can be used to read and write to the serial port or over an emulated serial cable by using bluetooth. The major focus is on the ease of use of the library. Besides that the experienced user has the ability to change the reading and writing behaviour of the library. This means the user can easily extend and customize the RedComm library. Internally RedComm uses part of the RxTx Library (http://rxtx.qbang.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) for port communication. Thus RedComm helps the unexperienced user using RxTx. RxTx is licensed under the LGPL 2.1 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html). RedComm also provides facilities for event based serial communication with the help of threading in order to non-block ie. the gui thread of the corresponding application.\r\nRedComm is ideally suited for education e.g at schools.", "shortname": "redcomm", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "RedComm is a Java library simplifying communication with a serial port", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Example Projects", "mount_point": "example", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 645873}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/redcomm/", "video_url": ""}
