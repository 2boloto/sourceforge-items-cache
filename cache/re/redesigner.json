They can often get broken, corrupted, or out-of-sync with the markup, leading to complicated problems that are often difficult to resolve.\r\n\r\nRedesigner is a command-line tool that can read and parse .aspx and .ascx files and generate .designer files for them.  It runs quickly and reliably, and can display lots of useful information about how the .designer file was generated.  It can also validate existing .designer files.  It does not use or require Visual Studio, either!\r\n\r\nRedesigner has an open-source license (the New BSD license) and can be reused anywhere for nearly any purpose, for free!\r\n\r\nSo take the pain out of ASP.NET today and get yourself a copy of Redesigner \u2014 you'll be glad you did!", "shortname": "redesigner", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Redesigner is a tool to generate and validate ASP.NET designer files", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1200272}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/redesigner/", "video_url": ""}
