With RPE the admin is able to view all the running processes on a client and of course kill them. RPE shows also the services and their state and start type, you are able to directly get to the c$ share or open a remote commandshell (winrs) and connect to the client via RDP. But that's not all, RPE will show errors and warnings of the past 30 days out of the application eventlog and the system eventlog. \r\nYou need to know to which groups the actual logged on user on the remote client belongs to? No problem RPE will determine them for you!\r\nAnd the best: It's free and open source!\r\n\r\nPlease be so kind to leave a review about RPE after downloading, this is my only source to improve RPE and to implement your requirements to it!", "shortname": "reproex", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "Seranor2001", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/groups/561620420522319/", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Manage Remote Host Processes", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 767494}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/reproex/", "video_url": ""}
