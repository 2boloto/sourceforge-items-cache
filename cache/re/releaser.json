This project has 2 things.\r\n\r\n1 - Releaser - server\r\n2 - Catcher - client\r\n\r\n1-----\r\nReleaser is the server program. It contains 3 files.\r\n\r\n--settings--\r\nThere is a file named \"settings.ini\". Open it and change the number in there..It calls the port which your pc allow to make connections through that port. \r\n\r\n--msg--\r\nthere is a txt file named \"msg\". edit it and write your own message. whenever someone connect you, the server will send the msg.\r\n\r\n--releaser--\r\nthe server\r\n\r\nPS:- Open the port in your firewall before start the server\r\n\r\n2-----\r\nSimply, this is the client. type the ip and port that server pc's. \"Get it\" button will get the message for you from the server's pc.\r\n\r\nI play games, so I thought that this will helpful to the server owners, so they can send any message to the ones that connects to their server.\r\n\r\nI hope to see your comments about my project as this is my first :) \r\n\r\nThanks", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "releaser", "_id": "541aefe781b24b0e72afaa70", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2326376, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "This is for exclusively for gamers", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
