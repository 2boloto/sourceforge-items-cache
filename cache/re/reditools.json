RNA editing is a post-transcriptional phenomenon involving the insertion/deletion or substitution of specific bases in precise RNA localizations. In human, RNA editing occurs by deamination of cytosine to uridine (C-to-U) or mostly by the adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) conversion through ADAR enzymes. A-to-I substitutions may have profound functional consequences and have been linked to a variety of human diseases including neurological and neurodegenerative disorders or cancer. Next generation sequencing technologies offer the unique opportunity to investigate in depth RNA editing even though no dedicated software has been released up to now. REDItools are simple python scripts conceived to facilitate the investigation of RNA editing at large-scale and devoted to research groups that would to explore such phenomenon in own data.", "shortname": "reditools", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "RNA editing detection by NGS data", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2414443}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/reditools/", "video_url": null}
