At its core is a Python TCP server built on Asynchronous Messaging Protocol and Twisted's AMP module. This means RedMQ can support clients in any language, though only two clients - PHP and Python - have been implemented to date. The API is designed with flexibility in mind, providing native support for conditional messaging and custom message routing as well as standard point-to-point and publish-subscribe messaging models.", "shortname": "redmq", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple, flexible messaging with Redis.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1051984}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/redmq/", "video_url": ""}
