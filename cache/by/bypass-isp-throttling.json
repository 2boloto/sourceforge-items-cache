For those with experience overseas, that should be enough to establish the premise for this project. For those with not, please allow me to continue.. My provider assures its customers with something like .38 meg, but it's more like .04 and that's without VPN! With a VPN, .06, so, you can see i'm in a pinch. No other provider; remote village; SOL. An acquaintence at StrongVPN, my VPN, told me there are at least five ways to bypass ISP throttling, but i lost the transcript of the conversation. i realize it's all about port/encryption utilization, but my learning curve for those areas appears to be slow.. Any positive comments or reactions will be appreciated :)", "summary": "VPN improves by 50% but that's from .04 to .06", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2373562, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "mercurial", "name": "hg", "label": "Mercurial"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bypass-isp-throttling", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/samiamqqq/", "username": "samiamqqq", "name": "Salvatore Micheal"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://bypass-isp-throttling.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "id": 460}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "id": 868}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Design", "fullname": "Design", "shortname": "design", "id": 582}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: Other file transfer protocol", "fullname": "Other file transfer protocol", "shortname": "otherfile", "id": 788}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: SSH (Secure SHell)", "fullname": "SSH (Secure SHell)", "shortname": "ssh", "id": 820}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}]}}
