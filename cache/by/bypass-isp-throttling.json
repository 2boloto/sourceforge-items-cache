For those with experience overseas, that should be enough to establish the premise for this project. For those with not, please allow me to continue.. My provider assures its customers with something like .38 meg, but it's more like .04 and that's without VPN! With a VPN, .06, so, you can see i'm in a pinch. No other provider; remote village; SOL. An acquaintence at StrongVPN, my VPN, told me there are at least five ways to bypass ISP throttling, but i lost the transcript of the conversation. i realize it's all about port/encryption utilization, but my learning curve for those areas appears to be slow..
