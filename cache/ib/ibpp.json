It also works with InterBase\u00ae 6.0, though it is expected it might only support Firebird in the future. It is a class library, free of any specific development tool dependencies. It is not tied to any 'visual' or 'RAD' tool. It was developed to add Firebird access in any C++ application. Those applications using IBPP can be non-visual (CORBA/COM objects, other libraries of classes and functions, procedural 'legacy' code, for instance). But it can of course also be used in visual or RAD environments. IBPP is purely a dynamic SQL interface to Firebird. In some easy to use C++ classes, you will find nearly all what is needed to access a Firebird database, and manipulate the data. IBPP also offers access to most of the administrations tasks: creating a database, modifying its structure, performing online backups, administering user accounts on the server and the like.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ibpp", "_id": "507ebff5bfc09e1ac293dce0", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 9514, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "cvs", "name": "cvs", "label": "Cvs"}, {"mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets", "label": "Feature Requests"}, {"mount_point": "patches", "name": "tickets", "label": "Patches"}, {"mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bugs"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "IBPP is a C++ client class library for FirebirdSQL", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
