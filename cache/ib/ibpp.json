It also works with InterBase\u00ae 6.0, though it is expected it might only support Firebird in the future. It is a class library, free of any specific development tool dependencies. It is not tied to any 'visual' or 'RAD' tool. It was developed to add Firebird access in any C++ application. Those applications using IBPP can be non-visual (CORBA/COM objects, other libraries of classes and functions, procedural 'legacy' code, for instance). But it can of course also be used in visual or RAD environments. IBPP is purely a dynamic SQL interface to Firebird. In some easy to use C++ classes, you will find nearly all what is needed to access a Firebird database, and manipulate the data. IBPP also offers access to most of the administrations tasks: creating a database, modifying its structure, performing online backups, administering user accounts on the server and the like.", "shortname": "ibpp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "IBPP is a C++ client class library for FirebirdSQL", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 9514}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Cvs", "mount_point": "cvs", "name": "cvs"}, {"label": "Feature Requests", "mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Patches", "mount_point": "patches", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ibpp/", "video_url": ""}
