AP3 also have a few foundation classes for data manipulation purpose, such as AAObject root which allows tagging object with selector-keyed arbitrarily typed bytes, or AAChunk, an equal-entry array which allows managing two or more binary streams as a single multi-field stream, or striding one stream into some, and some other partitioning abstractions. AP3 also provides a GUI system for NSOperation management, to provide the concurrency as much as everywhere-possible.", "shortname": "mus3", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Multimedia asset management and manipulator for \u00c9toil\u00e9", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 262554}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "AP3", "mount_point": "ap3", "name": "git"}, {"label": "MUS3", "mount_point": "mus3", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mus3/", "video_url": ""}
