People use social networks to keep in touch, share images and other media content, search friends by interests and so on. One person could have several accounts on different services and different data uploaded to them. Therefore, there is a need of special application for working with user\u2019s accounts from several services at the same time.\r\n\r\nMusson projects group (Musson group) solves these problems by creating a group of integrated services that provide permanent access to the most popular social services from your mobile or desktop platforms. The project idea is to make the work with different social networks easier and provide the integration with some platform key services. Using several applications and plugins user can access to similar functionality of different social networks.\r\n \r\nThe project is supported by grant KA179 of Karelia ENPI programme, http://kareliaenpi.eu/", "shortname": "musson", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Client for social networks", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2174215}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/musson/", "video_url": null}
