One chapter teaches how to write wav music directly from numbers and formulas, without recording equipment. The 'styles' produce music from the algorithm of Kircher (1650) to all styles including the author's own unique fractal music. The algorithms are explained in technical terms of music theory, including the special data structures constructed. Styles range from medieval music to modern and the genre of game music. There are folders of c files for each chapter with code, that may be compiled and when executed, generate the midi files.
