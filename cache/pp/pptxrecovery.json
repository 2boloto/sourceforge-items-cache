This GUI uses a somewhat corruption immune unzipper, 7zip. 7zip sometimes succeeds in extracting the slide xml files that contain the text from corrupt pptx files where PowerPoint 2007 - 2013 fail with their built in unzipper. \r\n\r\nFurthermore Corrupt PPTX Salvager uses regular expressions to extract the text from these slide XML files rather than getting hung up on correct XML structure as PowerPoint seems to do during recovery attempts. \r\n\r\nA recent improvement is adding a zip repair pretreatment using InfoZip's zip.exe -FF command and an alternatives menu with additional ppt and pptx resources.\r\n\r\nCorrupt PPTX Salvager is based on PPTX to Text converter by Sopan Shewale. His project is hosted on Sourceforge. Sopan's project is further based on Sandeep Kumar's docx2txt which is also found here.\r\n\r\nThis program was formerly known as PPTX Recovery and Corrupt PPTX2TXT.", "shortname": "pptxrecovery", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A corruption ignoring unzipper & regular expressions extract PPTX text", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 356053}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pptxrecovery/", "video_url": ""}
