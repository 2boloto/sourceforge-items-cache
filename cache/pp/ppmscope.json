The\r\nintent is that the project can be constructed by an electronics hobbiest using\r\nthe instructions included.  The design is a compromise between features and\r\ncost.  The bandwidth is lower than a commercial scope, so it's use is limited\r\nto signals of 500 kHz and below.  It's sample buffer is also smaller than\r\na commercial scope, however sufficient for most oscilloscope functions.\r\n\r\nThis is a version based on the PIC16F877A microcontroller running with a 20MHz \r\nclock.  The maximum sampling rate is 1 MHz with a 5 Mhz equivalent sampling\r\nmode.  Currently, the computer interface supports USB, serial, and parallel ports.\r\n\r\nGood luck on the construction and I hope you enjoy your oscilloscope.  I am\r\nhappy to answer any questions or provide technical support for this design.\r\n", "shortname": "ppmscope", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Microcontroller based PC Oscilloscope", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 716038}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ppmscope/", "video_url": null}
