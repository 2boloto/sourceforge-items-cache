The privacy of the data sent back and for has become a crucial issue. As a matter of\r\nfact, in one of their most recent publications, Chen et al  analyzed this problem and showed that, although the existence of powerful communication security systems such as HTTPS, WPA/WPA2 Wi-Fi encryption, several high-scaled Webapps are exposed to side-channel attacks using timing and a subset of the applications\u2019 internal information flows. In response to it, Liu et al developed a privacy model, introduced by Chen et al , to prevent this threat. The approach aims to protect the size of the packets exchanged during the\r\ncommunication between the client and the server and makes use of the privacy-preserving traffic padding (PPTP). Our paper proposes a novel economical mechanism to achieve this PPTP on\r\nthe basis of the well-known privacy preserving method called ldiversity.\r\n", "shortname": "pptp-vs-ppdp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 772630}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pptp-vs-ppdp/", "video_url": ""}
