Its goal is to orchestrate the timely execution of the distributed tasks of a distributed real-time system (DRTS) in a flexible way. \r\nThe service has been designed for highly coupled applications that execute over LANs. It provides a synchronous framework to synchronize distributed applications that is open to accept and remove components on-line, with reduced impact on the application timing. It also provides the flexibility to use different distributed scheduling policies that can override the local operating systems schedulers. Lastly, the middleware layer will also focus on data transactions, including a synchronous data communication service.
