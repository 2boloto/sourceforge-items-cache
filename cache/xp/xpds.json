The computational model is based upon the Giotto language developed by the BeAR research group at Berkeley. \r\n\r\nXPDS programs consist of tasks (modularised snippets of functional code), communication channels (similar to drivers in Giotto), and modes (which are sub-designs that share information/data).\r\n\r\nXPDS was developed at the University of Johannesburg as part of a Masters investigation. We've proven it on a number of complete systems - control systems for helicopters, normal and delta fixed-wings, as well as some derivative work like camera control systems and ground station interfaces. \r\n\r\nIf you try it out drop me a line at sam@adcourses.co.za, I'd appreciate the feedback.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xpds", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gearsad/", "username": "gearsad", "name": "Sam Claassens"}], "external_homepage": "http://xpds.sourceforge.net"}
