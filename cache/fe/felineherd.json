For all its power, Lisp has been criticised for giving individuals so much leverage that little social interaction ensues. Projects rarely reach common ground or a perceived standard. Emacs, for all it's power, is a testament to this.\r\n\r\nThere are literally thousands of packages allowing the customisation of Emacs. These are daunting to set up and configure for the novice user. Yet a coherent configuration is instrumental to assisting the novice user with becoming productive. As of Emacs 24, package management is integrated, but yet again there are divergent package manager paradigms (EL-Get & ELPA) and a number of repositories exist for these. They are not pre-configured.\r\n \r\nFeline Herd aims to \"herd the cats\" by bringing package management under one roof and providing a graphical user interface. \r\n\r\nFeline Herd is written in Emacs Lisp.", "shortname": "felineherd", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "2000+ Lisp Plugins For Emacs under one Roof", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1901278}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/felineherd/", "video_url": ""}
