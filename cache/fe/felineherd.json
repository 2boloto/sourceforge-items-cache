For all its power, Lisp has been criticised for giving individuals so much leverage that little social interaction ensues. Projects rarely reach common ground or a perceived standard. Emacs, for all it's power, is a testament to this.\r\n\r\nThere are literally thousands of packages allowing the customisation of Emacs. These are daunting to set up and configure for the novice user. Yet a coherent configuration is instrumental to assisting the novice user with becoming productive. As of Emacs 24, package management is integrated, but yet again there are divergent package manager paradigms (EL-Get & ELPA) and a number of repositories exist for these. They are not pre-configured.\r\n \r\nFeline Herd aims to \"herd the cats\" by bringing package management under one roof and providing a graphical user interface. \r\n\r\nFeline Herd is written in Emacs Lisp.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "felineherd", "_id": "51e8ec2d81b24b695568651c", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1901278, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "2000+ Lisp Plugins For Emacs under one Roof", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
