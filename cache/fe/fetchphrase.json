The application monitors keyboard input across Windows programs as you type. When the application recognizes a shorthand notation, it sends the replacement text to the active Windows program, alleviating the needs to retype often-used words, phrases or sentences.\r\n\r\nFetchPhrase Shorthand is ideal for medical transcriptionists, healthcare providers, lawyers, or others who frequently reuse words and sentences while typing.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: By its very nature, this application monitors global keyboard input.
