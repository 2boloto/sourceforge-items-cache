The bachelor thesis can be found through Chalmers Publication Library. The authors of the project are: Olof Ahl\u00e9n, Gustav Bohlin, Kristoffer Carlsson, Martin Gren, Patric Holmvall and Petter S\u00e4terskog.\r\n\r\nUtilizing the Feynman Path Integral formalism of Quantum Mechanics, models have been derived for different physical systems. Using Monte Carlo techniques with the Metropolis algorithm, ground state energies are calculated for the physical systems. All this is implemented in a neat little program to be run on a Graphical Processing Unit through Python and OpenCL (with PyOpenCL).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "feynmangpu", "_id": "516c512be88f3d0ab973648b", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 547443, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "GPU Implementation of the Feynman Path-Integral Method in Quantum Mec.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
