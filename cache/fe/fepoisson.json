Output is a msh format file with field data to be viewed with gmsh features such as flexible graphics and rich plug-in pos-processing.\r\n\r\nProblem characteristics such as materials, boundaries, symmetry and solving options are described by a simple text file (see screenshot).\r\n", "shortname": "fepoisson", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Finite element 2D/3D nonlinear solver for Poisson equation problems", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2086419}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fepoisson/", "video_url": ""}
