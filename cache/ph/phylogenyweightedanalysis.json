Phylogeny-Weighted Analysis is a robust phylogenetic comparative method (PCM) that gives a weight between 0 and 1 to each species according to its share of evolutionary time in the phylogeny after correcting for evolutionary inertia (since only inertia traits that hardly change over time cause false statistics). This weight represents reduced effective data point numbers and can be robustly used to correct biased statistics. Conventional statistics, such as correlation coefficients, multiple linear regression beta coefficients (standardized), Student's t test and their corresponding p-values can be conveniently and correctly calculated based on such weight.", "shortname": "phylogenyweightedanalysis", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "It corrects effective sample size for phylogenetic data for statistics", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2089996}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/phylogenyweightedanalysis/", "video_url": ""}
