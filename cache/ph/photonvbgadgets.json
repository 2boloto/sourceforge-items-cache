Photon can find roots, minimums and maximums, points of inflection, and it can fit several types of best fit lines and curves to data sets.  Log and semi-log graphing are also available.\r\n     Photon can save data to several file types, including images such as .jpg and .png.  Display options are also available, including a dark / light theme for optimal visibility from a projector.\r\n     Photon's primary goal is to be easy to use while retaining a feature-rich design.
