Aside from a few common modules such as Smarty, this system is written from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe intention is to build a framework that you can add/remove components to quickly without breaking it. The modules for the most part will be self-contained, using a custom loader for any dependancies (similar to the way DLL's depend on other DLL's to be present).\r\n\r\nEach module is designed to run independant of the framework so you can strip it down to just one component.\r\n\r\nThis is not a MVC based framework. It is structured the way you would typically develop a desktop application with classes, and a main controller which, with the user side being dependent on Smarty templates, although you can adapt it to be MVC if you desire by stripping out Smarty and adding in a module to handle your code this way.\r\n\r\nOther Contributers: https://sourceforge.net/users/myrddinwylt", "shortname": "php-self", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple Enhanced Light Framework", "tools": [{"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2181830}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/php-self/", "video_url": null}
