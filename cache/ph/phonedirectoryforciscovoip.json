In one script all numbers are displayed flat, where in the other script its working with submenus.\r\n\r\nThe third script is for MySQL where you can create your own database and store multiple numbers (i.e. mobile,fax,home) for each person.\r\n\r\nInstallation is pretty easy and included in readme. You will need Webserver to get the php script from your phone. The phone needs to be configured to have phonebook entries on the directory button (there is another txt file which explains that). Additionally there is an LDAP and/or MySQL Server needed to fetch the data from.\r\n\r\nThe original php script for phone directory with MySQL integration was started 2003 by Brandon Tatton and Jared Smith. The php script for LDAP servers was provided by Gael Marronnier.
