It is based upon a  strategy called read clustering. Starting with kmer frequency analysis, this allows for a reasonable selection of the kmer sizes. K-tuples from raw reads are merged and sorted into a table so that multiple occurring kmer words shared by different reads can be linked.\u00a0 A relation matrix is used to record the shared kmer words among all the reads. Setting a minimum threshold of shared k-tuples, the whole set of reads can then be clustered into groups using kmer sharing information in the relational matrix. After obtaining small read clusters with a controllable size, a local assembler can be used to produce contigs.", "shortname": "phusion2", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The genome assembly pipeline based on read clustering", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2309276}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/phusion2/", "video_url": null}
