And it is a rare occurence that the provider can (or wants to) estimate all the requirements for your site application. Especially when your site isn't based on one of the widely known CMS. There are many things to be wary of: are all the required modules installed? Do they all have the correct versions? Is the PHP version correct and is there enough memory or not and so on.\r\nThis small and smart script will help you to check all requirements specified in one simple xml-file. Just deploy the script and requirements file to the target system and run it.\r\nYou can easily integrate this script with your own solution.
