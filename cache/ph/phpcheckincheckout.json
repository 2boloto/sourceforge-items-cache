There are patrons coming in and going out with items like laptops for internet browsing. The problem arises when one leaves their laptop in the reading area and someone else walks with it out of the library without being noticed.\r\n\r\nThis software seeks to solve such a problem by having all items and their owners being registered on a database and each time they come to the library/facility, they are checked in. Then when they leave, they are checked out, ensuring that one only leaves with what actually belongs to them as registered on the database.\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions: http://sourceforge.net/p/phpcheckincheckout/wiki/How%20to%20install", "shortname": "phpcheckincheckout", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "PHP-MySQL based software to track checked-in and checked-out items.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1986645}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/phpcheckincheckout/", "video_url": ""}
