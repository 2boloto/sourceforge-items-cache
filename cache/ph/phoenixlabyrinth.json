A battle ensues if you do, of course. Screen shots below depict the battle system. If you lose the battle, you must make camp and lose your next turn, but you gain full health after that. Along the way are Tavern's that you can rest at for the night and make camp, but you lose your next turn just like if you lose a battle. You must land directly on said Tavern's to be able to stay at them though, so you have to make strategic plans on how much health you have and when you want to make camp or risk losing a battle.", "shortname": "phoenixlabyrinth", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Board game style PC Game", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2182578}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/phoenixlabyrinth/", "video_url": null}
