It was designed to help with f2 computation in cases when intra- and inter-batch variability is large, namely RSD>10%. The use of statistical bootstrap technique allows to implement confidence interval (CI) into the f2 coefficients resulting in overcoming of their major drawback in the original metrics. The algorithm provides possible \u201cworst case scenario\u201d of f2 values, thus supporting claim about pharmaceutical equivalence. The target users are researchers from industry and academia dealing with pharmaceutical equivalence problem.\r\nThe software is Open Source.
