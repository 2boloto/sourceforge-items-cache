Its purpose is to report complex projects and reduce code review time. The tool is capable to traverse complex directories structure, find PHP code and generate report. \r\n\r\nThere were comment reporting tools available, but they simply state the percentage of commented and uncommented lines. That is not practically useful for devs and code reviewers. This tool will parse each line of code and check for comments. It will finally generate a report marking each uncomment line of code with complete file path. It will also mark files as red flag which are crossing threshold value. This tool will eliminate blank lines and comments while calculating percentage for accuracy purpose", "shortname": "phpcommentcheck", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Tool will report uncommented lines of code in files/folders", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1208918}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/phpcommentcheck/", "video_url": ""}
