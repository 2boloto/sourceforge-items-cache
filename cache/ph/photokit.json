It will be possible in the future.\r\n\r\nThe UI of PhotoKit is based on Qt graphics framework (except filedialog), so you will have the same experience on all platforms. On N9, it only supports landscape mode because the limitation of QWidget. At the begining, i just use many QWidget based components, but they are very ugly on Harmattan, so I have to wrote these components using graphics framework, e.g. button, textinput and dialog.
