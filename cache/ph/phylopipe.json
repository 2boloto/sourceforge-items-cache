Analysis of the evolutionary biology, one of the main branches of bioinformatics, uses several common software such as HaMStR,MUSCLE, RaxML. Running different procedures successively, we can get the evolutionary analysis eventually. Since the input and output data between different software are not always compatible for each other, the intermediate results need to be processed outside these software, which definitely brings trouble for biologists. Therefore, developing a graphical molecular phylogenetic analysis software is sure to improve the efficiency of evolutionary analysis in a large scale.", "shortname": "phylopipe", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "PhyloPipe is a combination of some polular phylogenetic software", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2369043}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/phylopipe/", "video_url": null}
