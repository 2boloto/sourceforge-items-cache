It\u2019s been made very popular by the big search engines. Yahoo did it first, and now Google has Instant which is killing its competitors. But how do you get one on your site? Luckily, jQuery has given us a very simple solution: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s pretend you are making a website for a client who has multiple locations all throughout the United States. They ask you to build a form which takes a zipcode and spits out locations surrounding that zipcode. They also request, that, as the user types their zipcode, a suggestion box appears showing them relevant matches.\r\n\r\njQuery\u2019s autocomplete makes this an easy task.

Make sure you give your search box an id attribute, as it\u2019s easier to work with that way.", "shortname": "phpjqueryautocomplete", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2371351}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Mercurial", "mount_point": "mercurial", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/phpjqueryautocomplete/", "video_url": null}
