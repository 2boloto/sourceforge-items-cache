RigMechanix will not only output accurate loading values indicating any that are unsafe, but also warn the user of excessive local deformation due to excessive point loads, span lengths that are too large, as well as areas of weakness.\r\n\r\nIt is designed to be used on-the-fly as much as it is in the preparation stage; there is a strong emphasis on speed & RigMechanix will contain an expandable database of fixtures, truss/beam types & rigging points ready for use so that input models can be created, edited and analysed in as little time as possible.\r\n\r\nFor into the future, RigMechanix will suggest design optimisations and a more intuitive GUI. Ultimately it will support 3D structures and collaborate with CAD & FEA software", "shortname": "rigmechanix", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Super quick load analysis for rigged structures.
