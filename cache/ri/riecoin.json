It allows to transfer money to anywhere in the world with only minimum transaction fees, sometimes even for free. It is a fork of the Bitcoin project. The name \"Riecoin\" pays homage to Bernhard Riemann, whose work generated new ways of studying the distribution of prime numbers and is referenced in the math of Riecoin. It also pays homage to Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that started them all.\r\n\r\nrminerd cpuminer is a multi-threaded, highly optimized CPU miner for Riecoin. It still has support for Litecoin, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Currently supported algorithms are RIECOIN style prime sextuplets, SHA-256d and scrypt(1024, 1, 1).\r\nIt supports the getwork mining protocol as well as the Stratum mining protocol, and can be used for both solo and pooled mining.\r\n\r\nNotice: Please see here to understand why this package is recognized as a threat by some antivirus software: https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer/issues/13", "shortname": "riecoin", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@riecoin", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/TheRiecoinCommunity", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "riecoin cryptocurrency", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2081987}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/riecoin/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/Zl-WONrwnVw?rel=0"}
