You can extend or modify the filter in python without needing to recompile the entire plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am releasing this to the community in case other administrators are having\r\n the same frustrating time with their users as I am and need more power to scan incoming mail.", "shortname": "mdspamfilter", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "File scanning spam filter MDaemon plugin.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 757136}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mdspamfilter/", "video_url": ""}
