Another script renames snaps to preserve them as monthlies or annuals and another script purges the remainder of snaps based on a retention policy defined in that severs configuration file, normally 21 nighties, 12 monthly and 7 annuals. It all runs from cronies. It does lots of nice logging and error checking and has nice health check scripts which can be used to integrate this with nagios.  it's reasonably mature and stable, I rewrote if from bash to perl a year ago, but in concept it's been running g for 5 years ago, I started it using solaris express developers edition, zfs v10.
