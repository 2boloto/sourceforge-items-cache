It has some very interesting features unique to Linux/Unix desktops like direct controls for several media players and its ability to bring in full screen virtualy any application. It can flow through the full screened applications and the desktop in a manner similar to the application stack of the Amiga OS, which provides an innovative way to go around the desktop space, without compromising traditional X multiple desktop pages.\r\n\r\nThe core code was written by harnir Maciej Delmanowski with contributions  from many other folks.
