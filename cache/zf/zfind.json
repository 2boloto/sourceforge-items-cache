Worse, that resource is inside a zip which is itself inside ANOTHER zip (i.e. nested archive). \r\n\r\nPossibly you need to verify whether a particular resource is present in an ear or you want to know part of a file name but don't know which zip/jar on your hard disk contains that class file. \r\n\r\nzfind solves this problem. zfind is very fast and it works on most common archive/compress files. Apart from GUI and command line, it also provides API support which let's you use it in your java code as a 3rd party library.\r\n\r\nThanks for using, and if you find any bug, do post a ticket or discussion topic. I can't fix anything if I don't know the problem :)\r\n\r\n**Check Wiki for USAGE details", "shortname": "zfind", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "zfind is a fast file search utility/API for searching within archives", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 776442}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/zfind/", "video_url": ""}
