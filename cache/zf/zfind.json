Worse, that resource is inside a zip which is itself inside ANOTHER zip (i.e. nested archive). \r\n\r\nPossibly you need to verify whether a particular resource is present in an ear or you want to know part of a file name but don't know which zip/jar on your hard disk contains that class file. \r\n\r\nzfind solves this problem. zfind is very fast and it works on most common archive/compress files. Apart from GUI and command line, it also provides API support which let's you use it in your java code as a 3rd party library.\r\n\r\nThanks for using, and if you find any bug, do post a ticket or discussion topic. I can't fix anything if I don't know the problem :)\r\n\r\n**Check Wiki for USAGE details", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "zfind", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/dipdatta/", "username": "dipdatta", "name": "Dipankar Datta"}], "external_homepage": "https://github.com/dipdatta/zfind"}
