From Dropbox to local. So:\r\nNo files will be added/uploaded to Dropbox, which are added locally\r\nNo Dropbox items will be removed or changed when removed or changed locally (on a new new sync they will be put back)\r\nImportant: If you are on a platform, for which the native Dropbox Application is available, use that! That is a much better working, more stable and more safe than this service. This service has been created for the platforms which are not supported by Dropbox (like Raspbmc).\r\nCheck the Dropbox site for their native Application.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xbmc-dropbox", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/josetaza/", "username": "josetaza", "name": "Joost Kop"}], "external_homepage": "http://wiki.kodi.tv/index.php?title=Add-on:Dbmc"}
