While exploring this restricted area a distinctive gleam catches Randyâ€™s eye. Randy quietly tip-toes over to it and sees that its a large red button. Like any other genetically enhanced robotic peanut would do he pushes it. Suddenly the entire research facility begins to shake and a large guardian robot plunges into the room and without warning, begins lunging medicine balls and bricks toward Randy. To counterattack Randy activates his portable force field and begins trying to deflect the debris for as long as possible.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ultrapaddleball", "developers": [], "external_homepage": "www.snailsoftware.com"}
