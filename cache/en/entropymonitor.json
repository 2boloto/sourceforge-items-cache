Without random numbers\r\nthese programs would generate the same results every time they run.\r\n\r\nHigh security uses for entropy would be applications that create cryptographic keys. \r\nEven after the key is eventually replaced, everything it was used to encrypt remains\r\nonly as safe as the entropy used to generate the key.\r\n\r\nThis monitor checks the amount of available entropy and informs the system adminstrator about possible bottlenecks on his system.", "shortname": "entropymonitor", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Monitor of the available entropy stored within the Linux kernel", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Subversion", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 744469}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/entropymonitor/", "video_url": ""}
