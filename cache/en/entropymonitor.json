This randomness is often collected from hardware sources, either pre-existing ones such as mouse movements or specially provided randomness generators.\r\n\r\nExamples for applications that depend on entropy (random numbers) would be the fortune(6) program, which gives a\r\nrandom quote, or the solitaire\r\ncard game, or the shuffle option in a music player. Without random numbers\r\nthese programs would generate the same results every time they run.\r\n\r\nHigh security uses for entropy would be applications that create cryptographic keys. \r\nEven after the key is eventually replaced, everything it was used to encrypt remains\r\nonly as safe as the entropy used to generate the key.\r\n\r\nThis monitor checks the amount of available entropy and informs the system adminstrator about possible bottlenecks on his system.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "entropymonitor", "_id": "4f846bdf1be1ce77f900013c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "Subversion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 744469, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Monitor of the available entropy stored within the Linux kernel", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "shortname": "security", "fullname": "Security", "id": 43}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System", "shortname": "system", "fullname": "System", "id": 136}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
