It will track down the instrument and song files from bank references even if they were saved on another disk.  There also exists a disk mapping feature to correct for any errors in this process caused by having relabeled disks, forgotten to label disks, etc.\r\n\r\nEnDiskEx has been tested and validated against a variety of RAW, GKH, EDE, and EDA images files the dev team has, including but not limited to, the ASR factory disks, the EPS 16+ factory disks, and the EPS (classic) factory disks.", "shortname": "endiskex", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Bulk extractor for Ensoniq-formatted disk images", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 730262}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/endiskex/", "video_url": ""}
