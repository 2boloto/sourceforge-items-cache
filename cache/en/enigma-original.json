If I remember correctly, we were given two weeks to work on the final. Tristan and I started early in the year and worked on it for months before the final was even assigned. The game got us our 100% and certainly impressed our fellow classmates.\r\n\r\nWhen we look back at Enigma, we realize that when we started it, we knew next to nothing about object orientation, inheritance or the lack of efficiency of some of the techniques that we were using. Throughout the time we spent on it, doing extensive external research on topics such as pathfinding, raytracing, and rendering, we learned quite a bit about the Java API, programming in general with various techniques and how to do them efficiently, and last but not least, how to work as a team.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "enigma-original", "_id": "52d08ce6485acd7d7c3d494c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2070237, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Enigma is a completed top down zombie survival game written in Java.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 7 - Inactive", "shortname": "inactive", "fullname": "7 - Inactive", "id": 358}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "shortname": "sidescrolling", "fullname": "Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "id": 288}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java AWT", "shortname": "ui_awt", "fullname": "Java AWT", "id": 470}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Win2K", "shortname": "mswin_2000", "fullname": "Win2K", "id": 420}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
