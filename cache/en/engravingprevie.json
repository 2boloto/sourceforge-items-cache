After looking at other sites and searching for code that was already available, I decided to create my own from scratch using Flash and jQuery. It turned out pretty awesome and it's a great way to allow customers to preview what they're purchasing. You can take a look at the implementation here http://www.cornerstonejewelrydesigns.com/rings/purity-rings.html - you will need to click on a product to see how it works.\r\n\r\nI also created a way to change the font on the Flash file, but didn't feel like that should be part of this repo because of the licensing issues with fonts. Feel free to modify it yourself and come up with a cooler implementation.", "shortname": "engravingprevie", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 988629}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/engravingprevie/", "video_url": ""}
