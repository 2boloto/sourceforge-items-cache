Energy efficiency is one of the main problems in a Mobile network, especially in designing a routing protocol. In this technique, we surveyed and classified a number of energy aware routing schemes. In many cases, it is difficult to compare them directly since each method has a different goal with different assumptions and employs different means to achieve. For example, when the transmission power is controllable, the optimal adjustment of the power level is essential not only for energy conservation but also for the interference control. When node density or traffic density is far from uniform, a load distribution approach must be employed to alleviate the energy imbalance problem. The sleep/power-down mode approach is essentially independent of the other two approaches because it focuses on inactivity energy.", "shortname": "energypowerefficientroutingns2", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Energy / Power Efficient Routing in WSN", "tools": [{"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1956643}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/energypowerefficientroutingns2/", "video_url": ""}
