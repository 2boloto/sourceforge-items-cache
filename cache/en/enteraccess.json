It is an alternative to the JDBC interface UCanAccess, whose metadata and type support and very limited SQL for DDL and DML queries could not be adapted for the purposes of SIARD.\r\nCurrently EnterAccess queries are limited to a single table. All DML and DDL queries are limited by the capabilities of Jackcess, which is good at reading a database and weak on creating a view, creating foreign keys, or modifying a schema.", "shortname": "enteraccess", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Full JAVA JDBC Interface to MS Access using Jackcess", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2389755}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/enteraccess/", "video_url": null}
