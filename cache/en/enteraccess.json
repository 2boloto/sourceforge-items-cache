It was developed to support the Software-Independent Archival of Relational Databases (SIARD) of the Swiss Federal Institute. It is based on the project Jackcess for accessing MS Access files and makes use of the project H2 for parsing SQL. It is an alternative to the JDBC interface UCanAccess, whose metadata and type support and very limited SQL for DDL and DML queries could not be adapted for the purposes of SIARD.\r\nCurrently EnterAccess queries are limited to a single table. All DML and DDL queries are limited by the capabilities of Jackcess, which is good at reading a database and weak on creating a view, creating foreign keys, or modifying a schema.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "enteraccess", "_id": "54ad03bda02bb1423871fa8b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2389755, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Full JAVA JDBC Interface to MS Access using Jackcess", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Database", "shortname": "database", "fullname": "Database", "id": 66}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "id": 16}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: JDBC", "shortname": "db_api_jdbc", "fullname": "JDBC", "id": 502}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: Microsoft Access", "shortname": "db_msaccess", "fullname": "Microsoft Access", "id": 518}], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
