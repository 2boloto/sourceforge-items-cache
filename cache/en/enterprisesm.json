ESM allows you the system administrator configure database connections and other resources which are available to all scripts running on the system. The scripts then do not need to worry about database credentials, reporting templates, parameter parsing etc. All scripts can be organized into groups so they are made available to some but not all users. Users create jobs and input parameters based on the scripts they have access to, they can get updates on the job status while it's running (messages are generated by the scripts to show progress), job results are stored indefinitely so users may always go back to see past results with a job name and description.
