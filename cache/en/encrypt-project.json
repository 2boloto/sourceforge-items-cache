Your note passing, personal diary and more is safe. As well as that, it can decode your GZIP messages back into plain text so it can be read again. It is written entirely in Java, and is very easy to use. For more information on this application, please refer to my YouTube tutorial or send me an email at romejanic@gmail.com.
