Differ from the well-known multi-layered slab tissue model (MCML), our model employs multi-layered hollow cylinder which emitting and receiving light both from the inner boundary to meet the conditions of endoscopy. Inhomogeneous sphere can also be added in tissue layers to model cancer or other abnormal changes. The Endo-MCML is based on the MCML while some key algorithms especially the boundary hitting judgment and the\r\nreflectance/transmittance calculation are developed to meet the condition of curved boundaries. This model can be used for the forward modeling of light transport during endoscopically diffuse optical spectroscopy, light scattescattering spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy and other static optical detection or imaging technologies.", "shortname": "endomcml", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "MC model of Endoscopic Optical Spectroscopy for tubular organ", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2340102}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/endomcml/", "video_url": null}
