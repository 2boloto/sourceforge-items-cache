Dranzer, a tool that enables users to examine effective techniques for fuzz testing ActiveX controls has been developed. The Vulnerabilities in ActiveX controls has increased in past years. Presently the Dranzer is the most effective tool for testing ActiveX controls, but does not have a GUI and does not support object modeling lifetime. This paper presents Enhancements in Dranzer which would enhance performance of Dranzer. The enhanced Dranzer can be developed by creating a GUI , With multiple API calls, in sequence and at random, extracting fuzz repository from Dranzer and making it Dynamic.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "enhanceddranzer", "_id": "4f37efdd1be1ce7b8d000665", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 690017, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Detects Vulnerabilities in ActiveX Controls", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
