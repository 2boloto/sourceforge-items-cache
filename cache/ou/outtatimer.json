Based on the .NET framework, this program allows users to set a single countdown timer, save a list of frequently used countdown timers, or simply count up from zero.  The timer playlist can be run in sequence, which is perfect for scripted situations like presentations, or time-sensitive choreographed events like broadcast scheduling and event management.  This application was developed in the first place as an aide for benchmarking processes that required many different time intervals.  User created playlists can be saved and imported, insuring you always have the right set of timers for the occasion.\r\n\r\nFuture features may include PowerPoint integration and actionable triggers (think cron job or scheduled task) that can fire after a given timer expires.\r\n\r\nUltimately the goal is for this to become a must-have utility in everyone's 'Accessories' folder.", "shortname": "outtatimer", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Versatile countdown timer/stopwatch for Windows", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 815137}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/outtatimer/", "video_url": ""}
