The Framework is easy to use. Therefore, with few interfaces implementations you can already run advanced combinatory solutions.\r\n\r\nJust to name a few algorithms, the Framework can solve any constraints problems using:\r\n\r\n- Regular Backtracking;\r\n- A variety of Backjumping algorithms;\r\n- A variety of arc-consistency algorithms;\r\n- Local search algorithm;\r\n- Tabu search algorithm;\r\n- Maximize solutions: comming soon;\r\n- Minimize solutions: comming soon;\r\n\r\nThe Framework also enables heuristic injections so that the developers can achieve greater performance of algorithms using their own heuristics.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0: Released!\r\nVersion 1.1: Coming soon\r\n\r\nSee the tutorial in the Wiki page to learn how to use this Framework.", "shortname": "jconstraints", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Java Framework to implement solutions to solve constraints problems ", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2052497}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jconstraints/", "video_url": null}
