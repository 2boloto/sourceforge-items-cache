It arose out of a problem of having multiple hosts with the same content on them which would fill up limited backup storage. To avoid storing the same content multiple times, the application does a hash of the file (technically it can be extended to any content), check to see if it exists on the backup server and then sends the content to the backup server for storage. Since the majority of the CPU demand is distributed across the clients, a single backup server can scale to a large number of clients. Clients can communicate with multiple server instances so the product can scale to large environments\r\nThe server component works well on Linux and Macs. Client works on Linux, Mac, and Window hosts. Requires Java 1.6 or greater.\r\nIt requires a separate database instance to store the content hashes and file references. Database can be separate from the server instance. Client can communicate with multiple servers", "shortname": "jcasper", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Content addressable storage system for host backup", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1449050}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jcasper/", "video_url": ""}
