It is mainly constructed around the Java JAI library and furthermore it incorporates the functionality of the popular ImageJ image processing software. Single images, image sequences or an image stack can be processed in an interchangeable manner. Image processing settings can be easily adapted to a set of images by using an image manager. The final processing of a stack of images can be done without any additional programming steps. The image manager is a central part of IQM\u2019s architecture and allows a rapid comparison between different image processing settings. Parallel processing of image sequences is supported, too. It is possible to load and process large image stacks in a virtual mode without loading all images into memory.", "shortname": "iqm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Scientific Image and Signal Analysis in Java", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Source", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1066028}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Forum", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Javadoc", "mount_point": "apidoc", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/iqm/", "video_url": null}
