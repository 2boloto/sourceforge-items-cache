management accountants, not (only) for statisticians and data mining experts. \r\n\r\nCarefully arranged default settings make sure you can concentrate on Cenobi's many accounting features rather than worrying about setting up artificial neural networks or genetic algorithms, which are the main machine learning tools under Cenobi's hood.\r\n\r\nCenobi's main benefits are:\r\n- ease of use\r\n- Utilizing artificial neural networks to estimate cost relationships, Cenobi is able to reflect the non-linear cost-behavior, that occurs in most business processes.\r\n- This makes your cost estimations more accurate and reliable.\r\n- Therefore Cenobi facilitates better informed management decisions.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cenobi is particularly suitable for management accounting purposes, it can also be used as a general machine learning tool. The neural networks at the heart of the program are fully object-oriented and therefore highly adaptable.
