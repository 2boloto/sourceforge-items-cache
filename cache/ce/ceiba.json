Ceiba is not a program for building phylogenies or analyzing comparative data. It is a program for tree visualization, exploration, and education. It provides interactive 3D and 2D tree layouts in a hierarchical display meant to ease navigation in potentially a very large and complex object, a phylogenetic tree.\r\n\r\nTo get started, download from 'Files' menu above.", "shortname": "ceiba", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Scalable phylogeny visualization with images", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2060361}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ceiba/", "video_url": ""}
