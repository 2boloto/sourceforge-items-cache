Ceiba is not a program for building phylogenies or analyzing comparative data. It is a program for tree visualization, exploration, and education. It provides interactive 3D and 2D tree layouts in a hierarchical display meant to ease navigation in potentially a very large and complex object, a phylogenetic tree.\r\n\r\nTo get started, download from 'Files' menu above.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ceiba", "_id": "52bda772b9363c41f821a15f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2060361, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Scalable phylogeny visualization with images", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
