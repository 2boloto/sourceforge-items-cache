If you don't mind paying a price for this sort of power, this app is one of the best spying apps you can find.\r\nTo get this app on your phone, you need to sign up for an account and then bypass the Google Play store. Be careful not to install it on a phone you don't legally own, since that would be breaking the law. The app not only actively monitors the targeted smartphone or tablet, but also it pulls any old calls, texts, chats, and GPS information. The app even targets social media, supporting some of the most popular options like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Vibr. You view everything the phone is doing in real time thanks to TheTruthSpy's handy, gorgeous online control panel.", "shortname": "cellphonetracker", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "TheTruthSpy is an application who allow you to monitoring an iPhone/iP", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1974451}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cellphonetracker/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/X2p5Xw8G3tg?rel=0"}
