Bi-WSLP runs fast and provides a response rapidly, yet it takes a small code size occupies small memory. Bi-WSLP can be easily ported to various hardware platforms because it is coded in C, which is the most popular programming language for embedded systems. In addition, Bi-WSLP allows transmission of large-size data such as still images as well as common sensor data such as temperature and humidity. Bi-WSLP can be modified to conform to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.\r\nBi-WSLP supports bidirectional data transmission, so it allows a user not only to control the operation of sensor nodes immediately, but also to receive responses to the user almost in real-time.", "shortname": "g-iot", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "IoT Device, Gateway, Server platform", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1945761}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/g-iot/", "video_url": ""}
