Bi-WSLP runs fast and provides a response rapidly, yet it takes a small code size occupies small memory. Bi-WSLP can be easily ported to various hardware platforms because it is coded in C, which is the most popular programming language for embedded systems. In addition, Bi-WSLP allows transmission of large-size data such as still images as well as common sensor data such as temperature and humidity. Bi-WSLP can be modified to conform to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.\r\nBi-WSLP supports bidirectional data transmission, so it allows a user not only to control the operation of sensor nodes immediately, but also to receive responses to the user almost in real-time.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "g-iot", "_id": "5226ee54ea406b6d376acbb5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1945761, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "IoT Device, Gateway, Server platform", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking :: Firewalls", "shortname": "firewalls", "fullname": "Firewalls", "id": 151}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
