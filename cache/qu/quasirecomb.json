This population, shaped by the combination of genetic change and selection, is called quasispecies. Genetic change is due to both point mutations and recombination events. We present a jumping hidden Markov model that describes the generation of the viral quasispecies and a method to infer its parameters by analysing next generation sequencing data. We offer an implementation of the EM algorithm to find maximum a posteriori estimates of the model parameters and a method to estimate the distribution of viral strains in the quasispecies. The model is validated on simulated data, showing the advantage of explicitly taking the recombination process into account, and tested by applying to reads obtained from experimental HIV samples.", "shortname": "quasirecomb", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "moved", "summary": "Probabilistic inference of viral Quasispecies", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1230100}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/quasirecomb/", "video_url": ""}
