Both are written to be as lightweight as possible so they can run with minimal memory-requirements on a desktop or laptop as well as on a compute cluster.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems with QUASR, please do contact me at the email address provided in the README.", "shortname": "quasr", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Cross-platform NGS processing and analysis pipeline in Python", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 518432}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/quasr/", "video_url": ""}
