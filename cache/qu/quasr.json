Although originally written for viral data, it is generic enough to work on any NGS dataset. Functions include:\r\nduplicate removal\r\ndemultiplexing\r\nprimer-removal\r\nquality-assurance (QA) graphing\r\nquality control (QC)\r\nconsensus-generation\r\nminority-variant determination\r\nminority-variant graphing\r\n\r\nThe main current version is 6.X, which is written in Python3. 7.X is my rewrite in Java, but is still work in progress. Both are written to be as lightweight as possible so they can run with minimal memory-requirements on a desktop or laptop as well as on a compute cluster.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems with QUASR, please do contact me at the email address provided in the README.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "quasr", "_id": "516d83ae2718467b6144638b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 518432, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Cross-platform NGS processing and analysis pipeline in Python", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
