Please see the discussion page on where to begin.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical advantage of Quantum Chess is that it automatically prunes redundant moves unlike iterative/branching models while maintaining strategy-like behavior completely unlike both chess AIs and humans. \r\n\r\nIt is intended as an experiment to play against itself, and later to interface to other computers and humans.  This should help form the basis for understanding real-world problems in a completely different way.\r\n\r\nLet this be an experiment into how we think about objects and waves as much as a viable ai chess alternative.", "shortname": "quantumchess", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Discovers optimal chess moves from quantum-like wave-functions", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1055435}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/quantumchess/", "video_url": ""}
