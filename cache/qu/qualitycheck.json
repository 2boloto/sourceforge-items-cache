It provides similar features to org.springframework.util.Assert or com.google.common.base.Preconditions without the need to include big libraries or frameworks such as Spring or Guava. The package quality-check tries to replace these libraries and provide all the basic code quality checks you need.\r\n\r\nThe checks provided here are typically used to validate method parameters and detect errors during runtime. To detect errors before runtime we use JSR-305 Annotations. With these annotations you are able to detect possible bugs earlier. For more informations look at FindBugs\u2122 JSR-305 support.\r\n\r\nWe noticed that many projects just copy org.springframework.util.Assert or com.google.common.base.Preconditions to get access to these quality checks. Therefore we provide these features and small library that can be included in any application without big overhead.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "qualitycheck", "_id": "5040c938b9363c471574f9d6", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 876170, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Quality-Check is a small Java library for basic runtime checks of vars", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing", "shortname": "testing", "fullname": "Testing", "id": 575}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache License V2.0", "shortname": "apache2", "fullname": "Apache License V2.0", "id": 401}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
