Program uses Qtimers, Qtime, many signal mapping objects, a simple system bell...and a bunch of other ui controls. So...play with it :) Turn system volume down, no volume control is enabled in this release! Sound is system alert. I'm not responsible for any damage on your system, try it under your responsibility.
