This will facilitate the development of preventive, predictive and personalized medicine for specific diseases and will promote health and wellness. We use a number of high-throughput analytical platforms including multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MDLC-MS) for proteomics, and for metabolomics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC/TOF-MS). Each type of analysis affords limited analyte coverage of molecules present in a patient sample and therefore provides only a partial molecular profile for an individual patient. These diverse analytical data must be integrated with advanced bioinformatics methods for accurate evaluation of health and detection of disease susceptibility.", "shortname": "metaopen", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Metabolomics Bioinformatics Tools", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1205776}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/metaopen/", "video_url": ""}
