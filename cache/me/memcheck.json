It uses the memory paging system to allocate a guard page after each page of memory to provide a hardware boundary that can detect memory overflows.  This allows for immediate detection of buffer overflow error conditions.\r\n\r\nThere are many other memory checker programs in existence - why do we need another?  This Hardware Memory Checker provides a combination of features not found in other memory checkers.\r\n- it uses the hardware paging system for immediate error detection (most other memory checkers look for modified memory in no mans land)\r\n- it is very fast compared to other hardware memory checkers because it makes fewer changes to the paging tables\r\n- it can track the original release location when debugging duplicate free problems\r\n- it is designed for large scale integration with the ability to call user defined fail functions", "shortname": "memcheck", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Hardware Memory Checker", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 985795}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/memcheck/", "video_url": ""}
