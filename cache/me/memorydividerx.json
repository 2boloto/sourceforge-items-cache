It's written in C++ under the Apache license for Windows and Linux on 32 & 64 bit systems.\r\n\r\nPrograms using MDX provide it with a marking callback. The callback performs the marking phase of garbage collection, using MDX's mark() method to actually mark the wanted memory blocks. Finalization is similarly accomplished by callback. The rest of the garbage collection process is managed automatically by MDX.\r\n\r\nThe novel approach of allowing finalization to explicitly free memory offers the potential for improving garbage collection performance. This is achieved by moving some work from being done repetitively during every marking cycle, to being done once only when the memory's freed.\r\n\r\nSee the project web site at the link below for more information.", "shortname": "memorydividerx", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Memory Manager: MDX = malloc() + free() + Garbage Collection", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 737329}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/memorydividerx/", "video_url": ""}
