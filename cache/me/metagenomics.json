The project is supported by Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF).  \r\n\r\nThe algorithm is based on the concept of a small set sub-sequence which called Punctuator. The punctuator can be used to uniquely match the sub-sequence, and then extended the alignment from the punctuator. The algorithm has two versions, one for single machine, and the other one for MapReduce framework.
