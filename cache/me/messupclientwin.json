A chat-window then appears on the site.\r\n\r\nThe client is a Windows software, which connects to the chat on one or more of your websites. It will notify the owner about incoming chat communication and allows to chat with the website visitors.\r\n\r\nThere are many sophisticated website-chat solutions on the market for sales and support purposes. In contrary to most of them, MESSUP Chat is not a cloud solution, so your chat conversations stay on your (hosting provider's) server. It is also intended to be very tiny and very easy to install.\r\n\r\nWe, the authors, use the software on our own websites and hope it may be useful for somebody.", "shortname": "messupclientwin", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "MessupChat", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Chat with your current website customers!
