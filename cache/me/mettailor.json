MetTailor is a software package that performs post-extraction processing steps such as cross-sample realignment and data normalization that are specifically designed to account for the experimental factors from chromatographic separation and MS analysis. The two major components are:\r\n\r\n(1) A dynamic block summarization method for peak intensity data to correct mis-aligned peak features across the samples, significantly alleviating the missing data problem. \r\n\r\n(2) A novel data normalization procedure that adaptively adjusts the normalizing factor for the temporal variation in the chromatography based on the data from local retention time regions. \r\n", "shortname": "mettailor", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "MetTailor: Dynamic Block Summary and Data Normalization for Robust Ana", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2396205}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mettailor/", "video_url": null}
