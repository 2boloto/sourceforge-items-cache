I will be using openGL to render these as either wire meshes or curved sheets.  The plan is to be able to manipulate the mesh to set up waves and vibrations.  I will also aim to be able to drop objects onto sheets and simulate the resulting behaviour accurately.\r\n\r\nEssentially I am aiming for something that will give a fairly realistic rendering of what would happen if you dropped a bowling ball onto a trampoline.", "shortname": "meshsimulator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simulation of flexible meshes and sheets", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2085260}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/meshsimulator/", "video_url": ""}
