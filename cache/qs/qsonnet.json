Other applications include E-commerce, company intranets, and distance learning. QSonnet is based on 2 languages, QuadraScript and QSON. QuadraScript is similar to JavaScript, but with a simpler syntax. QuadraScript Object Notation (QSON) is used in place of HTML, and is very similar to JSON. However, QSON syntax is similar to QuadraScript, whereby parentheses are used for all grouping (except string literals are delimited with double quotes). Every QSON tag has a type property, which can either correspond to a built-in HTML tag, or a widget such as a button or checkbox. QSON widgets are called quadras. High-level game quadras include panel (similar to a top-level window), zone-grid (regions where multiple players congregate), and match (a 2-player animated game). QSonnet databases are built with MongoDB.", "shortname": "qsonnet", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "abandoned", "summary": "Easily create multi-user HTML5 apps", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1878163}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/qsonnet/", "video_url": null}
