The learning process can be carried out in real time together with the interaction process. A basic building block for supporting state models of finite automatons is adaptive probabilistic mapping, which for an argument from its domain returns more often results that maximize or minimize values of one or more objective functions. Finite automatons can be represented by assembler programs with user-defined instructions that perform effective work. To assist in the learning of a finite automaton, a template for its state model can be provided as an assembler program with probabilistic jump instructions.\r\n\r\nThe operating principle behind the framework resembles the Boltzmann machine.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "qsmm", "_id": "50c4a40c5fcbc9099b9fdc37", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 281041, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A framework for the development of intelligent systems.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Simulations", "shortname": "simulations", "fullname": "Simulations", "id": 600}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence :: Machine Learning", "shortname": "machinelearning", "fullname": "Machine Learning", "id": 802}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: Cygwin (MS Windows)", "shortname": "cygwin", "fullname": "Cygwin (MS Windows)", "id": 427}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "shortname": "mingw_msys", "fullname": "MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "id": 445}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
