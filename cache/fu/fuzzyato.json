It is pretty\r\nsimple. It works on a very simple memory model. The idea is, it present a\r\nquestion, once you recall the answer, you say - Show. If the answer is correct,\r\nyou say it was correct, else say it was wrong. Take as long as you want to\r\nremember the answer.\r\n\r\nIf you get the correct answer, you are scored depending on how long you took to\r\nanswer the question. < 5 secs implies you know the answer well enough, this gets\r\nyou *HALF* the max score. Once you cross this threshold, you are presented with\r\nthe answer and you have to get the question. Same scoring rules apply, but if\r\nyou get the question right, you get twice the score.\r\n\r\nDepending on your score, you will be presented with the question after a certain\r\ntime. That is, if you didnt get the answer, you will be presented with the same\r\nquestion after around 10 mins. If you got a decent score (3/4th max), you'll see\r\nthe question again after a week and so on.", "shortname": "fuzzyato", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Ato: A tool to remember", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1109156}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fuzzyato/", "video_url": ""}
