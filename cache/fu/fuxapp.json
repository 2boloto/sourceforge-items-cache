Strict counterpoint is a formally defined musical style that originates in the 16th century. The rules of this style were written down by Johan Fux in his book \"Gradus Ad Parnassum\" in 1725. This app generates a continuous stream of music that adheres to these rules as well as possible, hence the name of the app. The VNS algorithm used in FuX takes into account 19 melodic and 19 harmonic rules when evaluating the quality of the generated fragment. A detailed description of both these rules and the algorithm can be found in the publications available here.\r\n\r\nFrom a large collection of existing music, a model was developed that allows the classification of musical pieces per composer. This model was then integrated in the VNS. Version 2.0 of FuX uses this model to generate counterpoint with composer-specific characteristics based on the user's input.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fuxapp", "_id": "512b2c3cf1fd8d3dbc87f194", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1307466, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Are you a composer looking for ideas?
