This is especially true during my daily commute of about 35 miles each way.\r\n\r\nIt may come as a surprise to some outside the UK (particularly in the USA), but the average price for diesel fuel here is around \u00a31.38.9 per litre or often more.  Petrol (gasoline) is slightly cheaper, but only by a few pence, and of course gets you nowhere near the milage.  \r\n\r\nAt current rates, this works out at nearly USD $8.50 per gallon.
