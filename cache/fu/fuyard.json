Several sensors detect the presence of obstacles in the near range. The car maneuvers to keep clear from all obstacles.\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\n- Build-up some knowledge about robotics\r\n- Integrate existing components rather than develop them.\r\n\r\nLogical architecture:\r\nProject has several layers, each aiming to a higher level of abstraction:\r\n- Level one: The servo control and the sensor reading.\r\n- Level two: The throttle and steering control.\r\n- Level three: The pre-programmed maneuver engine.\r\n- Level four: The pilot.\r\n\r\nThe pilot takes decisions based on the sensors, and executes maneuvers in sequences.\r\n\r\nTechnical architecture\r\n- PIC18F as micro-controllers. \r\n- Multithreading is achieved via I2C bus.\r\n- Microchip's XC18 used for the initial coding.\r\n\r\nLong term objective:\r\nIn the future, a ARD platform may be added, to implement more sophisticated pilot, sensors (camera, image recognition, etc).\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fuyard", "_id": "51189f2024b0d95b656bbb6d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1276856, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Fleeing car based on a RC model", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Robotics", "shortname": "robotics", "fullname": "Robotics", "id": 602}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
