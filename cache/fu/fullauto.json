With FullAuto, connections are PERSISTANT enabling state preservation of file system navigations, environment manipulations, and user context shifting. Output and error messages from remote commands are returned accurately from both STDOUT and STDERR channels. With FullAuto persisent SSH/SFTP connections, automated processes can be DYNAMIC, intelligent and responsive - precisely in the same manner that highly trained professionals work with SSH/SFTP tools, to perform countless tasks manually. FullAuto works with the naked protocol, and connects directly with ordinary SSH/SFTP servers that already exist on nearly every UNIX platform, and many Windows and MAC systems. NO OTHER REMOTE SOFTWARE IS NEEDED. FullAuto is written entirely in Perl and has been tested on Linux, UNIX and Windows with Cygwin.", "shortname": "fullauto", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/fullautosoftware", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Fully Automate ANY Process with *Persistent* SSH/SFTP from One Host", "tools": [{"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1986587}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fullauto/", "video_url": null}
