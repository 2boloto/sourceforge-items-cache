It is a great utility used in Unix/Linux for figuring out what process(es) have a file open (among other stuff).\r\n\r\nMany would say, \"why not use handle.exe from SysInternals?\"\r\n\r\nWhile being a truly excellent utility (as all of SysInternals stuff is), it falls short -- at least for me -- for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n1) It does filename pattern matching.  I need it to do exact file matches with partial input.  For example, when I'm in the C:\\TMP directory, and I'm checking on a file named 'out.dat', I want it to see if the file C:\\TMP\\OUT.DAT is being used without having to type the full path in.  I think even if you type in the full path for handle.exe, it will still do pattern matching.\r\n\r\n2) Handle.exe seems to always exit 0.  For scripting purposes, I need it to exit 1 if the file is not being used, but 0 if it is.  This is very useful in scripts.\r\n", "shortname": "fuserforwin32", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "fuser v0.5 for windows / win32", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1074365}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fuserforwin32/", "video_url": ""}
