It is a great utility used in Unix/Linux for figuring out what process(es) have a file open (among other stuff).\r\n\r\nMany would say, \"why not use handle.exe from SysInternals?\"\r\n\r\nWhile being a truly excellent utility (as all of SysInternals stuff is), it falls short -- at least for me -- for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n1) It does filename pattern matching.  I need it to do exact file matches with partial input.  For example, when I'm in the C:\\TMP directory, and I'm checking on a file named 'out.dat', I want it to see if the file C:\\TMP\\OUT.DAT is being used without having to type the full path in.  I think even if you type in the full path for handle.exe, it will still do pattern matching.\r\n\r\n2) Handle.exe seems to always exit 0.  For scripting purposes, I need it to exit 1 if the file is not being used, but 0 if it is.  This is very useful in scripts.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fuserforwin32", "_id": "509efc4b04161f428e84f47a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1074365, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "fuser v0.5 for windows / win32", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Other/Nonlisted Topic", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other/Nonlisted Topic", "id": 234}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Microsoft Windows Server 2003", "shortname": "mswin_server2003", "fullname": "Microsoft Windows Server 2003", "id": 448}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
