The platform independent architecture integrates well with existing systems.  A REST API enables developers to support and enhance the features of limited solutions and bring connectivity to disparate healthcare systems.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the Neuron EHR Quick Tour video series on YouTube here: http://goo.gl/T4V55X\r\n", "shortname": "neuronhealth", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "neuronHealth", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Web based EHR and tools using a smart longitudinal patient record.", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2260894}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/neuronhealth/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/T1OZXI-tddY?rel=0"}
