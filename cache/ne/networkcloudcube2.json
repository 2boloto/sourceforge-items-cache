Infrastructure idea is to combine the low-end and high-performance computing resources in a computing environment using virtualization layer and interfaces.\r\nNetwork Cloud Cube-2 is a model of hyper virtualization digital universe, which brings together the federation of clouds. We propose a series of models that are part of a unified infrastructure concept: Converged Model, Cloud Model, Telemetering Cloud, Model of Hyper Virtualization, IoTPaaS, dynamic security model Converged Security Model, Cloud Ring, routing model in a converged infrastructure, Cloud-to-Cloud and Fabric -to-Fabric.", "shortname": "networkcloudcube2", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "NetworkCloudCub", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Model of Hyper Virtualization", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1973723}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/networkcloudcube2/", "video_url": ""}
