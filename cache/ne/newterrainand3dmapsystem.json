Seme as at point 1. , but with a road-network rendering and collision-detection module I wrote before. It also adds some trees at the top of the terrain. (multitread vesion not released yet)\r\n3. Seme as point 2.. Multithread terrain-rendering, roads on it, and vehicles to go around. \r\n\r\nThe most important part is terrain-rendering. The Algorithm at the heart of it features my first and second theorem abut polygonal surface approximation. It took something like 2 years to develop it. It's technically a view-dependent, continuous dynamic level-of-detail rendering algorithm. Main features are simplicity and documentation.\r\n\r\nDoes easily a 4k x 4k terrain, but also much more.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "newterrainand3dmapsystem", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "a very lightweight advanced terrain-rendering and 3D map rendering sys", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2451066}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/newterrainand3dmapsystem/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/j0cEMqJje9w?rel=0"}
