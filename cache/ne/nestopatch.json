The program includes tools both for basic analysis of wholce-cell recordings or analysis of single channel properties. Single channel conductance, kinetics, NPo, as well as number of channels in a patch and their open probability may be estimated with the analysis of dwelling time at each conductance level. The program directly reads files, created by Pulse and PatchMaster software (HEKA Elektronik Dr. Schulze GmbH) as well as ASCII files. \r\nHowever, the program may be useful in various applications when limited editing and measurements in a 2-dimentional (for example time-current) wave are required. The program itself does not make any assumptions about units of the recordings, it deals only with X-values and Y-values.", "shortname": "nestopatch", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Software for analysis of patch-clamp recordings and other wave data", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1898810}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/nestopatch/", "video_url": null}
