NewApp has two modes, a \u2018design\u2019 mode and a \u2018user\u2019 mode. Both modes are integrated in the same user interface. During the design phase, one may switch between the two modes. When the design is finished, one may \u2018lock\u2019 the design (the 'source code') from being accessible to users. At that point the new application is ready for end-user use and/or distribution. Since the new designed application is stored as a single XML file, the application can be shared with anyone who has NewApp installed, independent of the operation system used. NewApp includes a special feature, which enables applications designed in NewApp to be stored as stand-alone executables.\r\n\r\nNewApp applications can best be thought of as 'circuits.' A circuit in NewApp consists of several 'components' which can be connected with each other by means of 'connections'. Also circuits can be connected with each other.
