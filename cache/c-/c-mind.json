This 3rd version (started in 2006) helps to implement, preserve, share and reproduce the whole experimental setup as connected modules and data.\r\n\r\ncM uses crowdsourcing to leverage knowledge and computational resources of multiple users. For example, it includes multi-objective GCC, LLVM and ICC auto-tuning scenarios using shared benchmarks, codelets, data sets, tools, and combined with classification and predictive models. cM includes OpenME interactive interface to open up and expose internals of various third-party tools such as GCC, LLVM, run-time systems, etc. and connect them to cM through dynamic plugins that allows online analysis and tuning of programs and architectures. \r\n\r\nLive repo: http://c-mind.org/repo\r\n\r\nNOTE: NEW VERSION MOVED HERE: http://github.com/ctuning/ck\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "c-mind", "_id": "514ae1bbf1fd8d5633ec341d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1402778, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "plugin-based framework for systematic and reproducible experimentation", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Database", "shortname": "database", "fullname": "Database", "id": 66}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "id": 97}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 71}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (DB) :: Project is a file-based DBMS (database system)", "shortname": "db_group_filedbms", "fullname": "Project is a file-based DBMS (database system)", "id": 512}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: Flat-file", "shortname": "db_file_flat", "fullname": "Flat-file", "id": 521}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Plugins", "shortname": "ui_plugins", "fullname": "Plugins", "id": 461}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
