This plugin does not rely on Netbeans native bookmarks.  This plugin works with Netbeans 7.0.1, which does not invoke the garbage collector as often as successive versions.  This is desirable when the -J-XX:+AggressiveHeap option is used.\r\n\r\nSet bookmarks in any text file.  Group and organize bookmarks in a hierarchy.  Bookmarks are saved in Netbeans preferences with the option to save/load them to/from a file.  There is also an ability to open bookmarks in the main project, instead of their original project.  This works great if you have multiple versions of a repository in different locations.
