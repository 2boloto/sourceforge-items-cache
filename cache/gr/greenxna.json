It will allow you to create games easier and faster. The implementation of MonoGame will allow you to release the games you create with this framework on wide range of different platforms. For more information regarding MonoGame I would like to refer you to http://monogame.codeplex.com/. \r\n\r\nThe framework is divided in different parts. Each part handles a different \"subject\". Examples of these are: Graphics, User input, File management, etc... This structure will allow you as a developer to disable one or more parts of the framework. This can be useful as you maybe prefer a different framework that handles that specific subject. \r\n\r\nThe framework isn't intended to be a all in one solution. However it will handle a wide range of subjects and thus be a great base framework for your games. The goal is to let your start working on your game code right away. Using this framework will allow you to create a prototype in minutes.", "shortname": "greenxna", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "ORPH4NUS", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Opensource Framework build with Monogame", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1805217}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/greenxna/", "video_url": ""}
