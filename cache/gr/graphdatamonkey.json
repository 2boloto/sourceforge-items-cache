In many cased this previous data does not exist in a digital form.  Many people set out drawing lines and approximating the values.  A JAVA based app was created (DataTheif III) but since there was no need to theif the data and it apeared that the application died many years ago, a new method of extracting the data was created.  This time written in the dotnet framework, it offers compatibility with Windows machines only.
