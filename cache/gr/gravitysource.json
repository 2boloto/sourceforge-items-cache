Weapons all influence gravity in some way. For example, one weapon would shoot gravity to a point on the wall which would then have a gravitational field, a gravity source which pulls opponents in and maybe traps them in a field of spikes which cause them damage.\r\n\r\nThere are other possible weapons as well:\r\n\r\nOne might be like a sling shot or another like an elastic band that pulls two entities toward each other.\r\n\r\nThere could be mini planets that have a gravitational field as well and where players can jump into another gravitational field by going on and activating a jump pad.\r\n\r\nImagination is the limit.\r\n\r\nThis is a new project and needs developers and artists.\r\n\r\nI have been working on/with jMonkeyEngine to get a basic character control working which for now can only walk around a planet.\r\n\r\nThis game should be a multi-player game where multiple, hopefully dozens of people can compete.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gravitysource", "_id": "5183abc404161f7efefd3169", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1736573, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Game That Redefines Gravity", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
