However, performing the cell counting by tagging the cells in a steady image mosaic increases the reliability of the counts performed. Unfortunately, to build a mosaic of a hemocytometer's grid shows some problem due to the repeated patterns (i.e., the squared blocks of the grid). GridMos is an open-source software tool conceived to build an image mosaic of a hemocytometer's grid. It is optimized to build the mosaic starting from a sequence of overlapping images previously acquired. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) implemented makes GridMos a very user-friendly software tool.\r\n\r\nRequirements: MATLAB 2009b (32-bit) and Image Processing Toolbox 8.1 or later versions.", "shortname": "gridmos", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "GridMos, mosaicing tool (in MATLAB) to improve cell counting.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2223305}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gridmos/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/HMYXUQ7FDN0?rel=0"}
