It gives you an ITunes style desktop music player, but without having to have any of the music on your desktop.\r\n\r\nMusic is organised by artists, albums and songs in the same way as any other desktop music player. Just type in a new artist and it's as though you instantly have all their albums available to listen to.\r\n\r\nGrooveTube will first search your Music directory for the given song and play it if available. But if the song isn't available it will find it on Youtube and play it anyway.\r\n\r\nAs with any other desktop music player you can create your own playlists.\r\n\r\nGroovetube also comes with a number of built in plugins. Such as artist bios, upcoming gigs and similar artist recommendations for the chosen artist, and lyrics, tabs, etc for the chosen song. And with many more plugins on the way.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "groovetube", "_id": "50c218eb7929e54cc0a6b3ef", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1154609, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "An ITunes style music player sourcing music from Youtube", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Players", "shortname": "players", "fullname": "Players", "id": 122}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Players :: MP3", "shortname": "mp3", "fullname": "MP3", "id": 123}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
