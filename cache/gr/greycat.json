So in the essence of it being more like the genetic code 1=Guanine 2=Thymine 3=Cytosine 4=Adenine. The code itself will follow the laws of genetic coding in the way that if you run a program made from GCat, it is actually a living organism made up of the chemicals of DNA. So if you run the program and it is built with a coding sequence that immediately causes death in the program, that program will not run. You can set how long you want the program to live (this will probably be the tutorial way on how it will be taught to users) so if you if you don't mind it not being alive for over ten seconds that is fine. Using this new programming language programmers will be able to build cures, non-artificial limbs, and helping programs which can support a person against there battle with some sort of disease.
