(MIT Press 1981).\r\n\r\nBezier curves are generated procedurally\r\nusing a turtle; control points are modified as sets whose angles and lengths are changed by various morph actions.\r\n\r\nThis method was devised long before filters like \u2018Punk\u2019, \u2018Bloat\u2019 and \u2018Twist\u2019 appeared in commercial drawing programs; and I'm sure you will agree the method used in Griselda is more sophisticated and allows far greater control of the bezier curve...
