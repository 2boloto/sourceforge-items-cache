The segmentation is produced by running multiple instances of Dijkstra's Algorithm from a set of seed points; those nodes which belong to a given Dijkstra cloud form a segment (so the number of segments is fixed and determined at the beginning of the algorithm).  The goal is to add code that moves from the over-segmentation to a more useful segmentation.  The library includes code specifically for the purpose of image segmentation but there are several components useful for general graph segmentation.
