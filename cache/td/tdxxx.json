The intent is that the code is extensible, giving the user a high level of control over new forces that impact the motions of one or more floating bodies, tethered or untetethered to one another.  All of the linearized wave-hydrodynamics is complete allowing the user to concentrate on adding problem specific behaviors to the system without having to program the relatively complicated wave-body interactions.", "shortname": "tdxxx", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Matlab code for simulation of floating body motions in the time domain", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1166897}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tdxxx/", "video_url": ""}
