As MySQL has no front-end I have been searching for years (!) to find a simple way of developing user-interaction forms which do the same as (and more than?) MS Access forms.  \r\nI've looked at lots of dbase admin front ends (PHPMyAdmin, SQLWorkbench, etc.), CMSs, CRMs and ERPs.  I've looked at Wavemaker and LibreOffice Base.  But I think there should be a project using a standard HTML server (Apache), PHP, Javascript and JQuery.  For example, JQuery's \"select2\" combo box can be adapted quite easily to do what Access \"find\" combo boxes do, using Ajax.  \r\nTwo things are essential: nested subforms, and the need to make this very robust for the average non-professional IT person to use (such as myself).\r\nPerhaps using Aptana and maybe BlueGriffon to develop simple \"wireframes\" (HTML tables) for forms ... and then drop in components which are then tweaked.\r\n\r\nAny serious people think it's got legs?", "shortname": "accessformsinhtml", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "make Access-like forms for MySQL databases, using a local webserver", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2399242}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/accessformsinhtml/", "video_url": null}
