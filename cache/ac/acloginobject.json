By creating a configuration object and then passing it to the ACLogin object constructor, the application using ACLogin can customize many of its features. It's primary targets are those applications with a poorly defined population that isn't contained in another authentication system. \r\n\r\nTo use the object, the calling application must first run a php script that builds the Javascript object that is downloaded. The application Javascript must then create an ACLoginObject instance passing it a configuration file. \r\n\r\nOriginally created at Amherst College as part of project to create an advanced map marker option for Google Maps (soon to be its own open source project called ACMapInterfaceObject), the login object has been spun-off as a community-developed open source project under the MIT/X license.
