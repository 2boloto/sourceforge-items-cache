This application is a 'grown-up' version of home budgeting and helps you to plan your cash flow.  It will help with questions like, 'When is my next bill due?', 'How much do I need to leave in my checking account to pay my direct debits this month?'.  It will automatically record direct debit events in your transaction so your balance is as accurate as possible.  It will give you reminders when you need to take action, such as manually paying a bill.  You can even check your statement against the transactions recorded and spot any suspicious activity.  It uses a visual approach to show you how well you're managing your budget with rich HTML5 graphs and charts so you always know how you're doing.  This is an HTML5, PHP & MySQL application and will run on pretty much any device (even your RaspberryPi can serve the pages!).", "shortname": "ac2homebudget", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "HTML5 Rich UI Home Budgeting Solution", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2121709}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ac2homebudget/", "video_url": null}
