I realize it needs to move from there, but all the simple data types are covered, it can do MEMO fields but that needs a little work to actually write them, but the plan was to create a modern implementation.  I have source files on that level.  I was side tracked at the time so I've not gotten that far on my own, but the DLL is able to read and write the files, I've written code that will allow for marcos and I'd like to see DBASEIII format take over.  I wasn't thrilled with the other db out there and was able to emulate the ADO way of doing things so far.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "accessxbase3", "_id": "5269da95485acd51e4ecee2f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1989162, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "AccessXBase3 is a database built on the DBASEIII platform", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
