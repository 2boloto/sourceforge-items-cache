The Activity Predictor calculates activities, exposure rates and gamma spectra of activated samples for NAA experiments. The calculation procedure\r\nfor predictions involve both analytical and Monte Carlo methods. The Activity Predictor software is validated by a series of activation experiments. It has been found that this software calculates the activities and exposure rates precisely. The software also predicts gamma spectrum for each measurement. The predicted spectra agreed partially with measured spectra. This software has a XML database which includes nuclear data for frequently used materials in NAA. Neutron Neutron cross section data from \u2018\u2018 Tables for Neutron Activation Analysis\u2019\u2019 , photon cross section data from Berger and Hubbell\u2019s XCOM photon cross sections database [ 2], and isotope decay from from Lund/LBNL database are included in this\r\ndatabase.", "shortname": "activitypredict", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "To envision the radiation exposure in Neutron Activation Experiments", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1086024}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/activitypredict/", "video_url": ""}
