The mirrors are already powered by default in the EU versions, I don't know about JDM (I think so) or US version (Acura TSX).\r\n\r\nAuto-folding from the remote doesn't come as a feature in 2009 EU Accord, although I think in does in the facelift version (2011+). I wanted to implement this is my car by keeping modifications at minimum and a simple installation. There is an eBay module which will do this, but I found that too bulky as it modified the wiring of both mirrors and needed to run a pair of cables under the dash. My system does not do that. It just tricks the system to do it.\r\n\r\nThe circuit is micro-controller based. I used a low-range PIC12 with 6 GPIOs to monitor the state of the ignition, mirrors and door, locks and \"cheat\" signal which will fold and unfold the mirrors. I own a Honda Accord 2009 warehouse manual which I used to get info from the harness, as well as a multimeter to realize how the foldin", "shortname": "accordpowermirrors", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "moved", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2168703}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/accordpowermirrors/", "video_url": null}
