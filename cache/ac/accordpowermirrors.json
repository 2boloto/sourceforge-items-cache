The mirrors are already powered by default in the EU versions, I don't know about JDM (I think so) or US version (Acura TSX).\r\n\r\nAuto-folding from the remote doesn't come as a feature in 2009 EU Accord, although I think in does in the facelift version (2011+). I wanted to implement this is my car by keeping modifications at minimum and a simple installation. There is an eBay module which will do this, but I found that too bulky as it modified the wiring of both mirrors and needed to run a pair of cables under the dash. My system does not do that. It just tricks the system to do it.\r\n\r\nThe circuit is micro-controller based. I used a low-range PIC12 with 6 GPIOs to monitor the state of the ignition, mirrors and door, locks and \"cheat\" signal which will fold and unfold the mirrors. I own a Honda Accord 2009 warehouse manual which I used to get info from the harness, as well as a multimeter to realize how the foldin", "moved_to_url": "https://sites.google.com/site/jjss87de/home/automirrors", "shortname": "accordpowermirrors", "developers": [], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 7 - Inactive", "fullname": "7 - Inactive", "shortname": "inactive", "id": 358}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
