It includes supporting PHP scripts. The image viewer supports zooming, panning, slideshow functions, tiling and more. The code includes php setup functions (both callable and standalone) and language files.\r\n\r\nTo use the object, the calling application must first run a php script that builds the Javascript object that is downloaded. The application Javascript must then create an ACViewerObject instance passing it a configuration file. Then the application uses an API call to create an individual viewer.\r\n\r\nOriginally created at Amherst College as part of project to create an advanced map marker option for Google Maps (soon to be its own open source project called ACMapInterfaceObject), the viewer object has been spun-off as a community-developed open source project under the MIT/X license.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "acviewerobject", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/pdchapin/", "username": "pdchapin", "name": "Paul Chapin"}], "external_homepage": ""}
