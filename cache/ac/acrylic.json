What Acrylic does is to reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses as close to zero as possible.\r\n\r\nWith Acrylic you can also gracefully overcome short downtimes of your DNS servers without disrupting your work, because in this case you will at least be able to connect to your favourite sites and to your email server. \r\n\r\nIn addition Acrylic can help you to effectively block unwanted ads prior to their download through the use of a HOSTS file with support for wildcards and regular expressions, optimizing your navigation experience even further.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "acrylic", "_id": "516485b634309d2e91ef2bb8", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 139388, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A local DNS proxy which improves your Internet performance", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "shortname": "communications", "fullname": "Communications", "id": 20}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: Name Service (DNS)", "shortname": "dns", "fullname": "Name Service (DNS)", "id": 149}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking", "shortname": "networking", "fullname": "Networking", "id": 150}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Delphi/Kylix", "shortname": "Delphi", "fullname": "Delphi/Kylix", "id": 265}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Win2K", "shortname": "mswin_2000", "fullname": "Win2K", "id": 420}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
