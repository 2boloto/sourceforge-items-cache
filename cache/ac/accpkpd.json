In practice, data often comes as Excel documents and results are reported as Power-point presentations.\r\n\r\nAccPKPDaccelerates PKPD analysis by providing fundamental software modules that significantly facilitate implementation of tailored solutions. It contains modules for representing an experiment, defining a model, simulating a model, and for parameter estimation. Furthermore, AccPKPDcompletes the full PKPD analysis work stream by supporting reading and writing data from/to Excel (Matlab built-in) and writing presentations to Power-Point.", "shortname": "accpkpd", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Accelerated analysis of routinely generated PKPD data", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 887454}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/accpkpd/", "video_url": ""}
