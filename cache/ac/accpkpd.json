In practice, data often comes as Excel documents and results are reported as Power-point presentations.\r\n\r\nAccPKPDaccelerates PKPD analysis by providing fundamental software modules that significantly facilitate implementation of tailored solutions. It contains modules for representing an experiment, defining a model, simulating a model, and for parameter estimation. Furthermore, AccPKPDcompletes the full PKPD analysis work stream by supporting reading and writing data from/to Excel (Matlab built-in) and writing presentations to Power-Point.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "accpkpd", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/petergennemark/", "username": "petergennemark", "name": "Peter Gennemark"}], "external_homepage": ""}
