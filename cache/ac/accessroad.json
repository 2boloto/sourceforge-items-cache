This includes the components, the users, the hosts and the privileges at any level.\r\nThe focus is on IT weak configurations, executing environments (malware analysis) and people authorizations. \r\n\r\nReliability and the ability to explain the results are the main objectives. A 80 pages tutorial is provided. A powerful framework allows new simulations to be added.\r\nAccess Road simulates and explains, combining complete modeling, visual results and detailed texts.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "accessroad", "_id": "506019e9fd48f8288c27a33b", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 12751, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Simulator of access controls", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "shortname": "security", "fullname": "Security", "id": 43}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Design", "shortname": "design", "fullname": "Design", "id": 582}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "id": 253}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Affero GNU Public License", "shortname": "agpl", "fullname": "Affero GNU Public License", "id": 670}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: Other API", "shortname": "db_api_other", "fullname": "Other API", "id": 509}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "id": 866}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Management", "shortname": "management", "fullname": "Management", "id": 725}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
