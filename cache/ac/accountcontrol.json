This is also included in the ZIP and again, the latest version is available here and again, can be removed but not quite so easily.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I'd be interested in receiving your feedback but note that I work for clients full-time and thus support - such as it is! - will be on a \"best endeavours\" basis.", "shortname": "accountcontrol", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "QAD access to the most common AD activities", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1312543}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/accountcontrol/", "video_url": ""}
