The function I use most often is the one to clone a user account.\r\n\r\nThe script uses a status bar \"control\" which is part of HTALite.HTC. It's included in the ZIP but the latest version should be available here but it can be stripped out easily if you don't like it. It also uses the 'overLib' scripts to display tooltips. This is also included in the ZIP and again, the latest version is available here and again, can be removed but not quite so easily.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I'd be interested in receiving your feedback but note that I work for clients full-time and thus support - such as it is! - will be on a \"best endeavours\" basis.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "accountcontrol", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/vbscab/", "username": "vbscab", "name": "VBScab"}], "external_homepage": ""}
