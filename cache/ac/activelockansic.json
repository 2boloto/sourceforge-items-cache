This project is trying to make integration as easy as possible. This version works with ActiveLock 3.5. There are still some incompatibility issues with ActiveLock 3.6. This is why I have implemented a modified version of the ActiveLock 3.5 dll that already contains routines for retrieval of the harddisk firmware number, which are included in ActiveLock 3.6. When you want to start straight away then download the package in the zip-file. When you want to have a more detailed look of how things work then get the sources through SubVersion. I will have a look at ActiveLock 3.6 compatibility in the near future and Delphi integration is on my TODO-list as well.
