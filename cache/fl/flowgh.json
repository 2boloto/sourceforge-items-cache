There are several flow cytometry software, both freeware and commercial. However, these are not open ended. They can only perform a set of statistical analysis, and can only generate a particular set of graphical output. Unfortunately, the data generated by a flow cytometer can not be read by standard data analysis software. This limitation can be overcome, if one can extract the whole or a selective data set from a flow cytometry experiment in a suitable spread sheet format (i.e. tab delimited format). FlowPy is such a tool. And more.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do using FlowPy:\r\n1. Visualize your data in 1 or 2-D (histogram or dot plot) and then select a particular region of your data set.\r\n2. For higher dimensional data, you can do clustering and then select a specific cluster.\r\n3. Extract the selected data and export to a text file or to any standard spreadsheet software.", "shortname": "flowgh", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "hi this is a flow cytometry data", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1764377}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/flowgh/", "video_url": ""}
