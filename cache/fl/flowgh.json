There are several flow cytometry software, both freeware and commercial. However, these are not open ended. They can only perform a set of statistical analysis, and can only generate a particular set of graphical output. Unfortunately, the data generated by a flow cytometer can not be read by standard data analysis software. This limitation can be overcome, if one can extract the whole or a selective data set from a flow cytometry experiment in a suitable spread sheet format (i.e. tab delimited format). FlowPy is such a tool. And more.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do using FlowPy:\r\n1. Visualize your data in 1 or 2-D (histogram or dot plot) and then select a particular region of your data set.\r\n2. For higher dimensional data, you can do clustering and then select a specific cluster.\r\n3. Extract the selected data and export to a text file or to any standard spreadsheet software.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "flowgh", "_id": "5191cccd485acd0535faccc5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1764377, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "hi this is a flow cytometry data", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
