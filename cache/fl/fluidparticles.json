In recent years various papers introduced ideas for both, the SPH simulation and its visualization. This thesis explains detailed a straightforward CPU-executed implementation of the simulation, as well as an entirely GPU-executed visualization technique using isosurface raycasting, which allows the realtime rendering of multiple refractions. Theoretical foundations and alternative techniques are presented where it seems appropriate.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fluidparticles", "_id": "5506a3ad0594ca2eeccff3e2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2427228, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Real-time SPH fluid simulation and rendering via GPU raycasting", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
