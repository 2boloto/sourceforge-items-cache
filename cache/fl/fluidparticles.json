In recent years various papers introduced ideas for both, the SPH simulation and its visualization. This thesis explains detailed a straightforward CPU-executed implementation of the simulation, as well as an entirely GPU-executed visualization technique using isosurface raycasting, which allows the realtime rendering of multiple refractions. Theoretical foundations and alternative techniques are presented where it seems appropriate.", "shortname": "fluidparticles", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Real-time SPH fluid simulation and rendering via GPU raycasting", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2427228}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fluidparticles/", "video_url": null}
