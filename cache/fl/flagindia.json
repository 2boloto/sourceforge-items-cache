This program will create attachment towards the country and I am sure it will boost BOSS installations especially on 15th August, Independance Day of India !\r\nThe gif animation is made by Dave Sutton of UK for his Indian friend. It is available on his website http://www.sevenoaksart.co.uk/india.htm as free to use. Thanks to Dave for excellent animation work !\r\nThe package contains two versions - gray and transparent background. Keep gif along with executable.\r\n\r\nYou can put executable in startup. The program uses very few resources so you can keep the flag waving without interrupting your normal work.\r\nModify and compile the source with another gif for your own country flag but I request you not to use it on any prorietary OS.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "flagindia", "_id": "556855bf0594ca112ff8104d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2470797, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Puts Waving Indian Flag On Bharat Operating System (BOSS)  desktop.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
