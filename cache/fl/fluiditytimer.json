Contributions in code, suggestions for features, and feedback on any annoyance no matter how small are encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 23rd Update:\r\n- Saves user preferences\r\n- Audio alarm has been added\r\n- Made the prelim bracket calc more accurate\r\n- Fixed the bug where \"set\" wouldn't work\r\n- Allows the user ability to set a specific default location\r\n\r\nThings to expect in the next update:\r\n- User can select other speech and debate events. This preference will be saved and treated like a default. People who only do LD won't even see this feature if they'd prefer not to.\r\n- Ability for user to select their own audio file to use as an alarm. It'll probably be limited to .wav formats until an update later\r\n- Anything you guys suggest", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fluiditytimer", "_id": "528920d30594ca3f19eb5ac3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2010114, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "A slick timer with community-tailored features.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
