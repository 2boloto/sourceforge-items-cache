Flexc++ offers a cleaner class design and requires simpler specification files than offered by  flex's C++ option.\r\n \r\n Flexc++ generates a scanner class that is ready for use, as well as a member\r\n function producing the lexical scanner tokens (lex). The class can easily\r\n be provided with additional members without resorting to polymorphic functions. \r\n\r\nConsequently, classes generated by flexc++ have no virtual members and actually have very few public members, the main one being lex(), replacing the old-style flex\r\n and flex++ yylex() function.\r\n\r\n Flexc++ offers many options, among which an option to define classes generated by flexc++ in a separate namespace. \r\n\r\nFlexc++ does not use artificial means\r\n to prevent name-collisions, like the yy-conventions used by flex and flex++ and supports very simple input-file switching mechanisms.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "flexcpp", "_id": "4f4a877ab9363c7ddb0003de", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "flexcpp", "name": "git", "label": "Flexc++"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 707898, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A C++ class scanner generator comparable to flex", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Code Generators", "shortname": "codegen", "fullname": "Code Generators", "id": 259}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
