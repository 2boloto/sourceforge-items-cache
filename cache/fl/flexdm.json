WEKA is a machine learning package designed to facilitate this task by providing tools that allow researchers to select from a plethora of classification methods and specific test strategies. Despite its popularity, the current WEKA Experimenter, has limitations that impact its usability: lack of flexibility for parameter ranges;  no multi-core parallelisation; results are not saved until the last test has concluded; and the XML schema is difficult to read. FlexDM implements an interface with WEKA to run batch processing tasks in a simple and intuitive way. In an XML file hundreds of tests can be defined to run on several datasets. FlexDM allows those tests to be executed in parallel to take advantage of multi-core processors, significantly increasing usability. Results are saved incrementally for better robustness and reliability.", "shortname": "flexdm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Flexible Data Mining using WEKA", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2332040}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/flexdm/", "video_url": null}
