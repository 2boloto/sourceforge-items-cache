The user needs to remember only her master password to recover other passwords. Passwords are always regenerated on-the-fly from the given login data when needed and are never saved. In other words, Fleeting Password Manager combines the password creation and management. The length of the generated password is configurable between 8 and 32 characters and Fleeting Password Manager can remember wanted URL/User-pairs. \r\n\r\nThe newest source code and relases here: https://github.com/juzzlin/FleetingPasswordManager/releases", "shortname": "fleetingpm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "moved", "summary": "Fleeting Password Manager generates and manages passwords.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 547708}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fleetingpm/", "video_url": null}
