A person viewing the animated flipping should very easily be able to spot  differences between the images. The approach has been very successfully to image-related tasks in astronomy and medicine. Accurate image alignment is the cornerstone to effective flicker chronoscopy, and it is the the most challenging part of the process as well.\r\n\r\nHugin is an open-source project dedicated to building robust panaromic software. A subset of that effort is image alignment, but the Hugin interface is not optimized for very fast, simple flicker chronoscopy. Flicker Chronoscopy (this program) is a simple user interface that overlays Hugin's image alignment software (align_image_stack.exe) for the purposes of making flicker chronoscopy fast and easy.", "shortname": "flickerchronoscopy", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Free Software for Performing Flicker Chronoscopy", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2245623}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/flickerchronoscopy/", "video_url": null}
