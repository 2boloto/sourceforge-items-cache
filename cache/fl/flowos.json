FlowOS is a Linux kernel module-based system that captures IP packets for a flow (defined using OpenFlow primitives) and constructs one or more virtual byte streams to be processed by flow processing modules. Flow processing modules are also kernel modules that run as independent kernel threads and process data of specific streams. FlowOS provides a set of high-level APIs to write flow processing modules like writing a socket application. Programmers see a flow as a specific application byte stream and do not need to handle low-level packet processing. \r\n\r\nBeyond the extraction of streams from flows, FlowOS itself does not process flows but allows separate flow processing modules to process a flow. FlowOS supports the concept of processing pipeline, that is, a sequence of processing stages, where at each stage one or more PMs can process the flow concurrently.
