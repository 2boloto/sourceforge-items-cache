It is in VERY early stages (0.0.1) and currently comes with Wine and Playonlinux, and some other non gaming related stuff. I am hoping to add more software eventually. I will be constantly updating until I get to version 1.0. Then monthly releases. After version 15, I will discontinue the project, I wont bring the download link down. I am not a huge linux nerd yet. So if there is anything essential I missed, please tell me. Also, I am not currently sure if people are capable of installing it yet. It is in early pre-alpha, so give me some feedback. Before you say it absolutely sucks. I am a geek, just new to Linux. Once I find out how stuff works in making a linux distro, I will attempt to make this a good OS overall. (Note: I may discontinue before version 15, version 15 is just my plan.
