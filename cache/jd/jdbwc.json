Suited to Java applications that require JDBC access across wide area networks like the internet but do not wish to expose the remote database-server through the remote hosts firewall.\r\n\r\nThe driver is well suited for connecting Java client applications to a (dynamic) websites database without risking the security of the database server since all exchanges use PHP as a relay agent. Java client applications can connect from dynamic or static IP's safely using the SSL protocol (plaintext is also supported).\r\n\r\nTo help optimize network connection usage, SELECT queries sent as a batch CAN be returned in a single pass. The additional resultsets are accessed using the standard JDBC Statement.getMoreResults() to iterate and Statement.getResultSet() to consume each additional Resultset in the results. This feature can help improve client application performance when running multiple select queries in a row.", "shortname": "jdbwc", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "JDBC Network Driver", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 233279}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jdbwc/", "video_url": ""}
