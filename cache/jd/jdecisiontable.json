First of all they present the\r\nlogic in a very dense form.\r\n\r\n 1. Explore all possible combinations of conditions and actions by question-and-answer.\r\n\r\n 2. Have a compact one-sheet-view on complex logic.\r\n\r\n 3. Have abandoned combinations documented.\r\n\r\n 4. Make sure that your decision table is (formally) neither incomplete nor inconsistent\r\n    with one click. And the mathematics behind it is very easy and well documented ;-)\r\n\r\n 5. Get the test cases necessary to test your piece of logic with one click.\r\n\r\n 6. Other than in traditional decision tables, you can mix conditions and actions.\r\n\r\n=> Stop to to rack your brain - start using process-oriented decision tables! <=", "shortname": "jdecisiontable", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Stop to rack your brain, start using process-oriented decision tables!", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 643171}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jdecisiontable/", "video_url": null}
