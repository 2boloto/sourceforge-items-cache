First of all they present the\r\nlogic in a very dense form.\r\n\r\n 1. Explore all possible combinations of conditions and actions by question-and-answer.\r\n\r\n 2. Have a compact one-sheet-view on complex logic.\r\n\r\n 3. Have abandoned combinations documented.\r\n\r\n 4. Make sure that your decision table is (formally) neither incomplete nor inconsistent\r\n    with one click. And the mathematics behind it is very easy and well documented ;-)\r\n\r\n 5. Get the test cases necessary to test your piece of logic with one click.\r\n\r\n 6. Other than in traditional decision tables, you can mix conditions and actions.\r\n\r\n=> Stop to to rack your brain - start using process-oriented decision tables! <=", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jdecisiontable", "_id": "4edd40790594ca547a001166", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 643171, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "Stop to rack your brain, start using process-oriented decision tables!", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Quality Assurance", "shortname": "quality_assurance", "fullname": "Quality Assurance", "id": 565}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Information Analysis", "shortname": "informationanalysis", "fullname": "Information Analysis", "id": 385}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "id": 537}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: German", "shortname": "german", "fullname": "German", "id": 279}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
