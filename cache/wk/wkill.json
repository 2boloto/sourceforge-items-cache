It uses solely the Windows API and is written in Win32 assembly (FASM). \r\n\r\nFASM is an abbrevation for \"flat assembler\". For more information see here http://flatassembler.net/.\r\n\r\nAfter launching wkill the mouse pointer changes to the red wkill icon. Clicking on any window will terminate the process that created it and will also exit wkill. \r\n\r\nAnother way to use wkill is to either click the middle mouse button or move the scroll wheel up or down once. This will change the mouse pointer to the red wkill icon but with a plus sign. This signifies 'sticky' mode. Clicking on any window will terminate its process but wkill will remain running and more windows can be targetted. \r\n\r\nClicking on the middle mouse button or moving the scroll wheel up or down one more time will change the pointer to a green X icon. Clicking anywhere will exit wkill.\r\n\r\nRight clicking anywhere at any time will also exit wkill.", "shortname": "wkill", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Windows utility which terminates a targeted window or program.", "tools": [{"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1901740}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wkill/", "video_url": ""}
