At its core, QASM-P relies on simulation of stabilizer states, based on the CHP code by Aaronson and Gottesman (Phys. Rev. A 70, 052328 (2004)), and used by Andrew Cross in the original QASM implementation. QASM-P extends the original QASM capabilities in two main respects:\r\n\r\nWe incorporate a number of state of the art approaches for analysis of QEC circuits that are drawn from the literature, which are now implemented together in a unified software package.\r\n\r\nWe introduce new QEC circuit specification mechanisms, implement a uniform mechanism to allow different physical machine characteristics (e.g. physical error rates), a method to determine the optimal size of post-selected ancilla created in parallel, and provide support for data aggregation of results from multiple Monte Carlo and malignant pair simulation runs.\r\n", "summary": "QASM-P is  a QEC extension of the QASM simulation platform.
