It's designed to serve as a building block for other tools and libraries such as linters, validators, templating languages, and refactoring and analysis tools.\r\n\r\nGoals & features:\r\n\r\nFully conformant with the HTML5 spec.\r\nRobust and resilient to bad input.\r\nSimple API that can be easily wrapped by other languages.\r\nSupport for source locations and pointers back to the original text.\r\nSupport for fragment parsing.\r\nRelatively lightweight, with no outside dependencies.\r\nPasses all html5lib tests, including the template tag.\r\nTested on over 2.5 billion pages from Google's index.\r\nNon-goals:\r\n\r\nExecution speed. Gumbo gains some of this by virtue of being written in C, but it is not an important consideration for the intended use-case, and was not a major design factor.\r\nSupport for encodings other than UTF-8. For the most part, client code can convert the input stream ", "shortname": "gumbo-parser", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A pure-C HTML5 parser from Google.", "tools": [{"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2438701}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gumbo-parser/", "video_url": null}
