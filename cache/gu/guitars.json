GUItars uses SSMD for hit selection, which is preferred for its ability to diminish sample size effects and the false hit rate, making it superior to other widely used HTS analysis methods. The program can handle the analysis for screens without replicates as well as with replicates. For comparison purposes,  non-SSMD-based methods such as percent activity, z-score, and t-test are also provided as scoring options.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1 released: several bugs fixed.\r\nVersion 3.0 released for Windows and Mac: experiment-wise analysis option, map to all samples option (no hit cut-off needed), percent activity for replicates option and .ai output format are added", "shortname": "guitars", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "GUItars is designed for the analysis of high throughput RNAi data.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 786538}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/guitars/", "video_url": null}
