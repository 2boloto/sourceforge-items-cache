The goal of the program is to prank your friends into downloading the software, which, when run, pretends to scan their system for viruses.  It then prompts for administrator username and password, and once entered, saves them to a text file called 'userpass'.  It then pretends to fully detect and clear all of the viruses.\r\n\r\nHOW TO RUN:\r\nYou must have Python 2.7.6 installed in order to run this software.  In order to run it, go to a command prompt in Windows or open a Terminal in Mac or Linux and type 'python ffpvs' to run it.\r\n\r\nWARNING:\r\nThis is NOT a real virus scanner and please do not use it as such.  It is meant for pranking/trolling ONLY.  I claim NO LIABILITY for stolen passwords/hacking gathered using this tool.\r\n\r\nTROUBLESHOOTING:\r\nSaving it as a .py file might help, also, make sure you have Python 2.7.6 installed.", "shortname": "ffpvs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Flying Fast Python Virus Scanner", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2108306}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ffpvs/", "video_url": null}
