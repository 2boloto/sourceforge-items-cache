Why a fork?\r\nThe reason for the fork is to address a need for use cases which conflict with one of RE2's central missions, which is to be lightweight.  DFAlib's API's will change to reflect the needs of use cases which require  features that have been rejected at RE2. DFAlib retains the New BSD license of RE2 and credit the original authors of RE2 as forming the basis of this new project. The central innovation DFAlib will carry forward from RE2 is the ability to use a DFA to capture a regular expression match. That is a long needed innovation in open source regular expression libraries. This project has started as an exact clone of RE2 but new features and behaviors will be added quickly.", "shortname": "dfalib", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A DFA capable Regular Expression Library", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 750949}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dfalib/", "video_url": ""}
