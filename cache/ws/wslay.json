It implements the protocol version 13 described in RFC 6455. This library offers 2 levels of API: event-based API and frame-based low-level API. For event-based API, it is suitable for non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set callbacks in various events. For frame-based API, you can send WebSocket frame directly. Wslay only supports data transfer part of WebSocket protocol and does not perform opening handshake in HTTP. Wslay does not perform any I/O operations for its own. Instead, it offers callbacks for them. This makes Wslay independent on any I/O frameworks, SSL, sockets, etc.  This makes Wslay protable across various platforms and the application authors can choose freely I/O frameworks.\r\n", "shortname": "wslay", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "WebSocket library written in C.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 663473}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "link", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wslay/", "video_url": ""}
