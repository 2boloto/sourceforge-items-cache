It implements the protocol version 13 described in RFC 6455. This library offers 2 levels of API: event-based API and frame-based low-level API. For event-based API, it is suitable for non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set callbacks in various events. For frame-based API, you can send WebSocket frame directly. Wslay only supports data transfer part of WebSocket protocol and does not perform opening handshake in HTTP. Wslay does not perform any I/O operations for its own. Instead, it offers callbacks for them. This makes Wslay independent on any I/O frameworks, SSL, sockets, etc.  This makes Wslay protable across various platforms and the application authors can choose freely I/O frameworks.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wslay", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/t-tujikawa/", "username": "t-tujikawa", "name": "tujikawa"}], "external_homepage": "http://wslay.sourceforge.net/"}
