By utilizing the full features of Jython, list comprehension, object orientation, unit testing the library provides a scalable and robust set of tools. The project also follows the principles of ITIL configuration management, providing tools to detect and manage configuration drift such as where an operator makes changes through the Administrative console but fails to update the documentation.  The sample properties files for builds are xml extracts from the original WebSphere configuration files and can be used in their raw format or processed with a style sheet for human audiences.  By eliminating the separation of documentation and properties files, the tool effectively updates your documentation. Use of CVS is encouraged to ensure that properties files are treated as configuration artifacts rather than updated in an non managed manner.", "shortname": "wsdeploy", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "WebSphere wsadmin Jython Scripts", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 691363}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wsdeploy/", "video_url": ""}
