Energy aware routing algorithms can be used to increase the energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks.  Today, two common kinds of energy aware routing algorithms are being researched and implemented in wireless networks.  The first type main type is known as Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), which aggregates the network into clusters and randomly rotates the base station inside the cluster to evenly distribute the workload. LEACH elongates the lifetime of a wireless network twice as long as the one without an energy aware routing algorithm. This project focuses on Mica-Z wireless networks for military and commercial applications, and also presents a framework for software technology for sensors.", "shortname": "xmesh", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Implementing Xmesh using TinyOS", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 630109}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/xmesh/", "video_url": ""}
