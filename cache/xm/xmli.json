Data can be written to your program variables or pointers. \r\n\r\nXMLi2 provides an XML-based scripting language that makes XML generation easy. Simply write a template of your desired XML/HTML and use imbedded SQL queries to build your data. Pass parameters to the template from your RPG to be used in your SQL queries. Conditional logic is provided by IF and CHOOSE blocks, and looping constructs are provided by DOW/DOU/FOR loops. Looping through SQL queries is provided using FOR-EACH. Data can be written to the IFS, standard output, or passed to a call-back procedure.\r\n\r\nExtend the XMLi language via your own extensions written in RPG. These allow you to call your own business logic from within a running template.\r\n\r\n100% ILE RPG - source available in download, and at SVN repository.\r\n\r\nRuns on IBM i (iSeries, Series, AS/400)", "shortname": "xmli", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Easy XML generation in ILE RPG", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 269186}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/xmli/", "video_url": ""}
