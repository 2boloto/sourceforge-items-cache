Given Musk/Tesla have not done this on their own, I felt the need to do this in order to make sure that the buzz around the project is not lost, and that those excited about the project can join and contribute their ideas in an organized fashion.\r\n\r\nIf Musk or Tesla would like to take control of the project, I would be more than happy to hand over the project to their staff.  As of now, I felt it necessary to capture the energy and drive behind the project.  Please contact me if you'd like to share admin on the site, especially if you have extensive professional experience with CM/Source Control/Sourceforge.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hyperloopcollaboration", "_id": "52095cc024b0d95018496e39", "tools": [{"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1930049, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "A page for everyone to collaborate on Musks Hyperloop Concept", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
