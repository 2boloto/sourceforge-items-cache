However, we have yet to bear witness to a user orienting, moving, and interacting in a space with other users where they have audiovisual and haptic feedback regarding conditions across eight cardinal directions instead of just six. Hyperland is a simulation platform designed to address the extent to which human users are capable of perceiving and operating in a geometrically accurate representation of four spatial dimensions.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the two-stage plan is to develop a simulation of:\r\n\r\n    1. 4D Euclidean space as proof-of-concept\r\n    2. Minkowski spacetime with four spatial dimensions to include relativistic effects\r\n\r\nFor more background and information, please visit the Hyperland node on the Open Science Framework:\r\nhttps://openscienceframework.org/project/dXJEO/wiki/home\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hyperland", "_id": "526a7f5eea406b0e3d6570f4", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1989591, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "Simulation platform: four spatial dimensions w/many users and objects.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Simulations", "shortname": "simulations", "fullname": "Simulations", "id": 600}], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
