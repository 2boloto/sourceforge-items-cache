However, we have yet to bear witness to a user orienting, moving, and interacting in a space with other users where they have audiovisual and haptic feedback regarding conditions across eight cardinal directions instead of just six. Hyperland is a simulation platform designed to address the extent to which human users are capable of perceiving and operating in a geometrically accurate representation of four spatial dimensions.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the two-stage plan is to develop a simulation of:\r\n\r\n    1. 4D Euclidean space as proof-of-concept\r\n    2. Minkowski spacetime with four spatial dimensions to include relativistic effects\r\n\r\nFor more background and information, please visit the Hyperland node on the Open Science Framework:\r\nhttps://openscienceframework.org/project/dXJEO/wiki/home\r\n", "shortname": "hyperland", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simulation platform: four spatial dimensions w/many users and objects.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1989591}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/hyperland/", "video_url": ""}
