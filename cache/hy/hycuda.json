When set up, you can switch between devices to execute part of the algorithm without having to worry about memory transfers. Based on a specification file that describes some properties of the algorithm, HyCuda generates C++11 header- and sourcefiles, only a few of which have to be modified by the programmer in order to implement the algorithm itself. \r\n\r\nThe generated code contains a lot of template metaprogramming (TMP), to make sure the decision for an algorithm to run on the CPU or GPU has already been made at compile-time. The same holds for the decisions whether or not to transfer data. This amounts to 0 runtime overhead.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hycuda", "_id": "52b18cf1a02bb176a1a63e6b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2053065, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Hybrid Framework Generator for CUDA", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
