It uses libSDL as its backend for graphical output. \r\nThis library can be used in both dynamic multimedia (game), and standard  (static) applications. The HyperGUI manages it by avoiding screen refreshes as much as possible. In a game or other dynamic multimedia program, the screen (or part of it) is redrawn and refreshed tens of times a second, so there is no need for GUI to ask more refreshes in response of input events; and in a static application each event may change a tiny part of the screen, and only that part needs redrawing. HyperGUI has the flexibility to work in both states.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hypergui", "_id": "52a4be1b0594ca06acf91ee4", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2037834, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "A GUI based on libSDL for C++ applications", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: User Interfaces", "shortname": "softwaredev_ui", "fullname": "User Interfaces", "id": 561}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics", "shortname": "graphics", "fullname": "Graphics", "id": 100}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: SDL", "shortname": "ui_sdl", "fullname": "SDL", "id": 480}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: Persian", "shortname": "persian", "fullname": "Persian", "id": 343}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "shortname": "mingw_msys", "fullname": "MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "id": 445}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
