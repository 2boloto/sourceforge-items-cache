For now, gotta open the craft with a text editor, identify which part you need to be root and count them.\r\n\r\nTo help you, you gotta know that a part starts with a \r\n\r\nPART\r\n{\r\n\r\nand soon there's a line that says partName = (something) which gives you a very good clue.\r\n\r\nThis is a very first working version and there's zero error tolerance. Backup your file (though it should be untouched).\r\n\r\nAll corrections and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to fork or translate this to c# to build a KSP mod!
