Normally the Linux version of FCE Ultra is command line only, and I couldn't find a .deb or \"ready to go\" version of the graphical frontend to FCEUX that didn't require me to compile source code(Dependency hell isn't worth trying to compile source code any more).  This aims to provide key functionality such as selecting a game and passing some default arguments without requiring you to run the commands manually every time.  My primary goal was to create a simple, easy to access and easy to use front-end to the novice user who just wants to click an icon and start playing their games without worrying about compiling source code and downloading/compiling missing dependencies, etc.  FCE Ultra is not included with this download so make sure you install it yourself.  This is just a front-end.", "shortname": "fceubash", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A Bash Front-End to FCE Ultra", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 674339}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fceubash/", "video_url": ""}
