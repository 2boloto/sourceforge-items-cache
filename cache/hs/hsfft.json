It is designed to give good performance for non-power of length 2 FFTs. Only 1D , unit-stride implementation for singe core processors available as of now.\r\nUSAGE\r\n\r\nHSFFT is designed specifically to handle time series data efficiently. The software is structured very similarly to available open source softwares like FFTW and kissfft. The data structure is almost identical to Mark Borgerding's kissfft implementaion. However, this implementation is lightweight compared to FFTW and should give better performance for non-power of two implementations compared to kissfft in a single core setting. The project is a work in progress and the To-Do list is considerably long, including an implementation with multicore/multithread support, real FFT support, multi-stride and multi-dimensional FFTs. \r\n\r\nDocumentation Wiki - https://github.com/rafat/hsfft/wiki", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hsfft", "_id": "51b258d5485acd68d9e8be80", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1865217, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "FFT and Convolution in C", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
