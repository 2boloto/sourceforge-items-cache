In some situations is important to let that a set of jobs run in series without human supervision. This allows you to exploit the computing resources available on your machine, in order to keep the machine working all the time. The principal problem is that the available queue systems are a bit complicated to install or simply you need to be root to install it and you don't have those permissions. SJobQ is the solution, because, you don't need to be root and to install it you need download three files only and go !, you can begin to work.", "shortname": "sjobq", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "very simple queue system", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1279946}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sjobq/", "video_url": ""}
