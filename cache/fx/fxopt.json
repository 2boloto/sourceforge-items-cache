There are several optional types of optimization that may be enabled by the user to improve accuracy at the expense of larger executable code size and greater execution time. The output of this process includes a standard gcc object file and a detailed transcript showing how the conversion was done. It is also possible to produce a C version of the resulting function that exactly reproduces the behavior of the compiled function.\r\n\r\nThe primary target processor for this work is the ARM Cortex-M but there is no inherent requirement to target any specific architecture.\r\n\r\nThis work is part of a research project and is likely to undergo frequent revision.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fxopt", "_id": "52572d28ea406b1ca1dc4c08", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1976613, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "fixed-point arithmetic plugin for gcc", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
