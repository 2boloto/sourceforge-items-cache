We have standardized data to match for any currency by the difference of Close Price and Open Price. If the value of the candlestick is negative we recognize it as Bearish or Downward if the value of the difference is positive we recognize the candlestick as Bullish or Upward.\r\nFxForecast can forecast from 1 minute chart to 1 hour chart as we are updating the software in our upcoming version. Results are all based on historical data but it is your stake to make final decision. Watch out for upcoming news for more accurate decision. FxForecast works fine normally or low weighed news but for news making high difference in currency value better watchout for that.
