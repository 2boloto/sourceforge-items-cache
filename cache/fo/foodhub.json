At the start of an ordering cycle, suppliers update their products.  Customers may then log in, choose a collection day and location, and add goods to their baskets.  Once the customer submits an order, they receive an email invoice.  Payment is made on collection.\r\n\r\nThe system supports cycles of arbitrary length (for example: weekly, fortnightly), multiple collection days and locations per cycle, and veg and fruit boxes in addition to individual goods.\r\n\r\nThe system provides reports for suppliers, and for collection day activities such as packing boxes and receiving payment.  Customers can receive credits and refunds between cycles.\r\n\r\nCommunity Food Hub uses PHP (up to 5.3) with a MySQL database.  It is based on the Local Food Coop software (http://sourceforge.net/projects/foodcoop), with support for box schemes in the UK.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "foodhub", "_id": "511662e21be1ce16f78a1076", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1275069, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "Web ordering system for community food coops and veg box schemes", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: E-Commerce / Shopping", "shortname": "ecommerce", "fullname": "E-Commerce / Shopping", "id": 654}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "shortname": "php", "fullname": "PHP", "id": 183}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "fullname": "SQL-based", "id": 508}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Non-Profit Organizations", "shortname": "nonprofit", "fullname": "Non-Profit Organizations", "id": 618}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Agriculture", "shortname": "agriculture", "fullname": "Agriculture", "id": 765}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
