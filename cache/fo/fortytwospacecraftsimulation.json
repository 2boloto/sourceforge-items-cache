Its primary purpose is to support design and validation of attitude control systems, from concept studies through integration and test.  42 accurately models multi-body spacecraft attitude dynamics (with rigid and/or flexible bodies), and both two-body and three-body orbital flight regimes, modelling environments from low Earth orbit to throughout the solar system.  42 simulates multiple spacecraft concurrently, facilitating studies of rendezvous, proximity operations, and precision formation flying.  It also features visualization of spacecraft attitude.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fortytwospacecraftsimulation", "_id": "5500858a85540d0c47c825f7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2424063, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}], "summary": "Simulation for spacecraft attitude control system analysis and design", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Simulations", "shortname": "simulations", "fullname": "Simulations", "id": 600}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization", "shortname": "visualization", "fullname": "Visualization", "id": 135}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: NASA Open Source Agreement", "shortname": "nasalicense", "fullname": "NASA Open Source Agreement", "id": 407}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: OpenGL", "shortname": "ui_opengl", "fullname": "OpenGL", "id": 475}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Aerospace", "shortname": "aerospace", "fullname": "Aerospace", "id": 599}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "shortname": "mingw_msys", "fullname": "MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "id": 445}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}]}}
