The user gets into the system using his/her username and password. Each user has to make an account for himself in the beginning. His account information will be stored on the server machine in persistent form. Server sessions will have no effect on its accounts. \r\nThe server can be running anywhere on the network. The players play in a virtual environment among walls and obstacles (walls are porous, beware!). The shots fired at an opponent within range will cause him to lose 'life' points. The target is to kill maximum number of opponents. Once a player is killed he is logged out and then may reenter. At the end a scorecard showing the number of logins and the number of kills of all players of the current session is displayed at each terminal.\r\nI have used fairly basic models, animations and a simple map.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "force4magixgame", "_id": "502344aeb9363c6b318cdc3b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 846812, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A multiplayer First-Person-Shooter game built in Java 3D", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: First Person Shooters", "shortname": "firstpersonshooters", "fullname": "First Person Shooters", "id": 82}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Multiplayer", "shortname": "multiplayer", "fullname": "Multiplayer", "id": 774}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Real Time Tactical", "shortname": "realtimetactical", "fullname": "Real Time Tactical", "id": 847}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: Flat-file", "shortname": "db_file_flat", "fullname": "Flat-file", "id": 521}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: OpenGL", "shortname": "ui_opengl", "fullname": "OpenGL", "id": 475}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "id": 537}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
