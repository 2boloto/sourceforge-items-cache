His account information will be stored on the server machine in persistent form. Server sessions will have no effect on its accounts. \r\nThe server can be running anywhere on the network. The players play in a virtual environment among walls and obstacles (walls are porous, beware!). The shots fired at an opponent within range will cause him to lose 'life' points. The target is to kill maximum number of opponents. Once a player is killed he is logged out and then may reenter. At the end a scorecard showing the number of logins and the number of kills of all players of the current session is displayed at each terminal.\r\nI have used fairly basic models, animations and a simple map.", "shortname": "force4magixgame", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A multiplayer First-Person-Shooter game built in Java 3D", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 846812}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/force4magixgame/", "video_url": ""}
