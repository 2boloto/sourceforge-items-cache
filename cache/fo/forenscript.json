Script is a program used to record all input and output that is entered into the terminal windows that script is executed in. This saves you time by automatically creating records of everything you do in that terminal. The issue is that the output of script is a plaintext \u201ctypescript\u201d file that can be very hard to read, and gets harder to read as the file size increases.\r\n\r\n\tForenscript aims to solve this problem by providing the user with a front-end that makes navigating and parsing the script output file easier, while also allowing users to export only important contents to a new file for future use.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "forenscript", "_id": "508dacd31be1ce6b10464d53", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1046987, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "A parsing utility for the \"Script\" command", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
