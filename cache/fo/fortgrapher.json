It allows you to divide you data into groups of datafiles and each group is stored on its own directory. It allows you to create different types of plotting files such as, PNG file for each datafile and PDF and MPEG files for each group of datafiles. It works with FORMATTED and UNFORMATTED fortran datafiles.\r\nWhen you call the main subroutine in this module which is called FORTPLOT, it creates a python coded file that you can execute it at any time to get the plots and take a decision about continue the run or halt it. So, with multiple nodes machine you can assign a node for running the python coded file created by the Fortran code to get you data plotted.", "shortname": "fortgrapher", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "InLine Plot with Fortran", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 789377}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fortgrapher/", "video_url": ""}
