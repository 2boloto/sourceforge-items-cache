The toolbox allows acquiring FOod-Related subject Characteristics in a standardized manner.  \r\n\r\nThe FORC platform includes three components, the FORC Toolbox, the Questionnaire Processor and the Test Battery. The FORC Toolbox serves as a front-end for the open-source experiment builder OpenSesame. With the FORC Toolbox you can easily generate, select, combine and run multiple existing questionnaires and tasks. The FORC Toolbox comes with a Test Battery of questionnaires and tasks to measure food-related subject characteristics. The Questionnaire Processor can be used to process the log-files with raw data that are produced by the FORC Toolbox. \r\n\r\nThe FORC platform was developed within the Nudge-It project.
