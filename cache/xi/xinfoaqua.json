If there is anyone that want to code on it let me know and i will add to the list so you can upload to here.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2012-07-03\r\nI have a mac at home again, and i have seen that the new Ivy Bridge intels do make some problems with the script, so i will start to work on the cpu detection part of the script some more.\r\n\r\nI will also see if i can bundle it with XChat Azure insted of the old XChat Aqua i have now.
