I dont have a Mac to code on at the moment. If there is anyone that want to code on it let me know and i will add to the list so you can upload to here.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2012-07-03\r\nI have a mac at home again, and i have seen that the new Ivy Bridge intels do make some problems with the script, so i will start to work on the cpu detection part of the script some more.\r\n\r\nI will also see if i can bundle it with XChat Azure insted of the old XChat Aqua i have now. Or if they are willing to bundle the script in that insted. But the first part will be to get CPU Detection back on track.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xinfoaqua", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mushishi/", "username": "mushishi", "name": "Mushishi"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bizkut-limau/", "username": "bizkut-limau", "name": "Hasanuddin Abu Bakar"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/prasys/", "username": "prasys", "name": "Pradeesh"}], "external_homepage": "http://xinfoaqua.sourceforge.net"}
