Four board files are included.  Two are based on regional variations of Monopoly but with places named after colours instead, the other two are there more to demonstrate what can be done.\r\n\r\nHopefully there are no major bugs in the game - I cannot guarantee that there are none, but I've done some testing on Linux and Windows systems and with some luck have more or less ironed out the worst bugs that would affect the game on either system.  I have no idea how well this game runs on other operating systems, but then again I can't see much in theory to stop it working on any operating system capable of running java..", "shortname": "kludgopolb", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 754484}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kludgopolb/", "video_url": ""}
