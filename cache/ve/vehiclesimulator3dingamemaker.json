Camera control and vehicle control are implemented with great care. This program serves as a reference material and reliable example for 2 tasks in 3D videogames:\r\n*hilly terrain as basis of game's environment\r\n*vehicles realistically drivable on hilly terrain.\r\n\r\nThe package contains the Windows (XP or campatible) executable, and the folder with the Game Maker project. Hope it will be useful for some. This project actually houses 2 zip packages...1 is a full-blown driving simulator, called Tractor Nerd 3D, and a sample program which implements a simple game in which the player controls a hero which can walk on a hilly terrain, where this terrain is defined throught a hightmap read froam an external bitmap image file and another bitmap which, according to some conventions,defines which texture is to be put at which little 'square' of the terrain, and a folder contraining the textures\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vehiclesimulator3dingamemaker", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ctrucker/", "username": "ctrucker", "name": "Simon Hasur"}], "external_homepage": null}
