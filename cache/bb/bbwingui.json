As I am a old Linux guy using a text editor to configure the BBWin.cfg file was common place. When I had to teach others to, not only edit but troubleshoot the files when  mistakes were made. That became a task in and of its self. BBWin GUI makes easy work of installing the latest BBWin application, setting for the first time or updating and active system. This app even saves you having to open up notepad first as a admin in Windows 2008 servers before editing and saving the BBWin.cfg file.\r\n", "summary": "GUI Frontend to BBWin XYmon Monitoring Agent", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 739632, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bbwingui", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/x-beatnic/", "username": "x-beatnic", "name": "S Anderson"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/about-BBWinGUI.gif", "caption": "About", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/about-BBWinGUI.gif/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp3.png", "caption": "CPU", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp3.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp4.png", "caption": "Memory", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp4.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp5.png", "caption": "Disk", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp5.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp6.png", "caption": "Services", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp6.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp7.png", "caption": "Procs", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bbwingui/screenshot/BBWinApp7.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.squidworks.net/bbwingui", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "id": 230}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "fullname": "C#", "shortname": "csharp", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking :: Monitoring", "fullname": "Monitoring", "shortname": "monitoring", "id": 152}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
