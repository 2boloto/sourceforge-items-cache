The basic concept of the project is to build a large social network site that will promote talent of any kind. People with talent can join the site and showcase their talent through a special page for them with their unique look and design. People all around the world can join the network and use it. When some one or some agency want to search for talented people they can just use this site and contact the person. For example a restaurant in the US wants some people with knowledge of Chinese Food than they can search for the right person and contact him/her. This would be a rapidly growing company with millions of people visiting it.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask all the people interested in it to join the team and lets start the job.", "shortname": "talentshowcase", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A open source social network site to showcase talent that people have.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 831613}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/talentshowcase/", "video_url": ""}
