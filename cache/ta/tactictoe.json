Wherever player one goes on the small board, player two has to move in on the grid of boards (and vice versa). For example, if player one moves in the top left square on the center board, player two has to move on the top left board. If that board has already been won or filled, player two can move wherever they want. The game is won when one of the players has won three boards in a row.", "shortname": "tactictoe", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A variant of tictactoe that requires strategy and forward thinking", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 741079}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tactictoe/", "video_url": ""}
