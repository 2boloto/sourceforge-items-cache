Additional programs will be installed (on HDD, or USB stick) using the LES scripts and its additional files which can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxefficiencyscripts/files/ It is btw possible to put the scripts and files on the CD, HDD or USB stick, by just copying in the files after having made a bootable media, using the TAZ iso\r\n\r\nOther main differences from slitaz will be the use of mdev (instead of udev, used by slitaz), the ability to boot using xvesa directly from the boot menu, no many-in-1-flavor iso's, ...", "shortname": "taz", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A fork of the slitaz linux distribution", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2457856}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/taz/", "video_url": null}
