Generally, like-minded groups of people will get together and participate in one-on-one matches or regularly organized tournaments.\r\n    Social media already has scoring and ranking programs, but they tend to be themed for certain sports, activities, and interests. Many of those have long-standing out-moded ranking and ratings systems in place.\r\n    TARStack will change this trend by using a standard ranking formula: The \u201cK-simplified\u201d chess ranking formula (provisional USCF version). This will ensure friendly competition can remain friendly without large discrepancies in the results between even matches with a clear victor.", "shortname": "tarstack", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Tournaments and Ratings Stack", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 761394}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tarstack/", "video_url": ""}
