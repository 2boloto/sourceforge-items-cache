You can select the stuff, either by using the button provided, or type the stuff path yourself.\r\n\r\nIt also support Drag-and-Drop, which allows you to pin a bunch of stuff at once.\r\n\r\n\"Set Before You Pin\" is the concept of this app. You can customize how your shortcut will be, such as its icon, before you pin it to taskbar.\r\n\r\nIt also support any language version of Windows, as it uses Unicode version of API, and it loads the verb string  (such as \"Pin to Taskbar\") from Shell32.dll at Runtime.\r\n\r\nBesides that, it's also light and portable, as it's only a exe file. At here, I wanted to thank Mattias Sj\u00f6gren \r\nfor his ShellLinkNative.vb and ShellShortcut.vb. Without his classes, this project will never work without dll.\r\n\r\nHope you guys will like it. :-D", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "taskbarpinner", "_id": "5157e27004161f33663fae31", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1451892, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Pin ANY stuff to the Win7/8 taskbar.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Desktop Environment", "shortname": "desktop", "fullname": "Desktop Environment", "id": 55}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: System Shells", "shortname": "shells", "fullname": "System Shells", "id": 294}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Visual Basic .NET", "shortname": "vb_net", "fullname": "Visual Basic .NET", "id": 453}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
