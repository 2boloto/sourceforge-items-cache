This helps in boosting all applications based on metatranscriptomic assembly. Original assemblies should be based on De Bruijn graphs created by Oases. Auxiliary scripts that help reporting statistics about all kinds of assemblies are also integrated with the pipeline.\r\n\r\nExperimental results show that DNPipe improves the precision against ref-based GOLD standard while\r\n\ffiltering out thousands of transcripts. Each original assembly was made up of 20000+ transcripts. High precision of filtered assemblies and considerably short execution time (16 to 20 minutes) of the pipeline makes it a desirable postprocessing step of de novo assemblies.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the execution of the pipeline, please refer to DNPipe_Manual.pdf (in Files/).\r\n\r\nFor inquiries, please contact us at hmohsen@indiana.edu.", "shortname": "dnpipe", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A machine learning pipeline to improve de novo assemblies", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2455968}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dnpipe/", "video_url": null}
