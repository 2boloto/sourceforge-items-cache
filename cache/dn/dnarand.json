I started writing it for learning the basics of programming and Python language, using it as a gym for the language features that I wanted to learn. It turned out to be a highly customizable DNA sequences writer: it can be used to produce random sequences to be used as reference to test a pattern of choice against the appearance of random patterns, or to look at the features of the open reading frames that spontaneously pop up. Plus, it's possible to tell dnarand which is our favorite GC ratio, so that it can simulate AT-rich or GC-rich genomes, and choose our favorite genetic code from all available Ncbi's ones.\r\nI'm actively adding new features.", "shortname": "dnarand", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "dnarand is a highly customizable DNA sequences writer", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2258249}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dnarand/", "video_url": null}
