Basically it works by sniffing out DNS requests and then spoofing packets to look like it came from the NS. So far it can sniff and inject correctly spoofed packets, however what remains to be done is that it needs to perform a MITM to keep real DNS answers from competing with our's. Once the packet has been logged, MITM can be terminated and the target can resume regular web browsing with the wrong ip cached for whatever site it was looking for. Aging times for spoofed addresses are set high to keep the target from re-acquiring the true ip.", "shortname": "dnslanspoofer", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "DNS Lan Spoofer", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1305844}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dnslanspoofer/", "video_url": ""}
