It features a state-of-the-art display, a USB port, an SD port, and eight rows of keys - one of them for softkeys. \r\n\r\nWP 43S is going to come pretty close to the ultimate RPN scientific calculator - at least that's what we will be trying to reach.  That means it will be instant-on, including all the mathematics you can expect in such a package, all the keystroke programming capabilities you need to solve repetitive as well as iterative problems easily, and all the I/O channels for reliable backup and easy linking to an arbitrary host computer.\r\n\r\nRight now, the prototype hardware is under development still - and the firmware team is waiting for it to start its work asap.
