This software, Okikisoft, was specially developed for researches. Okikisoft automatically and invisibly visits the pages of sourceforge to extract the required data.

Okikisoft, for instance, was able to mined 1948 software data ranging from March 1, 2013 to April 30, 2014 within 8 hours which with experience would have taken three (3) experienced workers 168 hours (7 days) to accomplish.\r\nResearcher: Ogunyinka, Peter\r\nDeveloper: Chukwudi.", "shortname": "okikisoft", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2318695}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/okikisoft/", "video_url": null}
