The slices are laid out vertically, offset from each other roughly one inch with standoffs between each layer which from a short distance will appear spherical in shape. Current layout contains 766 total LEDs to obtain good animation resolution. \r\n\r\nThe LEDs are animated with a PIC18 microcontroller, the driver software and electronics are custom. Current design calls for STP16CP 16-bit shift registers for the multiplexer output stage.
