It will show the images of the symbols in order or at random, however you choose, and will have the sounds and English letter equivalent next to it.\r\n\r\nThis project is in it's infancy.  For right now it is intended to learn the Sanskrit \"alphabet\" only.  It is a program to show the symbol in Sanskrit and allow you to see the English equivalent letters and eventually I want to add sound files to each symbol as well.\r\n\r\nYou will be able to see and hear each symbol and cycle through them.  You can turn on or off the English equivalent and the sounds to review to see if you learned it.\r\n\r\nI may add more words and instructionals to this over time to expand beyond just learning the symbols, but for right now it is what it is.\r\n\r\nIf you are wondering why anyone would want to learn Sanskrit you will need to look deeply into the language.  Look into the \"spiritual aspect\" of it and the rich history of the sounds and deep meanings.
