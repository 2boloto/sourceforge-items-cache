drag adjacent letters.\r\n\r\nThe letters can be joined horizontally, vertically or diagonally to form words. \r\n\r\nThe game features several playing modes: \r\n1) Practice mode to enjoy unrestricted game play \r\n2) Standard mode to play a two minute game \r\n3) No-Guessing mode to enjoy playing carefully with a maximum of twenty guesses \r\n4) Challenge mode to play with an initial time of fifteen seconds and time increments or decrements for each correct word or guess.\r\n\r\n  The game shows a Found List as you form words and a Missed List once you abort or the game ends. \r\n\r\n  Each English word has points associated with it based on how long it is and the letters used (letters like X,Q,Z having more value than E,I,N).\r\n\r\n  It is hoped that the game will improve the player's vocabulary and word power.", "shortname": "lexico", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}],
