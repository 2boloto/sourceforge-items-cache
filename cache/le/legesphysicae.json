It would be programed as an extensible, modular platform for socially driven collaborative designing and simulation online. With development the aim is to simulate aircraft, vehicles, boats spaceships, solar systems, economies, clothes and characters in a persistent user driven universe. \r\n\r\nFully developed it should be able to simulate the dynamics of flight, the mechanics vehicles, the buoyancy of ships, and the gravity for spaceships in a large 3D system. The the plan is to use the OGRE graphics engine with Bullet Physics along with a slew of abstraction layers and modern programing methods to build a realistic and enjoyable simulator. If you are interested in helping make this project a reality contact us, we are in need a variety of skills to establish and publicize this project.
