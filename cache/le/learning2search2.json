Given two sets of graphs, with one set labelled positive, it finds subgraphs that are common in the positive graphs and uncommon in the negative graphs. In other words, the occurrences of these subgraphs within the graphs discriminate between the positive and negative graph set. The mined subgraphs describe some common nature of the positive graphs and can be used as features to for classification.\r\nLTS uses 2 passes to improve its accuracy and performance. The first pass aggressively prunes the search space, achieving fast time but lower quality results. The second pass is less aggressive and uses the history learned from the first pass to guide its search, hence the name \"Learning to Search\".", "shortname": "learning2search2", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Discriminative subgraph mining by learning from search history", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2010750}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/learning2search2/", "video_url": ""}
