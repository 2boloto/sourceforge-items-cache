This prototype consists of a lexical transducer modeling the set of words that can potentially be built using these derivational affixes. This transducer was compiled from a morphotactics and morphophonological description of this lexicon fragment as well as orthographic alternation rules formalized in the xfst and lexc finite-state programming languages. Its main feature is the ability to analyze neologisms built from non-lexicalized words borrowed from other languages.", "shortname": "lexpor", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Morphological Analyzer of Portuguese", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 784878}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lexpor/", "video_url": ""}
