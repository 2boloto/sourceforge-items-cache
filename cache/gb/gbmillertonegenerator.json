I needed this and thought at first that everyone and their brother had already written a simple program to output a sound using the default sound device on a windows 32 or 64 computer by typing tone plus frequency and duration (in milliseconds) Tone 1000 2000 (1khz at 2 seconds) great for server farms. This is a spin-off of a project of controlling a inteliport III. I got lazy and will just use mp3 files to do the job. This program is written using windows API calls and works on 32/64 bit systems (apple macbook pro using win 7 32 bit pro and also a 64 bit hp computer running win 7 ultimate 64. I did find out this had problems running on a 32 bit eee pc 901 running winXp with a realtek HD audio output\u2026I concluded the problem might be with the sound driver.\r\n\r\nUsage:  tone 440 1000  generates 440hz tone for 1 second\r\n\r\nthis was compiled using Code blocks with gcc.\r\n\r\nSource code included", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gbmillertonegenerator", "_id": "5393223b24b0d92ac1428a45", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2253649, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Windows console tone generator, ", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio", "shortname": "sound", "fullname": "Sound/Audio", "id": 113}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Sound Synthesis", "shortname": "synthesis", "fullname": "Sound Synthesis", "id": 249}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
