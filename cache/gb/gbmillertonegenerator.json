I needed this and thought at first that everyone and their brother had already written a simple program to output a sound using the default sound device on a windows 32 or 64 computer by typing tone plus frequency and duration (in milliseconds) Tone 1000 2000 (1khz at 2 seconds) great for server farms. This is a spin-off of a project of controlling a inteliport III. I got lazy and will just use mp3 files to do the job. This program is written using windows API calls and works on 32/64 bit systems (apple macbook pro using win 7 32 bit pro and also a 64 bit hp computer running win 7 ultimate 64. I did find out this had problems running on a 32 bit eee pc 901 running winXp with a realtek HD audio output\u2026I concluded the problem might be with the sound driver.\r\n\r\nUsage:  tone 440 1000  generates 440hz tone for 1 second\r\n\r\nthis was compiled using Code blocks with gcc.\r\n\r\nSource code included", "shortname": "gbmillertonegenerator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Windows console tone generator, ", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2253649}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gbmillertonegenerator/", "video_url": null}
