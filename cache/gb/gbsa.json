The GbSA is a continuous optimization algorithm inspired from nature. It tries to mimic the spiral movement of spiral galaxies along with a chaotic process to search the solution space for a given continuous optimization problem. For this purpose, a local search is also employed for fine-tuning of the obtained solution. \r\nFor the first implementation, the GbSA is developed for MATLAB environment for function optimization. Any questions or comments are welcomed especially through the Facebook.
