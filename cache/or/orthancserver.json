It is designed to improve the DICOM flows in hospitals and to support research about the automated analysis of medical images.\r\n\r\nOrthanc can turn any computer running Windows or Linux into a DICOM store (in other words, a mini-PACS system). Its architecture is lightweight, cross-platform and standalone, meaning that no complex database administration is required, nor the installation of third-party dependencies.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Orthanc unique is the fact that it provides a RESTful API. Thanks to this major feature, it is possible to drive Orthanc from any computer language. Orthanc lets its users focus on the content of the DICOM files, hiding the complexity of the DICOM format and of the DICOM protocol.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Windows binaries can be downloaded on the official Web site - http://www.orthanc-server.com/download-windows.php", "shortname": "orthancserver", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "OrthancServer", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/orthancdicom", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Lightweight, RESTful DICOM server for healthcare and medical research", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2279295}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/orthancserver/", "video_url": null}
