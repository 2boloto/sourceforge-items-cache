It can be used to generate servlet responses in Java web-applications.\r\n\r\nWhy not use a presentation layer framework? Client-side developers are usually happy to build HTML, Javascript and CSS code using a simple editor and a browser. Server-side developers, on the other hand, prefer to develop object-oriented Java code using their favorite Java IDE. The problem with presentation layer frameworks is that they force these two types of development efforts to converge to a third platform, such as JSP, JSF, GWT or Wicket. This results in a big drop in productivity and general unhappiness in the team. \r\n\r\nHTMLSplicer offers an alternative where client-side and server-side developers can work independently, provided that they agree on the structure of HTTP requests, and \"splicing\" operations needed to generate responses.
