The first draft was released in 2008, people started writing about it, and using it, but the support in different browsers was still poor. Today all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer) offer HTML5 support, therefore the newest HTML technology can be used at its best today. HTML5 used  with CSS3 and is still in development. W3C organization plans to release a stable version of HTML5 in  next year, but it still looks like this is a long shot. Since its release, HTML5 has been in continuous development, with the W3C adding more impressive features, therefore it seems quite unlikely that HTML5\u2032s development will end soon, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
