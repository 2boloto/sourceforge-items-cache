It was developed for educative purposes and is not meant for usage in complex projects, as it is optimized for understanding, not performance.\r\n\r\nDesigned as an abstract generic Singleton class, you need to derive your own engine from this class and customize it to fit your needs.\r\n\r\nWGDIEngine is made to support the most basic necessities of simple games providing an interface for key and mouse input and using double buffered drawings as output. There is no sound or extended image support. If you need this, use a real game engine instead.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wgdiengine", "developers": [], "external_homepage": ""}
