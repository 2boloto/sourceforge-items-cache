New Admin/Configuration code! Fixed many bugs! \r\n\r\nSLAG is a simple web image album gallery. PHP and optional JavaScript. Supports themes & plugins. So far has two themes based on ZenPhoto; and two extensions, jQuery and NivoSlider. Just throw the code up on the Web.\r\n\r\nYou will have to create your own images & thumbnails (a few samples provided), and use FTP. But it's easy to get an image/photo size/resize program -- one probably came with your camera! \r\n\r\nVersion 1.5.0 11/16/12\r\n\r\nI can now honestly declare that this is, in my opinion, pretty good code. The code is small and efficient. It is basically self-configuring. It will work with minimal configuration and the default settings. You can configure locally or remotely.\r\n\r\nYOU DO NEED TO SETUP A REMOTE PASSWORD FIRST -- I may fix this.\r\n\r\nPLEASE REVIEW THE FILES 'README' AND 'INSTALL' BEFORE INSTALLING.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "slagphoto", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple Little Album Gallery", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 647216}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/slagphoto/", "video_url": ""}
