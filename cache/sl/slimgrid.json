The main design goals are: minimalism, simplicity, pervasiveness. If you need to grab something which does not require you to comprehend massive and complex API's, do exhaustive  configurations and installations, is robust and reliable, uses just one port for all management and communication, then SlimGrid is the right choice. The SlimGrid is built on top of the Apache's ZooKeeper library for coordination of distributed systems and Apache Curator awesome API simplification.\r\n\r\nSlimgrid allows also one-way synchronization of grid application folders (from the server to workers). This is useful when the grid app has been updated. \r\n\r\nSlimgrid is very robust. One of his successful mission was to perform more than 140.000 tasks in the grid with 40+ computers located in three different countries (Norway, Germany, Canada) and behind various firewalls (University labs).", "shortname": "slimgrid", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1780518}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/slimgrid/", "video_url": null}
