But you need to remember to do this every time. Sleep# handles this automatically:\r\n\r\nSleep# sends your computer to sleep after the playback of fullscreen video, providing Windows has been idle for a predefined amount of time.\r\n\r\nThere is a grace period at the end of the fullscreen video before sending your computer to sleep, allowing you to interrupt the process should you still be awake.\r\n\r\nSleep# works with VLC media player, Windows Media Player and BBC iPlayer amongst others. If Sleep# does not manage to detect the end of the video with a particular application, it will send the computer to sleep when the screensaver becomes active at the end of the video.", "shortname": "sleepsharp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Send computer to sleep after VLC, Windows Media Player, BBC iPlayer...", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 671595}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sleepsharp/", "video_url": ""}
