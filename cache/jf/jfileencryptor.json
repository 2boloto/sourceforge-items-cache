Alternatively self generated AES keys can be used instead of a passphrase however, then Demi-God keys may not be used.\r\n\r\nFiles are then decrypted using either a God key (or master key which contains all information needed to decrypt a file), Demi-God key (requires the key file and a password from the user) or Ritual key (salt,iv and password are spread over a user defined number of key files).\r\n\r\nThis application requires:\r\n- Java runtime 7+\r\n- JCE Unlimted Strength Policy files for 192 and 256bit AES. \r\nDownload here:  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html\r\nInstallation see:  http://www.ngs.ac.uk/tools/jcepolicyfiles", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jfileencryptor", "_id": "4fd869f7b9363c6fc6000003", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Forum"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 793534, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Encrypt & decrypt files using AES-128,192 & 256 with PBE & key files", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "shortname": "security", "fullname": "Security", "id": 43}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Cryptography", "shortname": "cryptography", "fullname": "Cryptography", "id": 44}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
