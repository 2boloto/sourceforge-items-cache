It's designed to convert many different formats from sources like oscilloscopes, simulators, data loggers and audio into the formats you need to get you going.\r\n\r\nWe plan to convert voltage waveforms so that you can get them inside your favorite waveform generator, simulator, math program, spreadsheet, statistics program or even your own custom application.\r\n\r\nWe'll do this by converting the source format into a intermediate, standard, format. From there we can convert the intermediate format into the output format. That way we don't have as many combinations to support.\r\n\r\nA future plan is to include waveform generation and editing capabilities.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to make oscilloscopes, waveform generators and simulators understand each other flawlessly.", "shortname": "waveslator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Waveslator converts your oscilloscope waveforms into usable formats", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2374868}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/waveslator/", "video_url": null}
