Resting on the ocean bottom for nearly 70 years, the hulls of these shipwrecks have no doubt deteriorated; if they still contain fuel oil, these wrecks pose the very real threat of an environmental \r\ndisaster. Assessing the condition of the shipwrecks and determining what to do with any hazardous material that remains on board is the very real world challenge facing this yearâ€™s competition teams.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "watervehicles", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ageslome/", "username": "ageslome", "name": "ages lome"}], "external_homepage": "http://ageslome.sitesled.com/lbccrov/index.html"}
