Your goal is to keep the Ball in the Game, until it destroyed all Blocks by hitting them. There are different kinds of Blocks and also some special Blocks (like Bombs) in 5 different levels.\r\n\r\nThe Game uses OpenGL and has some Advanced shader effects (like for the Water). The models where created in Blender and exported to the Wavefront-Obj format.\r\n\r\nIt is only a small Studentproject, so there are no sounds and no Highscorelist. Maybe we will continue the development of this game and bring out a enhanced version in the future.", "shortname": "waterbreakout", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "a Breakoutgame on an animated Watersurface (University Project)", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 767223}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/waterbreakout/", "video_url": ""}
