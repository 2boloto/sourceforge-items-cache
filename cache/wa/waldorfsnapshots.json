It is quite simply a default CrunchBang Waldorf install. Upgraded to Jessie, and fixed to be compatible with Jessie and Systemd. \r\n\r\nJessie is now the new stable, and it should be fine to run this image for the next two years.\r\n\r\nIf at all possible, I will do exactly the same for the future Debian releases, and in that process it's also possible that I will add a testing/unstable image, and share it with anyone who wants it.\r\n\r\nOnce again, this is just a snapshot of a clean running system. Not a release. Mainly to see how long I can keep Waldorf healthy.\r\n\r\nUse at own risk. I'm in no way responsible for any outcome of anyone using these images, and I offer no official support for it. \r\n\r\nEnjoy, and good luck :)", "shortname": "waldorfsnapshots", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Snapshots of running #!
