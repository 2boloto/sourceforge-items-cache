You know those things where our kids hopes of prizes are inflated and then dashed or where our children are pressured with sales quotas. Fundraisers SUCK! We're here to change that.\r\n\r\nIntroducing WaddaFundraiser! WaddaFundraiser provides FREE software for fundraisers to sell or use as rewards for donations so that the fundraiser gets to keep ALL of the funds raised! \r\n\r\nWaddaFundraiser's first project is developing a customizable, fun, eye-catching Android Live Wallpaper. A fundraiser will be able to customize the live wallpaper to provide a unique wallpaper all their own. E.g. a school will be able to easily replace the default graphics with the school's logo and colors. The WaddaFundraiser application will provide all the sizzling special effects.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "waddafundraiser", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/andyg54321/", "username": "andyg54321", "name": "A GREEN"}], "external_homepage": "www.waddafundraiser.org"}
