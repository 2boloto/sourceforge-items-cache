Combinig several theoretical approaches a core model is presented that describes transcriptional and allosteric control of glycolysis in Escherichia coli. Experimental data based on microarrays, signalling components and extracellular metabolites are used to estimate kinetic parameters. A newly designed strain was used that adjusts the\r\nincoming glucose flux into the system and allows a kinetic analysis. Based on the results,\r\nprediction for intracelluar metabolite concentrations over a broad range of the growth rate could be performed and\r\ncompared with data from literature.\r\n\r\nNote that this web-site is currently under construction!!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "sysbioecolimode", "_id": "50754b810594ca4fc902847e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1019961, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Mathematical modeling of E. coli carbohydrate uptake and metabolism", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
