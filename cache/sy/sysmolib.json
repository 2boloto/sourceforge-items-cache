The library can be used in congruence with other C++ libraries, such as graphical libraries, and thus can be utilized in a myriad of situations, from game programming to scientific modelling to data management. The possible uses for this library are yet to be fully realized, and are only limited by the imagination of the developer utilizing the SysMo library.\r\n\r\nThe conceptual idea behind the SysMo library originates from entity relationship databasing models, in which the library allows you to establish particle or entity types, attributes or characteristics of said particles, and relationships between particle types. Utilizing this method of modelling with particle systems, as well as utilizing extensive generic programming concepts, allow this library to be as extensible and usable as possible for virtually any situation.", "shortname": "sysmolib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A C++ library for modelling any 2D or 3D particle systems.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1839845}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sysmolib/", "video_url": ""}
