He released a 4/5ths-finished version as an HTA and I have used that as a basis for this, adding missing code and replacing other parts with code in my preferred style.\r\n\r\nHaving selected or created a list of machine names (or a group name from AD), this HTA will visit each machine in turn (if present on the network) and create an HTML report of various standard items e.g. RAM and hard drives present and allows you to select other items to report, e.g. running services, processes and so on. As each report is based on WMI queries, you can obviously extend the list.\r\n\r\nHopefully, the code's modularity enables you to plug in extras or edit what's already there to suit your own requirements.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I'd be interested in receiving your feedback but note that I work for clients full-time and thus support - such as it is! - will be on a \"best endeavours\" basis.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "systemdocumentr", "_id": "5134683404161f37730c06ca", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1326324, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Document network machines", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
