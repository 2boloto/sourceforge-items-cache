The point name can be any name, preferrably lower case for the first letter.\r\nA[p1, p2, ..., pn] : A represents one set of points, while p* (or any name, preferrably lower case for the first letter) represents n points. Define a set A with n points. \r\nA+B: A represents one set of points, while B represents another set. Applying '+' symbol will aggregate A and B and assign the results to A. \r\nA-B: Similarly, Applying '-' symbol will remove the common subset of A and B from A, then assign the results to A.\r\n *c: c represents a Color object. Applying '*' symbol to c will set the color of all point set.\r\netc.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "symmapnet", "_id": "51007c26b9363c079fee77a0", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1253312, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "SymMAP.NET is an open source project attempting to support symbol lang", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
