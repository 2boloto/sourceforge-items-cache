For now, only the following symbol operation are supported:\r\np(lat,lon) : define a point with lat and lon. The point name can be any name, preferrably lower case for the first letter.\r\nA[p1, p2, ..., pn] : A represents one set of points, while p* (or any name, preferrably lower case for the first letter) represents n points. Define a set A with n points. \r\nA+B: A represents one set of points, while B represents another set. Applying '+' symbol will aggregate A and B and assign the results to A. \r\nA-B: Similarly, Applying '-' symbol will remove the common subset of A and B from A, then assign the results to A.\r\n *c: c represents a Color object.
