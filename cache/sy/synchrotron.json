Leveraging Java technology, the project team will develop a platform-independent library, and graphical user-interface components for the Windows, OSX, and Linux desktop platforms and the Android and iOS mobile platforms. The software will minimally support synchronization with local file systems as well as (Secure) FTP and (Secure) WebDAV. Finally, the software will feature a flexible file filtering system that will allow users to define multiple synchronization profiles, each one consisting of a defined subset of the file tree. For example, the user may define separate profiles for the desktop machines and mobile devices, such that the desktop machines retrieve all files from a server, but mobile devices retrieve only documents, images, and low quality videos.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "synchrotron", "_id": "5088b6a90594ca1f3c7831af", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1042416, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Universal network file synchronization utility", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
