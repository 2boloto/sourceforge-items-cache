It\u2019s simple, and flexible. I\u2019ve tried my best in making the software simple, clean and readable by adding comments. I\u2019m a newbie in developing so this script may not be perfect but it is pretty sufficient for the basic needs of creating an online notebook system. Wrupit is a small, simple opensource project that allows you to setup your own \u201conline notebook\u201d in minutes. It requires extremely less coding skills. All you need is to install and configure it. It took me around 2 days to make it. Thanks to few other opensource projects which helped me reduce the developing time.\r\n\r\nThis project has been released under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
