One written in C++ which is the fastest, at least for the heavier objective functions, and a Dynadec Comet solver which lets you easily post new constraints along with the Magic-constraints. \r\n\r\nAuthor: Johan Öfverstedt", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wrmssolver", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/johanofverstedt/", "username": "johanofverstedt", "name": "Johan Öfverstedt"}], "external_homepage": ""}
