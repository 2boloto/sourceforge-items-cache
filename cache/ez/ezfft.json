This is currently still a work in progress, but the FFT portion (complex and real) both output the correct results, and the code executes very quickly, around only 30% or so slower than the much more difficult to compile FFTW on SSE enabled platforms. Though optimized code only runs on SSE (x86) based platforms, it's a very simple matter to port the existing code to any other platform with different SIMD intrinsics by simply implementing a small number of inlines that map to a small number of intrinsics.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm currently used is Radix-2, so there's easily room for speed improvements.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ezfft", "_id": "502ca8b51be1ce45a61dd60b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 859229, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Templated Fast Fourier Transform in C++", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
