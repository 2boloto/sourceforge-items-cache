This is currently still a work in progress, but the FFT portion (complex and real) both output the correct results, and the code executes very quickly, around only 30% or so slower than the much more difficult to compile FFTW on SSE enabled platforms. Though optimized code only runs on SSE (x86) based platforms, it's a very simple matter to port the existing code to any other platform with different SIMD intrinsics by simply implementing a small number of inlines that map to a small number of intrinsics.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm currently used is Radix-2, so there's easily room for speed improvements.", "shortname": "ezfft", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Templated Fast Fourier Transform in C++", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 859229}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ezfft/", "video_url": null}
