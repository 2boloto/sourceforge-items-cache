This one is used to create the meta environment.\r\nThe meta environment describes a target environment. The target environment is the actual application that can be build. The building is done by using codeblocks as much as possible. Hopefully completely with code blocks.\r\n\r\nRelease plan:\r\n\r\ncreate a metameta environment where entity-types can be added and relations can be managed. Finished August 10 2015.\r\nGenerate the meta environment out of the metameta environment 2-3 weeks\r\n\r\nThe current status August 2 is the editing of metameta. A relation editor has to be created. This one can be used in target and meta also.\r\nFeedback on this release plan is welcome", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ezbuild", "_id": "5381e08c85540d2280ebea4b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2241360, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Application generation framework", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
