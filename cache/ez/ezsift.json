Most of the open-source SIFT implementations rely on some 3rd-party libraries. Some of them even rely on a few different large libraries. These dependencies make the installation, compilation and usage not easy.\r\n\r\nThe ezSIFT library provides a standalone and lightweight SIFT implementation written in C/C++. The ezSIFT is self-contained, and does not require any other libraries. So it is easy to use and modify. Besides, the implementation of the ezSIFT is straightforward and easy to read.\r\n\r\nC/C++ source code, Visual Studio 2010\u30012012 project, and Android NDK project are provided.\r\n\r\ngit user, please use the following link to pull the latest code:\r\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ezsift/code ezsift-code\r\n\r\nPlease read wiki page for more details:\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/ezsift/wiki/", "shortname": "ezsift", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An easy-to-use standalone SIFT library written in C/C++", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1954377}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ezsift/", "video_url": null}
