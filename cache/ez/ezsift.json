Most of the open-source SIFT implementations rely on some 3rd-party libraries. Some of them even rely on a few different large libraries. These dependencies make the installation, compilation and usage not easy.\r\n\r\nThe ezSIFT library provides a standalone and lightweight SIFT implementation written in C/C++. The ezSIFT is self-contained, and does not require any other libraries. So it is easy to use and modify. Besides, the implementation of the ezSIFT is straightforward and easy to read.\r\n\r\nC/C++ source code, Visual Studio 2010\u30012012 project, and Android NDK project are provided.\r\n\r\ngit user, please use the following link to pull the latest code:\r\ngit clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ezsift/code ezsift-code\r\n\r\nPlease read wiki page for more details:\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/ezsift/wiki/", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ezsift", "_id": "523658c1f1fd8d2a616abf26", "tools": [{"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1954377, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}], "summary": "An easy-to-use standalone SIFT library written in C/C++", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics", "shortname": "graphics", "fullname": "Graphics", "id": 100}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Human Machine Interfaces", "shortname": "HMI", "fullname": "Human Machine Interfaces", "id": 272}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Handheld/Embedded Operating Systems :: Android", "shortname": "android", "fullname": "Android", "id": 728}]}}
