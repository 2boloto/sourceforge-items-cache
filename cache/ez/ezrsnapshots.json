The scheduling work is done by the program not cron. There are no concerns about cron timing overlap or tuning cron and anacron entries.  On a laptop a  missed daily(or monthly, etc..)  backup will be automatically produced as soon as the machine is turned back on.\r\n\r\nezrsnapshots creates the same result (still creating daily, weekly, monthly and yearly backups, or custom intervals. ) with only one crontab entry without ever renaming, rotating, or promoting any backups after they are initially made. For each source, snapshots are contained in a single date-sortable directory.\r\n\r\nMike Rubel's blog was an easy way to get something working using available tools and minimal work, but uses tedious sync/rotate/promote with complex crontab structures. If writing a program, we can do better.\r\n", "shortname": "ezrsnapshots", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "rsnapshot alternative with simpler config and simpler laptop support", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1094115}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ezrsnapshots/", "video_url": ""}
