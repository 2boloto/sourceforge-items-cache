Designated initializers or named arguments(for const constructor only could be enough) was one of them. When we see full C++ 11 standard... We were disappointed... So we need new language from scratch not a library. We choose C because it has designated initializers and has much more clean interface.\r\n\r\nNow design of language unbounded, is stack based. Every word pushes to stack and some keyword or symbols pops and completes stack. Each complete stack updates database. Database is core of language unbounded. Libraries are databases in language unbounded! When compiled, only used objects are in binary.\r\n\r\nUnbounded language is not imperative only or functional only. We do not intent to force programmer while using language unbounded.
