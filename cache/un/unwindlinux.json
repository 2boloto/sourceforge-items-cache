Elmore founded the project as a hobby when he was 16, to find out more about computer programming, and was disappointed with the current \"out-of-the-box\" Linux distros as he would call them (such as Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc.). It was founded in 2012 out of Indianapolis, Indiana, US. Unwind is an Arch Linux-based distro aimed at working right out-of-the-box, basically saying \"relax, let us handle the drivers, firmware, updates and such\". The project aims at a new version every half a year (6 months), unless a critical update is needed. While the project aims at working without any configuration needed, the project uses minimal proprietary and third-party drivers and software.", "shortname": "unwindlinux", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "An Arch Linux-based linux distro with little to no setup required.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 820368}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/unwindlinux/", "video_url": ""}
