We propose Java-based media streaming over IP utilizing the Matroska (MKV) container, which is rapidly gaining popularity within online user communities. Fast and accurate access to individual MKV elements is ensured by a hinting mechanism tailored to the container. The achieved throughput and continuous playback capability has been examined under RTSP/TCP with UDP transmission over Wi-Fi, which is setup via a single port or via multiple ports. New avenues for media traffic differentiation with the proposed framework are highlighted. \r\nThe project is suitable for research and advanced graduate courses on video streaming systems over the Internet Protocol.\r\nFor a technical overview of the basic features, please see:\r\nI.
