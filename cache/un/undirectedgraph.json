We used this module internally for the development\r\nof our project. Later on as this tool helped us a lot to ?gure out several bugs\r\ninside our code- work, we thought that it is worth a mention.This tool is built\r\nupon GTK+ and Graphviz. GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) is a cross-platform widget toolkit\r\nfor creating graphical user interfaces. (ref: Wikipedia) It is also the\r\nfundamental user interface toolkit of object model environment for most of the\r\n*nix operating systems. Graphviz (short for Graph Visualization Software) is a\r\npackage of open-source tools initiated by AT&T Labs Research for drawing graphs\r\nspeci?ed in DOT language scripts. (ref: Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nThis editor could be a full-blown integrated development environment to work\r\nwith com- plex graphs, thus there is a large scope for its continued\r\ndevelopment. A lot of visual elements could still be picked up from the DOT\r\nlan", "shortname": "undirectedgraph", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1883482}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/undirectedgraph/", "video_url": ""}
