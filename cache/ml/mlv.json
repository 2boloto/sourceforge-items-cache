The important thing of this project is the MLV.dll file. \r\nThis file contains ManagedListView component which is a UserControl that can be used in .Net applications.\r\n\r\nThis control is a customizable list view control. You can draw columns as you like, items as you like without 'slow' problems. However that doesn't mean you get the fastest thing but let's say it's better than normal ListView. No need to install any external components in the target pc to get it working (except the .net framework of course). If you don't like the look of the columns for example go ahead and change the way it get drown, it's your choice ;)\r\n\r\nRemember this is a .net library uses System.Windows.Forms namespace so it targets Windows platform only.\r\n\r\nThis is an article of this project provides all the information:\r\nhttp://www.codeproject.com/Articles/538518/Managed-ListView", "shortname": "mlv", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1264871}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mlv/", "video_url": ""}
