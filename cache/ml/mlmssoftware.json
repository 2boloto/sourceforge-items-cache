It is used to identify microorganisms, protein, chemical compounds and complex diseases by blood analysis. There is many tools and libraries to handle different steps of mass spectrometry (MS) data analysis. However, the integration of all these tools lacks user friendly approaches. We developed a machine learning solution capable to handle all steps of MS data analysis. The ML-MS Tool is an free software that integrate different mass spectrometry analysis techniques with machine learning approach. We focused in automatic feature extraction, avoiding the need of manual peaks analysis of biomarkers. With all feature extracted ML-MS versatile classification tool avoiding the need reprocess the new MS samples. ML-MS is divided into two sub-products, the ML-MS Tool and the ML-MS Library; both products are free and open source. The ML-MS Library is focused on script routines.", "shortname": "mlmssoftware", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Generic Free and Open-Source Tool for Mass Spectrometry Analysis", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2450644}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mlmssoftware/", "video_url": null}
