However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new content to UpToDate and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This project investigates the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using UpToDate as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology \u2013 congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation. While the existing content of UpToDate is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content are being released incrementally.\r\n\r\nThis project was also funded partly by Mayo Clinic's internal resources.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cksauthorer", "_id": "5217a660b9363c21fdbd76b3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1938026, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Work in progress K99/R00 project at Mayo and Northwestern", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
