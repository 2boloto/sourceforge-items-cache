Other formats are closed formats used by singular Karaoke programs or video files with no control over Text-Audio synchronization.\r\n\r\nMy plan consists in a format that is human readable, can be edited by everyone, easily be imported into any editor and can possibly be played by any Karaoke player since it is open and the specifications of the format will be made clear.\r\nThe basic idea is an XML Karaoke format with CSS support. It should be close to HTML in its CSS support but very specific to its own needs in the usage of XML elements. The first step that has to be done within this project is to specify such a format. Lateron, an editor will be implemented that can write basic karaoke xml files.\r\nAt last, a karaoke player will be incorporated into this project.", "shortname": "karamel", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Karaoke editor with an open, easily readable Karaoke-XML format.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1777633}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "karamel-player", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/karamel/", "video_url": ""}
