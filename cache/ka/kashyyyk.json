It was originally written to replace HexChat on OS X. At the time, HexChat (a fork of XChat) had only had a single release on OS X, which was still in alpha. \r\n\r\nKashyyyk is extremely small, the binaries and related libraries totaling around half a megabyte. Kashyyyk also has very few external dependencies, the official binaries statically linking all supporting libraries.\r\n\r\nKashyyyk is natively available for OS X, Windows, and FreeBSD. Additionally, it can be compiled for Cygwin/X.\r\nWhen possible, Kashyyyk takes advantage of native OS capabilites, such as the OS X notification center.\r\n\r\nKashyyyk uses the libfjirc library originally written for the Whittler IRC bot and the libfjnet wrapper written for TurboSphere. It has an FLTK-based GUI. Kashyyyk is intended to be cross platform and easily compiled. It is known to compile using Clang, GCC, Cygwin, Sun Studio, and MSVC 2013.", "shortname": "kashyyyk", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Work-In-Progress, Full-Featured, Open Source IRC Client", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2343404}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kashyyyk/", "video_url": null}
