The music is extracted in its original format, and the lyrics can be extracted in LRC or LRC2 format.\r\n\r\nYou will find it handy when your old Karaoke player malfunctions. Then you typically find out that your player model it is not manufactured anymore, and that the new model comes with a different disk which doesn't have your favorite songs. And of course it does not read the disk from the old player either. In this case the only way you can access the songs from your old player disk is by extracting them into the music/lyrics files, and use some karaoke player like XBMC to play them.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "karaokediskeunp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 248723}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/karaokediskeunp/", "video_url": ""}
