In addition, words are sorted by frequency and no\r\nduplicate words are used.\r\n\r\nFor example, assume that \u5f84 is the 882nd kanji in the user-provided kanji list and that we are\r\nusing the default options. The words that will be generated for \u5f84 will only contain kanji from the\r\n1st kanji in the list to the 882nd kanji in the list.", "shortname": "kanjiwordassoci", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Learn kanji and words at the same time in the most optimal way", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1888580}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kanjiwordassoci/", "video_url": null}
