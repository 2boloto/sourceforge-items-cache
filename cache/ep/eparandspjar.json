However, a large portion of rules reported by these algorithms just satisfy the user-defined constraints purely by accident, and cannot express real systematic effects in data sets. Thus, such rules are false positives that could be filtered out through statistical significance testing. In the context of association rule discovery, the permutation-based approach can achieve better performance than other competitive methods, whereas several drawbacks of this effective approach narrow down its usability. In this paper, we provide an analysis of these disadvantages and propose an algorithm called EPAR to calculate exactp-values of all tested rules. Experiments on the data sets demonstrate that EPAR can successfully alleviate those disadvantages and outperform the direct permutation-based method over several performance measures.
