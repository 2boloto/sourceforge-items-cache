Main core has been written in few hours and it works well. There are few pseudo instructions for creating pseudo programs. This can help you to understand, what does instruction set really mean and how computer processing works.\r\n    \r\nYou can sort some numbers from input tape, compute prime numbers and write result to output tape. With adding in cycle you can supply instruction of multiply. Direct and indirect addressing included. And you can do it all now on your android Phone during bus ride instead of boring aplet.\r\n\r\nI know, for mainstream user it is an incredibly useless app. Here it IS as it IS.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "epsiram", "_id": "5033fa210594ca22e20afe21", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 865677, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "RAM machine for Android", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Handheld/Embedded Operating Systems :: Android", "shortname": "android", "fullname": "Android", "id": 728}]}}
