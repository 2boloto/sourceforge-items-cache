EnergyPlus is a whole building energy simulation program that engineers, architects, and researchers use to model energy and water use in buildings: http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/. EPparallel splits a single annual EnergyPlus simulation into 12 simulations, runs them in parallel over a cluster of 12 nodes, and collates the results once the simulations are finished. It uses Message Passing Interface API and runs on Linux. It is based on the earlier studies done on the methodology for speeding EnergyPlus simulation by splitting an annual EnergyPlus simulation into multiple smaller simulations: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19401493.2010.531142", "shortname": "epparallel", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Tool for EnergyPlus parallelization", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1772317}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/epparallel/", "video_url": ""}
