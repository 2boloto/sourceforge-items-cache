Since about 2002, this program has not been available. EPRI decided to release the simulation kernel of LPDW under an open-source license (GPL v3), so it may be incorporated into IEEE Flash and other projects.\r\n \r\nOpenETran can presently simulate multi-conductor power lines, insulators, surge arresters, non-linear grounds, and lightning strokes. It efficiently calculates energy and charge duty on surge arresters, and iterates to find the critical lightning current causing flashover on one or more phases. It is also suitable for use in substation insulation coordination. Capacitor switching, TRV, and other applicaitons may be added.\r\n \r\nEPRI originally had permission to use code from the Numerical Recipes book in LPDW.
