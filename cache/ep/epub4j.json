This project aims to make a simple API to read and write this format using Java.  While this project intends to be a complete implementation of the EPUB standard, certain aspects such as encryption and signing can be difficult and device specific.  \r\n\r\nThis project is not an EPUB viewer.  Many of those already exist (Adobe Digital Editions, Nook for PC, Calibre's EBook Viewer, and others).  This project is also not an ebook converter.  Calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com/) is an excellent open source ebook manager written in Python.  This project is also not an EPUB validator.  For that, see EPUB Check (http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/).\r\n\r\nI started this project in order to create my own EPUB files from various sources (CBR, PDF, plain text, web sites, and Word docs) so they could be read on my Nook.  \r\n\r\nRecognize that a website still retains the copyright of its owner.
