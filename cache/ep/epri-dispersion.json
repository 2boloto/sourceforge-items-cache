SHARP: The Sub-Hourly AERMOD Run Procedure allows the user to run AERMOD using fine-resolution meteorology.\r\n2. DISTANCE: The DISTANCE_DEBUG tool provides additional output that can be used to diagnose causes for high concentrations. An evaluation of the applicable distance for one-hour applications of AERMOD is also provided.\r\n3. EMVAP: The Emissions Variability Processor allows AERMOD to sample from emissions distributions. A default distribution for SO2 applications and its evaluation is provided.\r\n4. SCICHEM: A version of the SCIPUFF puff model with chemistry. It allows for the simulation of power plants plumes a series of puffs that are transported in the atmosphere while undergoing chemical transformation. SCICHEM can be used for permitting applications and attainment demonstrations.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "epri-dispersion", "_id": "502d36c3b9363c10cb512a6f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "epri-dispersion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 859878, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "SCICHEM 3.0b2, EMVAP, SHARP and Distance Study", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
