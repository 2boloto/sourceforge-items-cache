SHARP: The Sub-Hourly AERMOD Run Procedure allows the user to run AERMOD using fine-resolution meteorology.\r\n2. DISTANCE: The DISTANCE_DEBUG tool provides additional output that can be used to diagnose causes for high concentrations. An evaluation of the applicable distance for one-hour applications of AERMOD is also provided.\r\n3. EMVAP: The Emissions Variability Processor allows AERMOD to sample from emissions distributions. A default distribution for SO2 applications and its evaluation is provided.\r\n4. SCICHEM: A version of the SCIPUFF puff model with chemistry. It allows for the simulation of power plants plumes a series of puffs that are transported in the atmosphere while undergoing chemical transformation. SCICHEM can be used for permitting applications and attainment demonstrations.", "shortname": "epri-dispersion", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "SCICHEM 3.0b2, EMVAP, SHARP and Distance Study", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "epri-dispersion", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 859878}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/epri-dispersion/", "video_url": null}
