Or maybe you just want an easy way to keep something safe? Epixmasc is perfect for just that.\r\n\r\nIt takes the original file, converts it to an Epixmasc file and saves it in the same location. Plus, you can easily revert the files back to their original format by using the log file that is saved when you use Epixmasc. It's also possible to use password protection on your log files!\r\n\r\nIt originally started as a little project to keep important documents safe, and make them useless to the average person. We decided to edit it a little and make it suitable for the public. A list of features, current and planned, can be found on the Wiki. \r\n\r\nSo, try it out, and let us know what you think!\r\n\r\nP.S. - MGN can not be held responsible for the damage/destruction of any files used with Epixmasc.
