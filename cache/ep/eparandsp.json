However, a large portion of\r\nrules reported by these algorithms just satisfy the user-defined\r\nconstraints purely by accident, and cannot express real systematic\r\neffect in data sets. Thus, such rules are false positives that\r\nshould be filtered out through statistical significance testing.\r\nIn the context of association rule discovery, the permutation-based approach can achieve better performance than the other\r\ncompetitive methods, whereas several drawbacks of this effective\r\napproach exist and narrow down its usability. In this paper,\r\nwe provide an analysis of these disadvantages and propose an\r\nalgorithm called EPAR to calculate the exact p-values of all\r\ntested rules. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate\r\nthat EPAR can successfully remove those disadvantages and\r\noutperforms the direct permutation-based method.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "eparandsp", "_id": "53a8ecbdb9363c4522972844", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2266871, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Computing Exact Permutationp-Values for Association Rules", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
