Specifically, the format will support raster attribute tables (commonly not included within other formats), image pyramids, GDAL meta-data, in-built statistics while also providing large file handling with compression used throughout the file. Being based on the HDF5 standard, it will also provide a base from which other formats could be derived and will be a good choice for long term data archiving. An independent software library (KEALib) has been provided through which complete access to the KEA image format is provided alongside a GDAL driver allowing KEA images to be used through any GDAL supported software.\r\n\r\nBunting, P., & Gillingham, S.
