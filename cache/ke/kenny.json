These tests were run by setting up various tournamennts on the free Chess GUI Arena Version 3.0. Kenny uses modified values for evaluation of various parameters, thus introducing almost an entirely new engine, because the evaluation function is the heart of a chess engine.", "shortname": "kenny", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "\"Kenny\" is an XBoard/WinBoard chess engine based on \"Winglet\"", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1272138}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kenny/", "video_url": ""}
