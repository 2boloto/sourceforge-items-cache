It is a chess engine with pure object oriented programming with close-to-real-world representation of the game inside the program using OOPS. Initially I thought of doing a similar thing in C++, but after trying to develop my other chess engine Kenny in this route, I found out that it is a difficult task, and switched to using Java for the programming instead. To learn how to do it, I created a similar, many-times-lesser-in-complexity project KenTacToe.\r\n\r\nHaving completed it successfully, I've gained the confidence to proceed with Kenny ClassIQ, named so because it is more class-oriented than Kenny, and because I want it to be intelligent. (A play with words landed me Kenny ClassIQ.) Also, I used this name so that people searching for my other chess engine Kenny can also find this more advanced chess engine (okay, yes, I wanted to name my chess engine Kenny, so).", "shortname": "kennyclassiq", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A java-based, purely object-oriented chess engine.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1279796}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kennyclassiq/", "video_url": ""}
