The TaskManager was designed to control the utilization of a set of hosts even if you are not the administrator of the system. The hosts are embedded in a Unix environment and the user's home directories are mounted on each host. The hosts may have different numbers of CPUs/cores and different kernels. Keep in mind that a user is able to log into each host and calculate on it. However, he should use the TaskManager to submit calculation jobs to the cluster to avoid an overload of the hosts. Jobs which are under the control of the TaskManager are executed on a host of the computer cluster with the rights of the respective user to ensure that the executing jobs have the permission to access the user's files.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tmpackage", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/hotbdesiato/", "username": "hotbdesiato", "name": "Hendrik"}], "external_homepage": ""}
