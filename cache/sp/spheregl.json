The project has been completed using C++, however  for this version it will use java to make it easier to use.The task involves letting the subject know that he must select a particular colored and shaped object. However, the instruction will be written in a different color than the requested selection. So if the prompt says \"Green Sphere\" the color of the wording will bee any color other than \"green\". Then, using OpenGL, many objects are drawn on a blank canvas along with the requested selection object. The selection object will be one of its kind so the user has to find it and select it. During this search the time it takes the subject to find the object is recorded. Also the subject's brain activity is measured with an FNIR device for later processing. The process will be prompt then objects. This will be repeated for a predetermined time. The Java version of this project will be better looking and more intuitive.", "shortname": "spheregl", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Stroop test using OpenGL", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1027616}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/spheregl/", "video_url": ""}
