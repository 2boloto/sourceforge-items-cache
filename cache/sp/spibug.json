It makes it possible to program SPI devices in scripting languages (e.g. Python or Tcl) and can be used for rapid software prototyping, troubleshooting and debugging.\r\n\r\nThe SPIBUG runs on the very inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware, such as the MSP430 LaunchPad evaluation board available from Texas Instruments for measly $4.30. That's less than a price of a Big Mac and a Coke!\r\n\r\nThe SPIBUG is extensible. Support for other serial protocols, such as I2C and UART is planned in future releases.", "shortname": "spibug", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "SPI bus diagnostics and debugging tool for the price of Big Mac", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 623736}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/spibug/", "video_url": ""}
