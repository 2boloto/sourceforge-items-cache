A chording keyboard or Chorded keyboard is an input device where characters can be typed by pressing multiple keys at the same time. A popular design is the 7-key chorder, where one key is used for each of the index finger, middle finger, ring finger and pinky, and 3 keys for the thumb. This can be used with either the left or right hand (or a chorder can be used for each hand, effectively doubling the typing speed). \r\n\r\nSpiffChorder hardware is based on Atmel AVR ATmega168, using Objective Development's V-USB (a software-only implementation of a low-speed USB device).", "shortname": "spiffchorder", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "FW and HW design for a 7-key chording keyboard", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 620037}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/spiffchorder/", "video_url": ""}
