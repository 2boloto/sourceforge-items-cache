A chording keyboard or Chorded keyboard is an input device where characters can be typed by pressing multiple keys at the same time. A popular design is the 7-key chorder, where one key is used for each of the index finger, middle finger, ring finger and pinky, and 3 keys for the thumb. This can be used with either the left or right hand (or a chorder can be used for each hand, effectively doubling the typing speed). \r\n\r\nSpiffChorder hardware is based on Atmel AVR ATmega168, using Objective Development's V-USB (a software-only implementation of a low-speed USB device).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "spiffchorder", "_id": "5182b9aa5fcbc9798b52f558", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 620037, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "FW and HW design for a 7-key chording keyboard", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Human Machine Interfaces", "shortname": "HMI", "fullname": "Human Machine Interfaces", "id": 272}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Embedded systems", "shortname": "embedded", "fullname": "Embedded systems", "id": 749}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
