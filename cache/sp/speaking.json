This is why public speaking causes so much anxiety and concern.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that, with thorough preparation and practice, you can overcome your nervousness and perform exceptionally well. Even if you don't need to make regular presentations  in front of a group, there are plenty of situations where good public speaking skills can help you advance your career and create opportunities.For example, you might have to talk about your organization at a conference, make a speech after accepting an award, or teach a class to new recruits. Speaking to an audience also includes online presentations or talks; for instance, when training a virtual team, or when speaking to a group of customers in an online meeting.boost your self confidence!!!", "shortname": "speaking", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "better public speaking", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2419323}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/speaking/", "video_url": null}
