This is encapsulated in the SparkAPI project which contains all the classes and helper functions required to easily utilise the API. A set of sample applications demonstrating some simple uses of the API are also available.\r\n\r\nThe component also supports replay from historical files and does not require a connection to the Spark servers when working in file replay mode. This makes it ideal for those wishing to learn how to manipulate and utilise institutional-grade market data in non-institutional setting.\r\n\r\nABOUT SPARK\r\nSpark is a market data provider that supplies real-time exchange grade data feeds for Australian and New Zealand equity and options markets", "shortname": "sparkapi", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@sparkapisdk", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "C# library and samples for processing market data from the Spark API", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1215584}, {"label": "Git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sparkapi/", "video_url": null}
