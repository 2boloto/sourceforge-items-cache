This Diffie Hellman key exchange was written in Java.  The original creator of this program was a student at Youngtown State University, by the name of Naveed Shoaib.  I, Edward Davila, am the developer who is helping in the recreation of the program to have students understand the process of Diffie-Hellman.  I am redeveloping this program to aid students in the Diffie-Hellman cryptography.  I am also looking to expand the code in the use of other cryptography methods.  Please the program is a prototype so use at your own risk.  I am not responsible for anything that could go wrong with your computer, this program has not been tested on multiple OS.
