SPANDx performs alignment of NGS reads against the user\u2019s chosen reference genome or pan-genome, followed by accurate variant calling and annotation, and presence/absence determination. SPANDx identifies the core genome and produces single-nucleotide polymorphism matrices for downstream phylogenetic analyses. Annotated, genome-wide SNPs and indels are identified and output in human readable format. In addition, a presence/absence analysis is performed allowing the identification of the core/accessory genome content.\r\n\r\nSPANDx is designed to run in a cluster environment and utilises PBS or SGE for task parallelisation. \r\nSPANDx v2.6+ includes Generateplink.sh to convert outputs from SPANDx into PLINK format for haploid GWAS. See the SPANDx manual (v2.2) for more detailed usage. \r\n\r\n", "shortname": "spandx", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Comparative analysis of haploid next-generation re-sequencing data", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2097419}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/spandx/", "video_url": null}
