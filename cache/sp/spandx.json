SPANDx performs alignment of NGS reads against the user\u2019s chosen reference genome or pan-genome, followed by accurate variant calling and annotation, and presence/absence determination. SPANDx identifies the core genome and produces single-nucleotide polymorphism matrices for downstream phylogenetic analyses. Annotated, genome-wide SNPs and indels are identified and output in human readable format. In addition, a presence/absence analysis is performed allowing the identification of the core/accessory genome content.\r\n\r\nSPANDx is designed to run in a cluster environment and utilises PBS or SGE for task parallelisation. \r\nSPANDx v2.6+ includes Generateplink.sh to convert outputs from SPANDx into PLINK format for haploid GWAS. See the SPANDx manual (v2.2) for more detailed usage. \r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "spandx", "_id": "52f848b5c4d10454444c9794", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2097419, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Comparative analysis of haploid next-generation re-sequencing data", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Unix Shell", "shortname": "shell", "fullname": "Unix Shell", "id": 185}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
