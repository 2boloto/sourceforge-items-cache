In addition S4P supports sprite image animation and pixel level transparency (see the ghost example). A sprite's movement can be defined in terms of speed, acceleration and direction leaving S4P to take care of the movement for you. Once moving then sprites can collide - S4P has 4 collision detection modes of varying speed and accuracy.\r\n\r\nS4P considers all sprites created move inside a single infinite 2D space called the world and the user can set the boundaries of the world to display and then zoom in and out of the display.
