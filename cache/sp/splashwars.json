Each has their own super splasher technique. Very much comparable to Mortal Combat strengths, agilities, & secret codes for secret shows. There are 4 main themes. Backyard pool, Lake house, Oceanside & indoor pool @ the local YMCA. This is a family game, so no blood, no iffy language, however some innuendoes may be considered. Characters include Chrystal Cannonball - (Cannonball queen)\r\nLarry the Lawnmower-Blade chop with mower through water\r\nBobby Bandana-Whips bandana in circular motion, repeatedly splashing water in face\r\nJunkman Jason -Tosses trash out of can he wears on head, all over. Scare tactic more than anything. If any germs touch the other player they start losing strength\r\nSpencer Sprinkler-Holds a gallon of water in his mouth & spritz it out like a sprinkler\r\nLinka Sync-Can stop time for 5-7 seconds while dashing splashes & preparing her own\r\nTippy Hose-Kinks hose for added splash\r\nJessie Wetsy-Pees in pool if excited", "shortname": "splashwars", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "twitter.com/iamaurl", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://facebook.com/maizeminor", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Not such a dry party after all!
