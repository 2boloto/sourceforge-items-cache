That way typically only a small, recently modified evolving chunk needs to be repeatedly uploaded to uC during time-consuming development stage.\r\n\r\nThe method is a significant improvement over a classic build style when the firmware upload takes more than ~5 seconds (above ~16kiB of flash with ST-Link/V2).\r\n\r\nThe link-time partitioning process is transparent and is based on several policies to choose from. The choice of a policy is a trade-off in between the burden of reprogramming and the flexibility of changes to make. These span from release-like policies where single modification requires full flashing to some that allow convenient 3s update even after major tweaks.\r\n\r\nThe example given is a complete Eclipse CDT project (gcc-arm-embedded), configured for STM32L-Discovery + OpenOCD and can be tailored to any architecture or IDE", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "splitcode", "_id": "52d72fbc7929e56d49edf2a5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2074326, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "Firmware rebuild and update uC in under 3 seconds", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
