That way typically only a small, recently modified evolving chunk needs to be repeatedly uploaded to uC during time-consuming development stage.\r\n\r\nThe method is a significant improvement over a classic build style when the firmware upload takes more than ~5 seconds (above ~16kiB of flash with ST-Link/V2).\r\n\r\nThe link-time partitioning process is transparent and is based on several policies to choose from. The choice of a policy is a trade-off in between the burden of reprogramming and the flexibility of changes to make. These span from release-like policies where single modification requires full flashing to some that allow convenient 3s update even after major tweaks.\r\n\r\nThe example given is a complete Eclipse CDT project (gcc-arm-embedded), configured for STM32L-Discovery + OpenOCD and can be tailored to any architecture or IDE", "shortname": "splitcode", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Firmware rebuild and update uC in under 3 seconds", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2074326}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/splitcode/", "video_url": null}
