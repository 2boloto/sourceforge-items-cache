This spike detecting application (recount2) is not bothered by such unwanted fluctuations.\r\n\r\nIt takes a running average (of any size) and compares the average with a 4 points after the current position. If it satisfies a primary threshold condition, it checks another 4 points forward in time and checks if a second threshold condition is met. This way, the detector picks up only a spike of a desired shape.\r\n\r\nresize: downscale data resampler\r\nrecount2: spike detector with 2-point sampling", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "spikedetector", "_id": "501a1356b9363c4c59000064", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 842183, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Action potential detection from extracellular recording", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
