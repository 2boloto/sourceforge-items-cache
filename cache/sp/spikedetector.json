This spike detecting application (recount2) is not bothered by such unwanted fluctuations.\r\n\r\nIt takes a running average (of any size) and compares the average with a 4 points after the current position. If it satisfies a primary threshold condition, it checks another 4 points forward in time and checks if a second threshold condition is met. This way, the detector picks up only a spike of a desired shape.\r\n\r\nresize: downscale data resampler\r\nrecount2: spike detector with 2-point sampling", "shortname": "spikedetector", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Action potential detection from extracellular recording", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 842183}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/spikedetector/", "video_url": ""}
