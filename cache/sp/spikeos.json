Each microthread is conceptually similar to a task in Ada and it is much lighter weight than an operating system thread. SpikeOS was designed to handle millions of microthreads, for example in a neural network hosting millions of spiking model neurons. \r\n\r\nSpikeOS handles microthread scheduling, synchronization, distribution and communication.\r\n\r\n*** This project has been forked. NeuraNEP (sourceforge.net/projects/neuranep) represents a major update to SpikeOS. It has the same core functionality plus several enhancements, including a scripting interface. NeuraNEP is engineering-oriented, as opposed to simulation-oriented, and some features/capabilities have changed.", "shortname": "spikeos", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 511206}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/spikeos/", "video_url": null}
