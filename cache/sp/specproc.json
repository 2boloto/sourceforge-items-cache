But hey, a small price to pay. They can only ever have a few things in them anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecProc is a general processing tool for MassLynx data. With you can query spectra and ask questions about the data\u2019s intensity, resolution and mass difference. To some of the queries you can attach pass/fail criteria. \r\n\r\nSpecProc\u2019s results can be viewed in a Internet Explorer for easy reading and printing. \r\n\r\nWritten in VB6 many many years ago it still works just fine on the latest Masslynx versions.\r\nAll the interaction is through the MassLynx DACServer dll. If this is working then SpecProc is working.\r\n\r\nThe one thing it can't do is different mass lists per peak.
