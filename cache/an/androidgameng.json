Apartment model with message passing.\r\nThe drawing cycle is inverted from typical game loops.  Framerate has a dedicated timer, and SurfaceView is in on-demand rendering mode.\r\nGame Objects (GOs) opt-in to services by implementing the \"marker\" interface for each one it wants.\r\nGOs enter the system via Install Pipeline, an asynchronous \"standard\" implementation that keys on the marker interfaces and performs the \"protocol\" for that marker.  There are also Event and Uninstall pipelines.\r\nReference by name is encouraged.
