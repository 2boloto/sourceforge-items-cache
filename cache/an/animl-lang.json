One of the defining features will be to implement constraint-based image definition.\r\n\r\nThis project includes both the AniML specification (for now) and (hopefully) a reference implementation and some guides on how to use it.\r\n\r\nAniML's ultimate goal is to eliminate the use of raster images in multimedia applications, or at least to provide a means of doing so, and instead permit the utilization of pure-vector animated graphics in all multimedia.
