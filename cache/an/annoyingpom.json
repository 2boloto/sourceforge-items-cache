This means the executable is rather large and it has a fairly long loading time.  But once it's running it does not use much resources.\r\n\r\nThe default zip has a 32-bit Windows executable, sound files, the config file, and the Perl source.", "summary": "A pomodoro timer with several options that keeps beeping when done.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1452403, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "annoyingpom", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rsuri/", "username": "rsuri", "name": "Ravi"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/annoyingpom/screenshot/screen.jpg", "caption": "Expanded and compact program, with options screen.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/annoyingpom/screenshot/screen.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Tk", "fullname": "Tk", "shortname": "ui_tk", "id": 478}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Perl", "fullname": "Perl", "shortname": "perl", "id": 176}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "id": 868}], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
