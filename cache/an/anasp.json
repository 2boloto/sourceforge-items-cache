In particular, it has been extensively established that multicellular spheroids are an efficient model to validate effects of drugs and treatments for human care applications. However, a lack of methods for quantitative analysis, limits the usage of spheroids as model for routine experiments. AnaSP is a suite tool for automatic analysis of morphological parameters of spheroids starting by brightfield images manually acquired with a standard widefield microscope. AnaSP is distributed as an open source software tool, and its modular architecture and graphical user interface make it attractive also for non-Computer Scientist people, and suitable for both high content screenings and occasional spheroid-based experiments.\r\n\r\nRequirements: MATLAB 2009b (32-bit) and Image Processing Toolbox 8.1 or later versions.", "summary": "AnaSP, a MATLAB software suite to ANAlyse SPheroids' parameters", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2311365, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/BiMzfpKncdc?rel=0", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "anasp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/piccila/", "username": "piccila", "name": "piccila"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/anasp/screenshot/AnaSP_MainWindow.jpg", "caption": "AnaSP, main window screenshot", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/anasp/screenshot/AnaSP_MainWindow.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://anasp.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "id": 230}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "fullname": "MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "id": 626}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}]}}
