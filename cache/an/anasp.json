In particular, it has been extensively established that multicellular spheroids are an efficient model to validate effects of drugs and treatments for human care applications. However, a lack of methods for quantitative analysis, limits the usage of spheroids as model for routine experiments. AnaSP is a suite tool for automatic analysis of morphological parameters of spheroids starting by brightfield images manually acquired with a standard widefield microscope. AnaSP is distributed as an open source software tool, and its modular architecture and graphical user interface make it attractive also for non-Computer Scientist people, and suitable for both high content screenings and occasional spheroid-based experiments.\r\n\r\nRequirements: MATLAB 2009b (32-bit) and Image Processing Toolbox 8.1 or later versions.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "anasp", "_id": "53fad90cd46bb4143797d50c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2311365, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "AnaSP, a MATLAB software suite to ANAlyse SPheroids' parameters", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
