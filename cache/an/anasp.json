In particular, it has been extensively established that multicellular spheroids are an efficient model to validate effects of drugs and treatments for human care applications. However, a lack of methods for quantitative analysis, limits the usage of spheroids as model for routine experiments. AnaSP is a suite tool for automatic analysis of morphological parameters of spheroids starting by brightfield images manually acquired with a standard widefield microscope. AnaSP is distributed as an open source software tool, and its modular architecture and graphical user interface make it attractive also for non-Computer Scientist people, and suitable for both high content screenings and occasional spheroid-based experiments.\r\n\r\nRequirements: MATLAB 2009b (32-bit) and Image Processing Toolbox 8.1 or later versions.", "shortname": "anasp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "AnaSP, a MATLAB software suite to ANAlyse SPheroids' parameters", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2311365}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/anasp/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/BiMzfpKncdc?rel=0"}
