To address this situation, I developed andIsis (from the excellent software coLinux and andLinux) to bring Isis 3.3.1 to Windows via \r\n1) a wizard-style setup executable\r\n2) visually seamless, hybrid virtualization of a Linux kernel\r\n3) a feature-rich utility to communicate with the Linux shell\r\n4) an interface for managing Isis 3\r\n\r\nThe result is a completely out-of-the-box end user experience comparable to that on any platform that natively supports Isis; the ability to call both Windows and Linux software, like Isis, from a single script; and cooperative management of system resources that is superior to traditional virtualization and perhaps even more efficient.\r\n\r\n32-bit Alpha ETA: fall 2012\r\n64-bit Alpha ETA: early 2013 (?)", "summary": "andIsis brings the USGS's Isis 3 to Windows via hybrid virtualization!", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 803246, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "andisis", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/eischaefer/", "username": "eischaefer", "name": "Ethan Schaefer"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/andisis/screenshot/Screenshot2%20%28cropped%29.jpg", "caption": "andIsis on Windows 7.
