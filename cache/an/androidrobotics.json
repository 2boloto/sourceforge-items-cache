Recently, I used the same code with some modification to control a robot using my android mobile. This app communicate with a program ( written in C )  running on the \" pandaboard\" with socket. The communication is based on the TCP/IP protocol. For this release, I just use the basic control for the robot ( Forward, Backward, Turn Left, Turn Right and Stop ). The list ( yaw, pitch ) does nothing. The value field can be used to send direct combination ( in my case I use the number \"1\" for Forward, \"2\" for Backward, \"3\" for Turn Left, \"4\" for Turn Right and \"5\" for Stop ). The last text field was created to display the information from \"Urbi\" server, but I don't need it in this case, so I eliminated.
