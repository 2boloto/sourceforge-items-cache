It strives to be a simple-to-use text-graphical toolkit have with an intuitive interface for developers, while maintaining a sufficiently high degree of flexibility.\r\n\r\nMany comparable APIs tend to either use video hardware, or are simply not as fully-featured as one might hope or expect, at least in the area of visual elements.  AnsiGL can serve to bridge that gap easier, and since it \"renders\" to a std::string (or optionally, an ncurses WINDOW *), integration should be relatively easy with just about any project.  Bindings to ncurses are provided to allow for rapid, fully-featured application development with old and familiar friends, along with AnsiGL.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ansigl", "_id": "4f0e9fd30594ca4e2e0007ce", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 667398, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A modern \"graphics\" API for text-based applications", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Terminals", "shortname": "terminals", "fullname": "Terminals", "id": 156}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Console-based Games", "shortname": "console-games", "fullname": "Console-based Games", "id": 633}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics", "shortname": "graphics", "fullname": "Graphics", "id": 100}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a graphics toolkit", "shortname": "ui_meta_toolkit", "fullname": "Project is a graphics toolkit", "id": 467}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
