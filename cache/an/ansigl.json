It strives to be a simple-to-use text-graphical toolkit have with an intuitive interface for developers, while maintaining a sufficiently high degree of flexibility.\r\n\r\nMany comparable APIs tend to either use video hardware, or are simply not as fully-featured as one might hope or expect, at least in the area of visual elements.  AnsiGL can serve to bridge that gap easier, and since it \"renders\" to a std::string (or optionally, an ncurses WINDOW *), integration should be relatively easy with just about any project.  Bindings to ncurses are provided to allow for rapid, fully-featured application development with old and familiar friends, along with AnsiGL.\r\n", "shortname": "ansigl", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A modern \"graphics\" API for text-based applications", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 667398}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ansigl/", "video_url": ""}
