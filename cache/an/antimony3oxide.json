It is the most\r\nimportant compound of antimony. It is found in nature as the minerals valentinite and\r\nsenarmontite. Antimony trioxide dissolves in aqueous solutions only with hydrolysis.\r\nAntimony trioxide is an amphoteric oxide, It can be readily oxidized to antimony\r\npentoxide and related antimony (V) compounds, but it is also easily reduced to\r\nantimony, sometimes with production of stibine  antimony trioxide is often used in\r\ncombination with halogenated compounds. Antimony trioxide is used as a synergist to\r\nenhance the activity of the halogenated flame retardant.\r\n", "summary": "Antimony trioxide is the inorganic compound with the formula Sb2O3.
