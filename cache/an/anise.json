Anise contains some ready-to-use implementations for some tasks (like\r\nbuilding binaries via qmake, debian and some other packages, svn interaction, doxygen, ...), so you can directly\r\nuse it.\r\n\r\nYour part is to create a *project description* file, which contains all project metadata and\r\ncustom implementations of some tasks.", "shortname": "anise", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "one software project administration tool for all environments", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2455980}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/anise/", "video_url": null}
