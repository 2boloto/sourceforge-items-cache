Please be nice.\r\n\r\nANDROIDER is a derivative of Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nI took the Ubuntu Mini Remix, stripped it to bare bones, then added an uber basic window manager, an ancient login manager, a wireless manager and browser that only run in the command line, and the prerequisites needed to build the AOSP. It limps along, has configuration errors and bugs up the wahazoo still, and wants to die at every turn. Oh, and the partition manager is command line only as well.\r\n\r\nDepending on the version you download, it can build either FroYo and older, or Gingerbread and newer. You won't need to download Repo either.\r\n\r\nAs I figure everything out, I'll be adding help documents and such. Don't expect much fast, though.\r\n\r\nNote: I will put updates on the blog, where I should have been putting them all along.
