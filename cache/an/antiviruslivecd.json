It's designed for system admins who need a lightweight live CD with an antivirus scanner. Both Ethernet (including Wi-Fi) and dial-up (including fast USB modems) Internet connections are supported to enable automatic updates of the virus signature database. All partitions are mounted automatically during boot so that they can be scanned by ClamAV (the supported filesystems are: btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, FAT, HFS, HFS+, jfs, Minix, NTFS, ReiserFS, and XFS). Antivirus Live CD images are fully compatible with UNetbootin, which can be used to create an easy-to-use Antivirus Live USB.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "antiviruslivecd", "_id": "4fe033810594ca75950000d7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 799055, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "donate", "name": "link", "label": "Donate"}], "summary": "4MLinux fork including ClamAV scanner", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Anti-Virus", "shortname": "antivirus", "fullname": "Anti-Virus", "id": 744}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Framebuffer", "shortname": "ui_framebuffer", "fullname": "Framebuffer", "id": 474}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "id": 866}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
