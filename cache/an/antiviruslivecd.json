It's designed for system admins who need a lightweight live CD with an antivirus scanner. Both Ethernet (including Wi-Fi) and dial-up (including fast USB modems) Internet connections are supported to enable automatic updates of the virus signature database. All partitions are mounted automatically during boot so that they can be scanned by ClamAV (the supported filesystems are: btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, FAT, HFS, HFS+, jfs, Minix, NTFS, ReiserFS, and XFS). Antivirus Live CD images are fully compatible with UNetbootin, which can be used to create an easy-to-use Antivirus Live USB.", "shortname": "antiviruslivecd", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "4MLinux fork including ClamAV scanner", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 799055}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/antiviruslivecd/", "video_url": ""}
