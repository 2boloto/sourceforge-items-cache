The output is going to be a text version of the plate number. Then it is going to retrieve that number from a database and get the information of the vehicle owner.\r\nNote: please note that you need emgucv installed. you also need to move the project files to:\r\nC:\\Emgu\\emgucv-windows-x86XXX\\Emgu.CV.Example\\", "shortname": "anpr", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "ANPR for National Borders Systems", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 657282}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/anpr/", "video_url": ""}
