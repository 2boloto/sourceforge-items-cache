The output is going to be a text version of the plate number. Then it is going to retrieve that number from a database and get the information of the vehicle owner.\r\nNote: please note that you need emgucv installed. you also need to move the project files to:\r\nC:\\Emgu\\emgucv-windows-x86XXX\\Emgu.CV.Example\\", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "anpr", "_id": "4efc59a7b9363c412e000eb9", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 657282, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "ANPR for National Borders Systems", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "id": 12}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "shortname": "security", "fullname": "Security", "id": 43}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "id": 133}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Academic Free License (AFL)", "shortname": "afl", "fullname": "Academic Free License (AFL)", "id": 324}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Microsoft SQL Server", "shortname": "db_net_mssql", "fullname": "Microsoft SQL Server", "id": 530}], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
