This includes features for file managing, video surveillance via webcam and desktop sharing. You can send remote commands, both predefined and custom from command line. We can obtain all the information on the machine, such as installed hardware and more. To develop this application was chosen Java because it is the programming language with which I have more experience, portability is also the basic requirement of this project, and thanks to the use of Java will be possible to administer a computer regardless of the system operating where you run the client or the server. The first version will be composed of several key features:\r\n\r\n     Ability to browse the remote file system\r\n     Upload / Download files\r\n     Basic operations on remote files\r\n     Monitor the remote screen\r\n", "shortname": "antessioqwerty", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Qwerty is an opensource remote administrator tool ", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "source", "mount_point": "source", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 712642}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/antessioqwerty/", "video_url": ""}
