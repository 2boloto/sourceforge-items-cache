The power of the anthill as a whole, exceeds the sum of the powers of the individual ants. This is what the AntHillOS plans to be. \r\n\r\nThe vision includes multiple interconnected devices. The devices can be connected either wirelessly or through any other means. To start with only ethernet connections will be supported. The OS will natively support parallelism between more than one node in the network. \r\n\r\nServices are discovered in runtime, with the nodes broadcasting their statuses when they come up. Periodic polling will be done to discover the nodes that go down. \r\n\r\nThere will be a module to split calculations into sub parts. This will be responsible for splitting the calculation into multiple sub-calculations and ensuring that the results are assembled in the right order.\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "anthillos", "_id": "507e85ef0594ca1070d37a12", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1032022, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "AnthillOS - a fully distributed OS for complex math calculations.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
