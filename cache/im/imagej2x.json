It can display, edit, analyze, process, save and print 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit images.  There can be many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, PNG, FITS and \"raw\" and ... Read and supports \"stacks\" (stack), a series of images that share a single window.\r\nThe program supports simultaneous that number of windows (images), limited only by available memory. It is multithreaded, so that time-consuming operations such as reading lists in parallel with other operations are performed. It can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selection. It can measure distances and angles. It can record density histograms and line profiles. It supports standard image processing functions such as contrast manipulation, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection and filtering it through all kinds of geometric transformations such as Zoom in / out and rotation. Images can be enlarged up to 32:1", "shortname": "imagej2x", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "2012", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 673064}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/imagej2x/", "video_url": ""}
