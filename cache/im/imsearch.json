Or perhaps sometimes you want to locate a paragraph using some keywords, but the keywords are not strictly connected. How would you cope with these situations? Usually, you have to painfully search the first pattern and look around and find the second pattern.\r\nTherefore I feel necessary to introduce an improvement in the searching functionality in Emacs: Emacs Imsearch --- Emacs Incremental Multiple-Pattern Search. Using imsearch, when you want to locate a line with multiple keywords, you simply type all the keywords, seperated by spaces. It is guaranteed that you will almost immediately find the desired line.  Also, all of the keywords will be highlighted.  In practice, 200% faster pattern localization is expected.\r\nOne-key switch between IMsearch and emacs default Isearch is also provided. \r\n", "shortname": "imsearch", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A better isearch for Emacs", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 890987}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/imsearch/", "video_url": ""}
