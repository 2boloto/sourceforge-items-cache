In the present version the project allows one to solve an infinite system of matrix equations which arises in the theory of stability preserving structural transformations of systems of second-order ODEs (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1814).\r\n\r\nThe project \"Nonlinear Stourm-Liouville Problems with Distribution Potentials\" is developed for solving nonlinear Sturm-Liouville problems with integrable potentials including Dirac delta function.  The numerical-analytical  method used in the project is called the FD-method. It was first proposed by Professor V.L.Makarov in 1991.To learn more about the problems of such type and the FD-method see, for example, http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2540.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "imathsoft", "_id": "4f8ebdd31be1ce3bff000521", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 751483, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "The software for solving special problems of mathematics and physics ", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics", "shortname": "graphics", "fullname": "Graphics", "id": 100}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics :: 3D Rendering", "shortname": "3drendering", "fullname": "3D Rendering", "id": 110}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics", "shortname": "mathematics", "fullname": "Mathematics", "id": 98}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Object Pascal", "shortname": "objectpascal", "fullname": "Object Pascal", "id": 258}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: OpenGL", "shortname": "ui_opengl", "fullname": "OpenGL", "id": 475}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
