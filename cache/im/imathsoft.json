In the present version the project allows one to solve an infinite system of matrix equations which arises in the theory of stability preserving structural transformations of systems of second-order ODEs (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1814).\r\n\r\nThe project \"Nonlinear Stourm-Liouville Problems with Distribution Potentials\" is developed for solving nonlinear Sturm-Liouville problems with integrable potentials including Dirac delta function.  The numerical-analytical  method used in the project is called the FD-method.
