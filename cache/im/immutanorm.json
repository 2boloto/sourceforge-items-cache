It is an implementation of structure and pattern that optimised for distribution and immutable referencing. \r\n\r\nThe idea being that if you can absolutely trust the content of a reference not changing from the time it is referenced; you can store that chunk anywhere and build many layers upon it. There is a complexity overhead in representing data in this form. The advantage comes with more layers of reference and many common references.\r\n\r\nSecondly having a relatively simple consistent representation of normalised data allows the possibility of programmatic semantic exploration of the data.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "immutanorm", "_id": "4f4e923d1be1ce0659000732", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 710822, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Immutable ultra-normalised distributed data structure.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Formats and Protocols :: Data Formats", "shortname": "data_formats", "fullname": "Data Formats", "id": 554}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Database", "shortname": "database", "fullname": "Database", "id": 66}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V3.0", "shortname": "ccaslv3", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V3.0", "id": 870}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
