It is an implementation of structure and pattern that optimised for distribution and immutable referencing. \r\n\r\nThe idea being that if you can absolutely trust the content of a reference not changing from the time it is referenced; you can store that chunk anywhere and build many layers upon it. There is a complexity overhead in representing data in this form. The advantage comes with more layers of reference and many common references.\r\n\r\nSecondly having a relatively simple consistent representation of normalised data allows the possibility of programmatic semantic exploration of the data.\r\n", "shortname": "immutanorm", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Immutable ultra-normalised distributed data structure.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 710822}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/immutanorm/", "video_url": ""}
