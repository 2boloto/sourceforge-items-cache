The program\r\nalso works in reverse. Given an permutation index, width, height and colour depth the image\r\ncan be reconstructed.\r\nThe aim of this was to see if there was a relationship with the permutation index and similar\r\nimages. For example, imagine consecutive frames of a movie: would these keys be spaced\r\nrandomly or would there be a pattern. Similary, if you took a photo of your face every year,\r\ncould you find a formula to relate all these images to find the next in the sequence, and could\r\nthe same formula be applied to other photos to produce similar results?", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "imagepermutator", "_id": "4f8a028ab9363c48ea000c9b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 748406, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Convert images to permutation indexs and visa-versa", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "shortname": "mingw_msys", "fullname": "MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "id": 445}]}}
