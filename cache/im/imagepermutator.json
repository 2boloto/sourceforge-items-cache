The program\r\nalso works in reverse. Given an permutation index, width, height and colour depth the image\r\ncan be reconstructed.\r\nThe aim of this was to see if there was a relationship with the permutation index and similar\r\nimages. For example, imagine consecutive frames of a movie: would these keys be spaced\r\nrandomly or would there be a pattern. Similary, if you took a photo of your face every year,\r\ncould you find a formula to relate all these images to find the next in the sequence, and could\r\nthe same formula be applied to other photos to produce similar results?", "shortname": "imagepermutator", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Convert images to permutation indexs and visa-versa", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 748406}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/imagepermutator/", "video_url": ""}
