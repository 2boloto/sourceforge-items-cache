On the one hand you want those better looking graphical headlines, on the other hand the maintenance effort \u2026 puhh! - There are two solutions for this problem: the first uses Flash, which uses the GET parameter to display the correct text. The second ist the solution with automatically created images. And this is what this plugin exactly does (btw., all graphical headlines on this website were created by this plugin). - This plugin uses its own cache. If you change the text or an attribute of a headline, its image is recreated. Otherwise it will be loaded from cache.\" CE\r\n\r\nOriginal version by Christoph Cerdmann (CE).
