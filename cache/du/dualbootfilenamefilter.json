Even burning discs can be tiresome, if they have to be readable in both environments.\r\n\r\nCommon disc burning programs are able to rename your files if their name do not match the expectations of the wanted file system, but they usually do not list the problematic files for you to rename them manually. \r\n\r\nThis program checks your files if they meet the expectations of various file systems. The aim is to develop a program which is not only able to list the problematic files, but even to rename them according to your own rules.
