Its main intention is to provide a sustainable and consistent framework for the implementation and application of model concepts, constitutive relations, discretizations, and solvers. It has been successfully applied to CO2 storage scenarios, environmental remediation problems, transport of therapeutic agents through biological tissue, and subsurface-atmosphere coupling.
