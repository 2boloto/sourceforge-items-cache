Various solvers can be plugged in to use the data to solve for whatever systems are needed.  \r\n\r\nA user is basically gives various configuration data about the problem domain and subdomains , from which appropriate grids are created and then the user is provided with an object with functions to the manage the domain and various subdomains of the problem and to faciliatate management and operations on data.", "shortname": "dunesimulation", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A Hybrid Multiphysics Simulation Library", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 619465}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dunesimulation/", "video_url": ""}
