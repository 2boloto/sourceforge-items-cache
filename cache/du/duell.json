Imagine a chess board, but replace the figures by dice. Instead of moving the dice, they are flipped around the board according to their value, obeying the rules of chess. And, you got it, they change their power as they change the number of pips!\r\n\r\nThis 'Duell' software project allows two players to challenge each other, or a single player to get challenged by the computer. Try it, but don't get yourself frustrated too fast!\r\n\r\nThis software has been created and developed by Roland Studer 1985-2010. That year Roland left us way too young and I decided to keep Roland's work and spirit alive, in accordance with the will of his widow. This SourceForge project shall be alive in memory of Roland.\r\n\r\n'Duell' is also known as 'Tactix'.
