The original Equity was created to facilitate the need to convert other model formats to its format and display as much information as it could and be able to Edit the Model namely Textures and Motions.\r\n\r\nThings have moved on now with the advent of better video cards and rendering techniques and one Graphics Engine that combines all this is the Ogre Engine.\r\n\r\nSo we have deicide to change our rendering  to Ogre and Support the Ogre model format as much as we can but still be useful to RealityFactory users as well as Ogre User.\r\n\r\nEquity_XL is still in development as we transfer the functionality of the original Equity and add better support for the Ogre format.
