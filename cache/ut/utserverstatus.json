This does not require recon privileges, since most players do not have this level of access. The motivation for its creation was to eliminate the need to wait around on a server waiting for other players to join.  This program makes it possible to monitor the server while browsing the web or even while away from the computer entirely.  The program sends a notification popup to the OS when the server is active with players and also plays a short beep audio clip to get your attention if you are away from the computer.  By entering your ut player name into the program you can ensure the program will not be triggered by your presence on the server, so you can join the server and safely minimize until another player joins without worrying about missing the moment when they join the server.
