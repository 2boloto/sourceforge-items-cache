It provides development libraries, interface applications, mass configuration tools, front-end and back-end applications.\r\n\r\nopenSCADA is ready to rock. It is used 24/7 in several installations around this world.\r\n\r\nopenSCADA is supported. So if you prefer a fully supported, out of the box instead of a \u201cbuild it yourself\u201d solution you can contact IBH SYSTEMS GmbH and let us do the job. If you like, you will still get the source code that was developed specially for you.\r\n\r\nopenSCADA needs you. Writing source code, writing documentation, fixing bugs or providing fresh input.
