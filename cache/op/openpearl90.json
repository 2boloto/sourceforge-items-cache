PEARL is an abbreviation for \"(P)rocess and (E)xperiment (A)utomation (R)ealtime (L)anguage\".\r\nIt was designed around 1975 at the IRT Institute of the Leibniz University in Hannover with the idea in mind to have an easy to learn programming language for realtime problems. For more, also historical information please visit (http://www.irt.uni-hannover.de/pearl/).\r\nIn 1998 PEARL-90 was standardized by the Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung e.V. in DIN 66253-2.\r\nPEARL provides the standard data types and structures known from other procedural languages like e.g. PASCAL.\r\nAdditionally PEARL brings special language constructs for managing real-time and multitasking tasks.\r\n\r\nPlease note: The active Project-Website is https://sourceforge.net/projects/smallpearl/ !", "shortname": "openpearl90", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Compiler development for PEARL90", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2160404}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/openpearl90/", "video_url": null}
