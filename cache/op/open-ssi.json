It supports streaming from multiple sensors and includes mechanisms for their synchronization. In particularly SSI supports the machine learning pipeline in its full length and offers a graphical interface that assists a user to collect own training corpora and obtain personalized models. It also suits the fusion of multimodal information at different stages including early and late fusion.
