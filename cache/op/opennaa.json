NAA process can be hypothetically divided and explained in three parts. First step is the sample preparation and logging. The second step is the exposure of the samples in a neutron field. The final step is the measurement of the radiation released from the irradiated samples and analysis for elemental quantification and qualification. Simple GUI should allow operators to perform routine data acquisition and analysis for standard reference material measurements. The GUI will be a web based application accessible from major operating systems. Allow each NAA calculation run to accommodate: Greater than or equal to 100 different standards in one analysis batch. Multiple standards with the same nuclides. Multiple standards that each has different nuclides. Allow the user to designate the irradiation time (end of irradiation) for each spectrum.
