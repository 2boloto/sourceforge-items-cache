So far, only the tools, and only a data replication tool, Optimal Sync, has been released (available from the \"files\" page). But more is coming.\r\n\r\nIt incorporates many different open source projects that relates to interoperability, transformation, context and process control. \r\n\r\nIt has no business engine, instead it generates Python code and leaves the engine mechanics to its scripting engine. This enables it to:\r\n* be very flexible\r\n* be truly multi-platform\r\n* draw from all the features available to the language and its sprawling ecosystem\r\n* partake in that ecosystem as a library.\r\n\r\nIt has a strong focus on ease of use and low maintenance. Anyone should be able to get started with minimal outside(consultants) help and quickly get the system working. \r\n\r\nNote : Its sibling projects, QAL (https://sf.net/p/qal)", "shortname": "optimalbpm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "optimalbpm", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/optimalbpm", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The beat of your business", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 223470}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/optimalbpm/", "video_url": null}
