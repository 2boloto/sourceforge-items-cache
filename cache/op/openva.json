Alongside with methods that have been used in APT before (iso-surfaces, core-linkage\u2026) the distance to the center of mass within a subvolume can be used to delineate a feature where other methods fail. Using piecewise linear approximations of the features, new analysis methods can be applied based on a Voronoi tessellation of the dataset using the vertices from the approximations. \r\nWithin the subvolumes created by the Voronoi tessellation, local coordinate systems are defined based on the piecewise linear approximations, upon which the analysis is based on. This way, new analysis methods can be employed, such as the generalized feature excess.\r\nOpenVA is written in MATLAB code (at least for now), the first release is planned for May 2012. \r\n", "shortname": "openva", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "atom probe data analysis software", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 655705}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/openva/", "video_url": ""}
