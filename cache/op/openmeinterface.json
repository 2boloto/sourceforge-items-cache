It is based on successful Interactive Compilation Interface (ICI) which was added to mainline GCC >= 4.5. It supports C,C++,Fortran and Java. OpenME requires just one include file \"openme.h\" and 2 functions to register events or to have a call-back.\r\n\r\nThe usage of this interface is briefly described in an open access publication available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2410\r\n", "shortname": "openmeinterface", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "c_tuning", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "simple event-based plugin interface to open up hardwired software", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1892538}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/openmeinterface/", "video_url": ""}
