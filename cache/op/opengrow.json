Then I plan on adding features in subsequent releases. Then I'll probably end up rewriting all of the code and writing some documentation at the point where I have a good basic feature set.\r\n\r\nI will release new alphas every few weeks, containing source code and OS-specific binaries, unless I put development on hold for a while (see below).\r\n\r\nProject is currently ACTIVE. However, the next release is a complete remake of the existing code, so won't be around for a while.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you view the latest screenshots (slide to the right on the screenshot bar)!", "shortname": "opengrow", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "An open-source project to develop a plant generation tool.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 543387}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/opengrow/", "video_url": ""}
