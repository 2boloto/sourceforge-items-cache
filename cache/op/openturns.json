Targeted users are all engineers who want to introduce the probabilistic dimension in their so far deterministic studies. \r\n\r\n- a python module with high level operators in the probabilistic and statistical field. The interest of this language is to be both a powerful scientific language (capable of using C++ libraries), and a user friendly interpreted language like Matlab\u2019s one.
