As you know, these sites were seized by the FBI in early 2012, thus destroying all hosted material; both good and bad. This caused a lot of older ROMs, kernels, and even a script or two to disappear with it. During the making of the Vibrant Bible thread I discovered that even some of most popular ROMs had been hosted solely on Megaupload or Multiupload, and threads were now littered with dead download links as a result. So I went on a quest to hunt down these files. Some I had backed up on my own computer, some I was able to find with some in-depth googling, and for others I had to reach out to the community to find a copy. Once a missing file was obtained, I uploaded it here, where they will be hosted indefinitely.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vibrantbible", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/klmvibrant/", "username": "klmvibrant", "name": "N00B_IN_N33D"}], "external_homepage": "http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1982728"}
