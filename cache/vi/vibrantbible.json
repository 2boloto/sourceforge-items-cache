As you know, these sites were seized by the FBI in early 2012, thus destroying all hosted material; both good and bad. This caused a lot of older ROMs, kernels, and even a script or two to disappear with it. During the making of the Vibrant Bible thread I discovered that even some of most popular ROMs had been hosted solely on Megaupload or Multiupload, and threads were now littered with dead download links as a result. So I went on a quest to hunt down these files. Some I had backed up on my own computer, some I was able to find with some in-depth googling, and for others I had to reach out to the community to find a copy. Once a missing file was obtained, I uploaded it here, where they will be hosted indefinitely.\r\n", "shortname": "vibrantbible", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Repository of Files Mentioned in the Vibrant Bible.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1043589}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/vibrantbible/", "video_url": ""}
