The conceptual model and computer native code was developed by Rushton and Redshaw (1979), Rathod and Rusthon (1984 and 1992), and the graphical user interface was developed by our Group Member, the hydrogeologist No\u00e9l Hern\u00e1ndez Laloth.\r\n\r\nThe model, based on finite-difference approximations using the \u201ctwo-zone\u201d conceptual approach, can provide a greater flexibility than analytical methods, because the aquifer system is approximated as two horizontal permeable zones with less permeable intermediate layers. When this approximation is adopted, it is possible to represent both radial and vertical components of flow (Rathod and Rusthon, 1992). For this reason, the Visual TWZN is ideal of aquifer test interpretation using numerical methods.
