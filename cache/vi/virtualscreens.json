Any keyboard or mouse movement would then turn off the images being displayed, restoring the previous view of the computer, But the program would still be resident in memory, waiting to be executed again when a certain pc-idle time is reached. It will keep on doing this till it is uninstalled from memory.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "virtualscreens", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/msaads/", "username": "msaads", "name": "Muhammad Saad Siddiqui"}], "external_homepage": ""}
