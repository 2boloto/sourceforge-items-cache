It is completely event based making use of C++11 function handlers leading to compact, well arranged user application code. It features time based events to provide an easy to use full-duplex timeout and keepalive mechanism complementing its various implementations (raw, signal, timer, pair, file, fifo, uds, uart, tcp) of its protocol independend io interface. Unsafe signal handlers are replaced by callback functions being save against non-reentrant functions with the welcome side effect that system calls will never be interrupted. It is licensed under the AGPLv3 as published by the Free Software Foundation on 19 November 2007. The coding language is C++11 making use of object orientation and polymorphism. It is intended to work on all POSIX-compliant (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like) operating systems.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vio", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/qu1x/", "username": "qu1x", "name": "Rouven Spreckels"}], "external_homepage": "http://vio.nevux.org/"}
