The output is analysed and then put into a ranking table. Outputs will be ranked on a variety of factors (at present, only number of dictionary words in output are counted).\r\n\r\nFor the future:\r\nBetter key generation, trying combinations of dictionary words with numbers. If that fails, brute force will be used.\r\nFor all attempts of the dictionary attack, only keys within the known key length range will be generated.\r\nBetter ranking system and analysis of possible decoded messages.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe version currently released, I made in an evening! It is nowhere near ready for release but is a fun project to think about and I need more ideas for improvements mentioned above.\r\n\r\nDiscuss possible solutions and ideas!", "shortname": "vigdicattack", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Vigenere brute force / dictionary cracking tool", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1869457}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/vigdicattack/", "video_url": ""}
