People use their smart phones and tablets to take pictures and videos, leading to a high number of production places. If we enable those visitors to share their content at the event, new challenges emerge. Visitors move, go online and offline, and build a dynamic network. One can say a complex adaptive network emerges, with all its problems. We tackle these problems by introducing a bio-inspired algorithm, which lets the content place itself where it is needed. It is robust, scalable and adaptive. The transport path of content is exploited to replicate content and limited storage space is handled by clean-up mechanisms.\r\n\r\nWe implemented a simulator to show the algorithm's performance and to test its behavior under real circumstances. It is easily extendable to support several new scenarios or changes to the algorithm (see replication and client models).", "shortname": "videonetwork", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A simulator for self-organizing video replication and more", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2427506}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/videonetwork/", "video_url": null}
