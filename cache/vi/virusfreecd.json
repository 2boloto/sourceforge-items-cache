A Web browser included operating system loads pre-configured to your broadband connection.  This live CD turns a computer into a implementable fortress, immune from viruses or harm to files on the hard drive.  Browse the Internet and web-based applications with complete immunity.  When ready to return to Windows/Mac-OSX86, just turn off the computer, reboot and take out the CD.\r\n\r\nIt works via Knoppix Live-CD, except there is no write access to the hard drive.  It has been simplified and harden down to prevent attack.  If there is any, the only code will be in in the computer's RAM.  Once the computer is restarted, the RAM is cleared and there is no harm done.\r\n\r\nI spent a year trying to market it.  Now it's open source and I hope someone will be able to enjoy the many, many hours I spent on it.", "shortname": "virusfreecd", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Temporaly makes your computer immune to viruses or other harm", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2221210}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/virusfreecd/", "video_url": null}
