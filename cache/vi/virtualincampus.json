So, the variation exists between students knowledge in urban and rural area. To overcome this problem, we propose the solution called \u2018Cloud Campus \u2018which can be used in upcoming years because there will be no institutions beyond traditional classrooms based on cloud computing. The educational content can be delivering to people at their doorsteps through the Cloud Campus \u201cas a Service\u201d. It also makes possible the implementation of a Universal curriculum across the nation; enabling students across India acquire the same experience in education. Cloud Campus empowers the students to learn on their own terms at their own place, wherever and whenever they want it. By using Cloud Campus, learning process is not just limited to textbooks and enhanced through group learning.", "shortname": "virtualincampus", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "  This  project enhance virtualization concept in college campus.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Virtualization", "mount_point": "link", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 760513}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/virtualincampus/", "video_url": ""}
