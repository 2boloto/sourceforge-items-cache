Home Basic and Premium do not have it, hence the need for this program. It turns out in Windows 8 the feature has been deprecated. The tab is not available except by accessing the computer as if it were over a network. However Previous Version File Recoverer still works, as does an alternative piece of freeware named Shadow Explorer.\r\n\r\nThis version fixes a major flaw which prevented the recovery of files other than those saved on the operating system partition. \r\n\r\nThis program was previously known as Vista Previous Version File Recoverer and Windows Previous Version Recoverer.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vistaprevrsrcvr", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/socrtwo22/", "username": "socrtwo22", "name": "socrtwo22"}], "external_homepage": "http://godskingsandheroes.info/software/"}
