Or it synchronizes the folders and files under the selected folder on the remote host by either checking the consistency of the checksum, or comparing the last modified time and size of the file to be synchronized.\r\n\r\nXrsync uses Java implemented SSH API to ensure secure data transfer. So it works for any remote Linux host that runs a SSH daemon and a local Windows client that can login to the Linux host using an account with a home directory on that host.\r\n\r\nExecutable: Just download Xrsync.exe and run.\r\n\r\nPlugin for Eclipse: Download com.dj.srcRsync_1.0.0.*.jar and copy it to %eclipse%/plugins.
