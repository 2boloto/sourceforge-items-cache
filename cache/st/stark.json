The term was first coined by Alan Emrich in his September 1993 preview of Master of Orion for Computer Gaming World. Since then, others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and design.\r\n\r\n4X games are noted for their deep, complex gameplay. Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development, as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy. Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of micromanagement needed to sustain an empire scales as the empire grows. 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons, and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement with varying degrees of success.\"", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "stark", "_id": "4fc31efb1be1ce646d0001b7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 781026, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Turn Based Strategy", "shortname": "turnbasedstrategy", "fullname": "Turn Based Strategy", "id": 83}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Real Time Tactical", "shortname": "realtimetactical", "fullname": "Real Time Tactical", "id": 847}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PL/SQL", "shortname": "plsql", "fullname": "PL/SQL", "id": 254}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: OpenGL", "shortname": "ui_opengl", "fullname": "OpenGL", "id": 475}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
