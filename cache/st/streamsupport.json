In detail, static and default interface methods have been moved to companion classes in the same package that bear the identical name as the interface but with an \"s\" appended (e.g. Comparator -> Comparators).\r\n\r\nFor ease of use, the default methods for most of the functional interfaces were NOT retained as abstract methods in the redefined interfaces (keeping them single method interfaces) - the missing default (and static) methods can always be found in the corresponding companion class.\r\n\r\nWant also lambdas? https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "streamsupport", "_id": "536e14183e5e83705a4d0e45", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2220414, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Backport of Java 8 java.util.stream API to Java 6/7 and Android", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
