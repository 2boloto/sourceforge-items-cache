In detail, static and default interface methods have been moved to companion classes in the same package that bear the identical name as the interface but with an \"s\" appended (e.g. Comparator -> Comparators).\r\n\r\nFor ease of use, the default methods for most of the functional interfaces were NOT retained as abstract methods in the redefined interfaces (keeping them single method interfaces) - the missing default (and static) methods can always be found in the corresponding companion class.\r\n\r\nWant also lambdas? https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda", "shortname": "streamsupport", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Backport of Java 8 java.util.stream API to Java 6/7 and Android", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2220414}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/streamsupport/", "video_url": null}
