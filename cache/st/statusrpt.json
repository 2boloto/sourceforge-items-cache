Each activity was associated with a WBS line item, and the WBS line item was part of the overall departmental budget. In other words, time spent on Project X was given a WBS number, which was part of all the projects were responsible for completing. \r\n\r\nEven though Status Reporter was developed for a specific purpose, the ideals can be applied to almost any situation. For example, if your situation does not use WBS numbers, you could just create a single WBS number and associate all activities with the single WBS. Or if you have multiple projects, you can use the WBS numbers as individual projects and have one or more activities associated with each WBS. The WBS number does not have to be numeric, so it is flexible in its usage.", "shortname": "statusrpt", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Status-Reporter/107839686074117?fref=ts", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A time tracking application.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1389240}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/statusrpt/", "video_url": ""}
