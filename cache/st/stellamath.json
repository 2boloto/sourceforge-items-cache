He buys 10 more pencils. How many pencils does he have in all?\r\n2) There are 6 boys and 4 girls in a library. How many kids are there altogether?\r\n3) Bob ran 8 miles and Stella ran 2 miles. How many miles did they run altogether?\r\n4) What is the sum of 7 and 2?\r\n5) What is 8 divided by 2?\r\n6) What is the 10 subtracted by 2?\r\n7) What is 2 subtracted from 10?\r\n\r\nAlso shows users how answer was achieved.\r\nNominal user education level: 1st grade\r\nEducational software. Designed chiefly to aid elementary school students in the study of arithmetic word problems.\r\n\r\nThis software utilizes parts-of-speech tagging software that was\r\ndeveloped and published by the Natural Language Processing Group\r\nat Stanford University.
