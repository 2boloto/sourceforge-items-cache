There is growing evidence that transcriptional regulation is the complex behavior that emerges not solely from the individual components, but rather from their collective behavior, including competition and cooperation.\tOur framework describes individual regulatory components using generic action oriented descriptions of their biochemical interactions with a DNA sequence. All the possible actions are based on the current state of factors bound to the DNA. We developed a rule builder to automatically generate the complete set of biochemical interaction rules for any given DNA sequence. Off-the-shelf stochastic simulation engines can model the behavior of a system of rules and the resulting changes in the configuration of bound factors can be visualized.
