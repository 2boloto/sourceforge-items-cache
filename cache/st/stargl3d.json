FlightCraft3D anyway goes a lot beyond: is physically realistic, and allowes landing everywhere. It aims at becoming a game focused on casual landing, among trees, rocks and buildings and so on. \r\nVID:http://youtu.be/_Af0PgrCTxo\r\nIt shall be a sort of Minecraft-focused-on-aeromobilism. Simply implemented, but with many interesting features. I plan to do also a non-GL version that displays whole 3D gfx with a procedure at whose end pixels are displayed with SDL, asciiart, of native Linux X11 graphics of native Win graphics.  Ofc ourse OpenGL is very useful for displaying nice trees... .\r\nit's a single sourcefile program.  \r\n\r\nUSAGE: in any Linux/UNIX system (es.Ubuntu) download the zip and place it in your home directory; extract the zip. open a Terminal and navigate int the folder of the game;type this: \"make\";press ENTER; double-click the a.out", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "stargl3d", "_id": "50c9c61c5fcbc909b5717f8b", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 646178, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "realistic but simple flight simulator: exploration and casual landing", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Role-Playing", "shortname": "rpg", "fullname": "Role-Playing", "id": 84}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Simulation", "shortname": "simulation", "fullname": "Simulation", "id": 85}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Flight simulator", "shortname": "flightsim", "fullname": "Flight simulator", "id": 752}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: OpenGL", "shortname": "ui_opengl", "fullname": "OpenGL", "id": 475}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: SDL", "shortname": "ui_sdl", "fullname": "SDL", "id": 480}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
