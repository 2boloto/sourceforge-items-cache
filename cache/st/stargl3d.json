Simply implemented, but with many interesting features. I plan to do also a non-GL version that displays whole 3D gfx with a procedure at whose end pixels are displayed with SDL, asciiart, of native Linux X11 graphics of native Win graphics.  Ofc ourse OpenGL is very useful for displaying nice trees... .\r\nit's a single sourcefile program.  \r\n\r\nUSAGE: in any Linux/UNIX system (es.Ubuntu) download the zip and place it in your home directory; extract the zip. open a Terminal and navigate int the folder of the game;type this: \"make\";press ENTER; double-click the a.out", "shortname": "stargl3d", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "realistic but simple flight simulator: exploration and casual landing", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 646178}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/stargl3d/", "video_url": ""}
