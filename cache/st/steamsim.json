The time annotation engine annotates the C source \r\ncode used for simulation with the timing information as if the code is run on a \r\nmicrocontroller. The annotation process is fully automated.\r\n\r\nHardware models are developed using the PAWiS framework and reflect the timing, \r\nfunctionality, and energy-consumption of real-world hardware such as a CC2420 \r\nradio transceiver.\r\n\r\nNetwork behavior in terms of wireless channel models are provided by the PAWiS \r\nand the MiXiM framework.\r\n\r\nSTEAM-Sim is an extension to the PAWiS and MiXiM framework. The underlying \r\nsimulator is OMNeT++.
