In addition, a part of software (called StView\r\nver.1.0) was ported to a web-based GIS system (e.g., ProGIS) and ProVIP as a solution for\r\nstereo visualisation.\r\nApart from the stereo visualisation, some useful stereo tools (e.g., stereo matcher or stereo\r\nimage processing tools) have been extracted from UCL\u2019s previous development for HRSC\r\ndata processing, and modified for close-range stereo imagery.", "shortname": "stereows", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "StereoWS developed by UCL-MSSL within the ProVisG project", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 806149}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/stereows/", "video_url": ""}
