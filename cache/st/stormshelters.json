They are especially useful in those areas that experience a great deal of tornado activity, such as in the Midwest and  Southeastern portions of the United States. {For the most part there are usually two kinds: below ground and above ground. And while most people fall under the delusion that underground shelters are safer, this is oftentimes not the case. There has been no official data to date to suggest that underground shelters are safer and more reliable than above-ground storm shelters.|In fact, there seems to be more potential hazards with outdoor cellars than with indoor shelters. For instance, an outdoor below-ground cellar forces a person to go outside to seek shelter in the event of a tornado, hurricane, or storm.\r\n", "shortname": "stormshelters", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "https://twitter.com/stormshelters1", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/storm.shelters.5/", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1619428}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/stormshelters/", "video_url": ""}
