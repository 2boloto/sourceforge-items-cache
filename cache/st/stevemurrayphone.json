I realized how easy it is to speak SIP without a lot of classes or abstraction.  It is just plain-english SIP.  The SIP is copy-pasted from wireshark, and then just does replace of whatever characters need to be changed to make or answer a specific call.  I don't program, and pretty soon I will have thrown away all my hard drives with this code on it.  So I figured I would put my work somewhere in case someone needs a SIP video phone.  It has been used to make calls as an ActiveX plugin, but it is pretty easy to put inside a Mozilla/Chrome plugin to make browser-based calls from a web page as well.  You can drag-drop it as a control into any Windows program in Visual Studio.  Do what you want with it, but please don't bother me about it. I am not interested in SIP, VOIP, or programming.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "stevemurrayphone", "_id": "53ffb5f6485acd45ece861a9", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2313838, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "simple SIP video phone with h264, ulaw and g729", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
