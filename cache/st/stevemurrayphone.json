I realized how easy it is to speak SIP without a lot of classes or abstraction.  It is just plain-english SIP.  The SIP is copy-pasted from wireshark, and then just does replace of whatever characters need to be changed to make or answer a specific call.  I don't program, and pretty soon I will have thrown away all my hard drives with this code on it.  So I figured I would put my work somewhere in case someone needs a SIP video phone.  It has been used to make calls as an ActiveX plugin, but it is pretty easy to put inside a Mozilla/Chrome plugin to make browser-based calls from a web page as well.  You can drag-drop it as a control into any Windows program in Visual Studio.  Do what you want with it, but please don't bother me about it. I am not interested in SIP, VOIP, or programming.", "shortname": "stevemurrayphone", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "simple SIP video phone with h264, ulaw and g729", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2313838}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/stevemurrayphone/", "video_url": null}
