StrataGEM marries the well know concepts of Term Rewriting (TR) to the efficiency of Decision Diagrams (DDs). TR systems are a great way to describe the semantics of a system, being readable and compact, but their direct implementation tends to be rather slow on large sets of terms. On the other hand, DDs have demonstrated their efficiency for model-checking, but translating a system semantics into efficient DDs operations is an expert\u2019s matter. StrataGEM describes the semantics of a system in terms of strategies over a TR system, and automatically translates these rules into operations on DD to handle the model-checking. The ultimate goal of StrataGEM is to become a verification framework for the different variants of Petri nets by separating the semantics of the model from the computation that performs model-checking.", "shortname": "stratagem-mc", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Stratagem Model Checker", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1882371}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/stratagem-mc/", "video_url": null}
