StrayOS aims to be out-of-the-box ready full installation of Linux. Stable releases occur after Fedora stops updating and supporting the version. ISOs, when stable contain all of the upstream updates by default and should be stable enough for personal use without further official updates.\r\n\r\nStrayOS incorporates RPMfusion and programs not included in Fedora such as VLC (However will not include Adobe flash). StrayOS, while aiming to be lightweight does not forget people need to get work done! StrayOS is formatted as a LiveDVD, including the fully featured LibreOffice, Firefox and Thunderbird. \r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n*Still using generic icons\r\n*Remi repo not yet working - no Firefox  and Thunderbird 12.01+", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "strayos", "_id": "4f2fd3c2b9363c6fda000d1f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 686156, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A Fedora LXDE remix targetted at stability, ease of use and speed", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
