This site\r\nis what I am developing for my senior project and it is currently a work in progress.\r\nI will continue to update it as I move further along in the project. \r\n\r\nThis site will allow users to upload used textbooks to sell and allow them to buy\r\nbooks from other students. The website will also provide a feature for students\r\nto search an outside source for a specific book if the one they desire is not \r\navailable. This will be accomplished using Google's Custom Search API. \r\n\r\nAll of the associated source code is available for download. My website uses \r\nSmarty web templates to make the development more efficient. I currently do \r\nnot have a place to host my website since this is only for the sake of my class\r\nproject.
