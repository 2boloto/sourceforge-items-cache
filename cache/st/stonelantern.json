Then having to plant, wait for them to grow and harvest them.\r\nYou can't even place Jack-O-Lanterns without a block under them first. Who wants to look at that all of the time anyway?\r\n\r\n- Redstone Lanterns: You literally have to go to Hell (The Nether) and back to craft them.\r\nAnd they have to be powered by a Redstone Torch or a Switch. Too much of a pain to craft, and not Renewable.\r\n\r\nI hope Mojang adds this to Minecraft in a future update.\r\n\r\nPS: Source Code is also included in the zip files. :-)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "stonelantern", "_id": "504e88851be1ce14291d75ad", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 892766, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Open Source", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
