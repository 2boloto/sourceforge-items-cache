Then having to plant, wait for them to grow and harvest them.\r\nYou can't even place Jack-O-Lanterns without a block under them first. Who wants to look at that all of the time anyway?\r\n\r\n- Redstone Lanterns: You literally have to go to Hell (The Nether) and back to craft them.\r\nAnd they have to be powered by a Redstone Torch or a Switch. Too much of a pain to craft, and not Renewable.\r\n\r\nI hope Mojang adds this to Minecraft in a future update.\r\n\r\nPS: Source Code is also included in the zip files. :-)", "shortname": "stonelantern", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Open Source", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 892766}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/stonelantern/", "video_url": ""}
