Being a pure Java application, it works on Windows or Linux. Unlike the web-app Delicious, Stome doesn't store any data on a remote server. All data is stored in a local Sqlite3 database file, which has obvious privacy advantages. Savvy users may even choose to store data in multiple database files, which makes it easy to share tagged links with friends or associates. You can use a pendrive or a cloud server of your choice to take Stome and your Stome databases with you wherever you go. All the convenience of Delicious, but with privacy.\r\n\r\nPlease see the Wiki page for more information.\r\n\r\nUpcoming features to watch for:\r\n- Youtube tutorial videos\r\n- Export to database\r\n- Import links from local filesystem\r\n- Feeds (twitter, youtube, and rss)\r\n", "shortname": "stome", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A web link tagging and management application", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1961672}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/stome/", "video_url": null}
