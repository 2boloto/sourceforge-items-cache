At those times, the audience is left staring at a static screen.\r\n\r\nUse Stream Intermission to fix that! If you need to go somewhere, launch the program, and it will fill the entire screen. The background will smoothly change, and ambiance effects will randomly appear, such as rain or fireworks. It's nothing glamorous, but it certainly beats leaving your viewers in the dark, wouldn't you agree?\r\n\r\nOn top of that, a message scrolls by notifying your users that you're away. If you want, you can type your own message after opening the program, so that viewers can know exactly why you're gone, and estimate when you'll return.\r\n\r\nThere are also some extra features, like the ability to add your own music or a watermark.", "shortname": "streamintermission", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Need to pause while streaming?
