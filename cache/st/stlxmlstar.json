I was originally going to call it XMLite but that name was already taken by Microsoft.  The intent is to have a lightweight system.  It handles basic XML elements, attributes, comments and processes.  More complicated syntax is not supported.  For example, it can read a Microsoft word generated xml file but it can\u2019t save that text file back to XML for Microsoft to use.  However for simple XML it works fine.  It has also been used on some fairly large files for testing.
