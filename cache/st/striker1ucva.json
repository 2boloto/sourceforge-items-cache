Promotion of stand off weapons reduces the exposure of combat air planes to hostile fire. The idea is to put as much distance as possible between a pilot and dense defense encircling high value targets. The trend is certain to continue and, at some point specific types of aircraft likely will be removed from the battle entirely, with a collection of robotic craft taking their places in combat over the target. Current terminology for this system is \u201cUninhabited Combat Air vehicle\u201d. They may not only help save the lives of the pilot, but also provide more affordable and effective base to attack certain targets. This paper elaborates the inventive concepts, future role, deployment and missions of UCAV, which shows much potential for SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defense).\r\nThe motive behind building this project is to make an UCAV which can be carried in a college...", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "striker1ucva", "_id": "5063f89c1be1ce34b5010cb2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 983332, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "An effective UCAV will be enabled in the next century as the result.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
