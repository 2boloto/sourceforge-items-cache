A BitTorrent client is application that manages uploading and downloading of a torrent by following BitTorrent protocol, which is a peer to peer file sharing protocol used for distributing data of all size over internet. Besides basic operations of uploading and downloading some clients provide option to create torrent file on client system, so does StyxTorrent.StyxTorrent uses library named libtorrent (Arvid Norberg, Rasterbar Software) and Boost (Boost.org) to implement BitTorrent protocol which was very helpful as it reduced the development time and gave some air to work on BitTorrent client logic. Libtorrent & Boost are written in c++ and so is StyxTorrent. To be specific StyxTorrent in written in MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) and ATL (Active Template Library) which fall under Visual C++. MFC provides easy access to Windows API and some of wonderful features provided by Windows Operating System. Visual Studio 2008 was used as IDE .", "shortname": "styxtorrent", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "abandoned", "summary": "A BitTorrent Client", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1107931}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/styxtorrent/", "video_url": ""}
