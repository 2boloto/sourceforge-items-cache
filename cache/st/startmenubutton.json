One of the main things everybody noticed, and some didn't like, was that the Start Button was removed. Well, here is a small program to bring that back! It is open-source, which means the code is included for you to look at!\r\n\r\nNote: This program doesn't bring the old, classic Start Menu back! It just puts a Start Menu button, which when pressed, opens the Metro (Windows 8) Start Menu. This program is to give a small part of the old feel back.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Start Menu Button that opens the Windows 8 Start Menu\r\n- Start Menu Button is the new Windows logo\r\n- Exactly like the Start Menu Button which is being brought back in Windows 8.1\r\n- Source code included\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n- Unzip \"WindowsButton.zip\"\r\n- Right-click on \"WindowsButton.exe\"\r\n- Choose \"Pin to Taskbar\"\r\n- On the taskbar, slide it to the very left", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "startmenubutton", "_id": "5220757f90954756e22e673a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1942655, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}], "summary": "A start menu button for Windows 8 that launches the Metro Start Menu", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
