AEBL is a media player and a digital media platform in use in the IHDN XPO network media system ( http://www.ihdn.ca/Xpo_VI.html ).\r\n\r\nAEBL is foremost a mobile media distribution and playback framework.  It was created to be the core technology that is used in a television ad insertion and digital sign, and further development has opened up many more applications.  It currently is designed to run on a raspberry Pi, although it is being ported to other systems.\r\n\r\nThe AEBL blog is located here:\r\nhttp://aeblm2.blogspot.ca/\r\n\r\nFor those interested in trying it out, you will need a Raspberry Pi (should be the B series with 512MB) and a SD card (4GB or higher, recommend base 8GB but the larger, the better, for content storage).\r\n\r\nThe current image is a ~680MB 7zip compressed file of it's original 2.7GB size, located on dropbox, here:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lj0r6yia4tsnz8w/140815-aeblpi.img.7z?dl=0", "summary": "AEBL is a mobile media distribution system", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2309669, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/_NEA02NtI4E?rel=0", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@aeblm2", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aebl", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/krattai/", "username": "krattai", "name": "Kevin Rattai"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aebl/screenshot/AEBL_00.png", "caption": "AEBL boot splash", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aebl/screenshot/AEBL_00.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://aebl.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "id": 238}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Other toolkit", "fullname": "Other toolkit", "shortname": "ui_othertoolkit", "id": 495}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Email-based interface", "fullname": "Email-based interface", "shortname": "emailinterface", "id": 829}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Unix Shell", "fullname": "Unix Shell", "shortname": "shell", "id": 185}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Go", "fullname": "Go", "shortname": "go", "id": 908}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "fullname": "Other License", "shortname": "other", "id": 196}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "fullname": "Communications", "shortname": "communications", "id": 20}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Video", "fullname": "Video", "shortname": "video", "id": 125}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio", "fullname": "Sound/Audio", "shortname": "sound", "id": 113}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "fullname": "Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "id": 5}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}]}}
