AEBL is a media player and a digital media platform in use in the IHDN XPO network media system ( http://www.ihdn.ca/Xpo_VI.html ).\r\n\r\nAEBL is foremost a mobile media distribution and playback framework.  It was created to be the core technology that is used in a television ad insertion and digital sign, and further development has opened up many more applications.  It currently is designed to run on a raspberry Pi, although it is being ported to other systems.\r\n\r\nThe AEBL blog is located here:\r\nhttp://aeblm2.blogspot.ca/\r\n\r\nFor those interested in trying it out, you will need a Raspberry Pi (should be the B series with 512MB) and a SD card (4GB or higher, recommend base 8GB but the larger, the better, for content storage).\r\n\r\nThe current image is a ~680MB 7zip compressed file of it's original 2.7GB size, located on dropbox, here:\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lj0r6yia4tsnz8w/140815-aeblpi.img.7z?dl=0", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aebl", "_id": "53f66aa4c4314303aa3bc7fd", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2309669, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "AEBL is a mobile media distribution system", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "shortname": "communications", "fullname": "Communications", "id": 20}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Video", "shortname": "video", "fullname": "Video", "id": 125}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio", "shortname": "sound", "fullname": "Sound/Audio", "id": 113}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Unix Shell", "shortname": "shell", "fullname": "Unix Shell", "id": 185}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Go", "shortname": "go", "fullname": "Go", "id": 908}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other License", "id": 196}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "id": 238}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Other toolkit", "shortname": "ui_othertoolkit", "fullname": "Other toolkit", "id": 495}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Email-based interface", "shortname": "emailinterface", "fullname": "Email-based interface", "id": 829}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other Audience", "id": 5}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
