Open XDMoD has been created to be functional in any HPC environment and provides a wide range of metrics on HPC resources, including resource utilization, resource performance, and impact on scholarship and research. The Open XDMoD framework is designed to meet the following objectives: (1) provide the user community with a tool to manage their allocations and optimize their resource utilization, (2) provide operational staff with the ability to monitor and tune resource performance, (3) provide management with a tool to monitor utilization, user base, and performance of resources, and (4) provide metrics to help measure scientific impact.\r\n\r\nWant to be notified about Open XDMoD releases and news?
