The burden of assembling the displayed web page is shifted from the server to the client. \r\n\r\nThe main advantage to the document structure, i.e. how the data is laid out on the screen, being separated from the data, is that it can be changed without affecting the data, or the business logic. And the same data can have different templates that are customised to the user.\r\n\r\nAs document structure can be cached by the client, it means that on repeat visits, the server doesnt need to send it every time. This reduces the amount of data the server needs to send and brings incremental benefits to busy sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "fabiola", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 161228}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fabiola/", "video_url": ""}
