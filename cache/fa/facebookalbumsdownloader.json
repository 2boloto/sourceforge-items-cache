And some of them post amazing  photographs of their journey to some exotic location or of their most memorable moments which you were part of.\r\n\r\n We all love viewing such photographs again and again and we do download some of them. But the problem arises when we want the complete bank! Unfortunately, Facebook doesn't provide us with an option of downloading an entire album and that's where Facebook Album Downloader will be a handy desktop application.\r\n\r\n The best part of this desktop application is that we don't have to worry about the albums being stored on third-party servers from where you would eventually download the entire zip file. It's a bit lengthy and time consuming task. This application brings all those photos right to your computer. It's easy and very simple to use.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "facebookalbumsdownloader", "_id": "5349277a0594ca74f4d3e495", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2191410, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "master", "name": "git", "label": "fad"}], "summary": "A simple and easy to use application for downloading albums on FB", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Plugins :: Eclipse", "shortname": "eclipse_plugins", "fullname": "Eclipse", "id": 583}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Win2K", "shortname": "mswin_2000", "fullname": "Win2K", "id": 420}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "id": 906}]}}
