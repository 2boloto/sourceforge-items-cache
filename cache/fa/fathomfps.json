Use beacons to call down structures from the sea surface and layout your base of operations to begin your campaign. Construct units and command your fleet into the heart of your enemy's base! Set up blockades of deployable turrets and mines to defend strategic locations from your enemies. Call to the planet surface for depth charge bombardments or bring huge capital ships to bear in an all-out epic war beneath the waves! \r\n", "shortname": "fathomfps", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An FPS/RTS strategic action game set deep within planetary depths.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1956698}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fathomfps/", "video_url": null}
