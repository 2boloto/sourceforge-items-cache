Although many technologies have been developed to control access to files or resources, to enforce security policies, and to audit network usages, there does not exist a technology that can verify that the user who is using the system is the same person who logged in.\r\n\r\nFaceAccess provides a prototype implementation as a \"login module\" of an information system. The goal is to enhance the level of system security by periodically checking the user\u2019s identity without disrupting the user\u2019s activities.\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions can be found in the package. If you need anymore guidance, please use the Wiki to post any kind of inquiry.\r\n\r\nNB: Please use the \"External Link\" menus above to support this project in one way or another. PM me for other means. Any kind of support will be very much appreciated.
