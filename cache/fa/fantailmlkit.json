The algorithms can be called from your own Java code. It is also well-suited for developing new algorithms. Fantail is a multi-target learning extension to WEKA, and is at the early development stage. New algorithms and tools will be added to the library gradually, please send me an Email if you would like to join the team :-) \r\n\r\nA key difference between Fantail and another popular preference learning package WEKA-LR is: Fantail uses the rank vector format (similar to the multi-target regression setting) rather than the order/explicit preference vector format. So in Fantail, label ranking is treated as a special case of the multi-target regression problem. The advantage of the Fantail approach is that both multi-target and label ranking algorithms can be used and tested under a unified framework.
