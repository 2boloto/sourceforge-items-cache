In family-based sequencing studies, information from all family members should be utilized to more accurately identify new germline mutations. FamSeq serves this purpose by providing the probability of an individual carrying a variant given his/her entire family\u2019s raw measurements. FamSeq accommodates de novo mutations and can perform variant calling at chromosome X.\r\nTo accommodate variations in data complexity, FamSeq consists of three distinct implementations of the Mendelian genetic model: the Bayesian network algorithm, Elston-Stewart algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. To make the software efficient and applicable to large families, we parallelized the Bayesian network algorithm that copes with pedigrees with inbreeding loops without losing calculation precision on an NVIDIA\u00ae graphics processing unit.
