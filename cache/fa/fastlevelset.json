This is a novel (2005) and fast algorithm without the need of solving partial differential equations (PDE) while preserving the advantages of level set methods, such as the automatic handling of topological changes. Considerable speedups (\u00d7100) have been demonstrated as compared to PDE-based narrow band level-set implementations.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fastlevelset", "_id": "5529a877c4d1041941b9b30d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2443893, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
