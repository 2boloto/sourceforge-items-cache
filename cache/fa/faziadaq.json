The aim of the project is to build a 4Pi array for charged particles, with high granularity and good energy resolution, with A and Z identification capability over the widest possible range. It will use the up-to-date techniques concerning detection, signal processing and data flow, with full digital electronics. Neutron detection is also foreseen via the collaboration with the NEUTROMANIA group.\r\n\r\nFAZIA is designed to operate at stable and radioactive beams facilities like LNL-Legnaro, LNS-Catania in Italy, GANIL-SPIRAL and SPIRAL2 in France, GSI-FAIR in Germany in the horizon 2010-2015. The availability of the european radioactive beam facility EURISOL expected in the period 2015-2020 will also be a major opportunity for the FAZIA community.", "shortname": "faziadaq", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "The aim of FAZIA project is to build a 4Pi array for charged particles", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "link", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 779720}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/faziadaq/", "video_url": ""}
