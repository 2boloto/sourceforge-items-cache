And to make it a more ''fair'' game between players of different playing ability, I devised a handicap system which will make playing more fun for both sides, especially the weaker. It will result in longer games, more practice in middle game and endgames, and will be a better training method. It might revolutionize the chess world; see the readme.txt\r\nAlso,  the 'old' -default- version of chess (board setup) can be easily added to the game as option. To test the game  i made a prototype with the zillions-of-games method; see the screenshots. If two players (playing online possibly via server) have equal chess ability (which will be reflected in their 'status' e.g. pawn, knight, and so on) then the White player will have one pawn less in the initial setup (to compensate for the usual White default advantage).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fairchess", "_id": "53ea9d4790954704ac839687", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2304073, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "A new little  chess game , *Fair-Chess* with handicaps", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Board Games", "shortname": "boardgames", "fullname": "Board Games", "id": 287}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
