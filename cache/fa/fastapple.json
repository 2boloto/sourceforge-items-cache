A basic and straightforward GUI makes choosing files a cinch.\r\n\r\nCurrently three utilities are included:\r\n\r\nFASTA Concatenater combines multiple FASTA files  into a single FASTA file.\r\n\r\nFASTA Gene Concatenater strings the DNA sequences of each taxon in a set of pre-aligned FASTA files with identical taxa. Specifically designed to prepare RAxML analyses, it conveniently creates a partition file in addition to the concatenated file.\r\n\r\nGenBank Renamer automatically renames the taxa in a FASTA file downloaded from GenBank in the format Genus_species_accession", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fastapple", "_id": "4ffbb9ba0594ca369f0000b6", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 816729, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "AppleScript Utilities for Working Quickly with the FASTA File", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: AppleScript", "shortname": "applescript", "fullname": "AppleScript", "id": 547}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Cocoa (MacOS X)", "shortname": "cocoa", "fullname": "Cocoa (MacOS X)", "id": 310}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}]}}
