Specifically designed to prepare RAxML analyses, it conveniently creates a partition file in addition to the concatenated file.\r\n\r\nGenBank Renamer automatically renames the taxa in a FASTA file downloaded from GenBank in the format Genus_species_accession", "shortname": "fastapple", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "AppleScript Utilities for Working Quickly with the FASTA File", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 816729}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fastapple/", "video_url": ""}
