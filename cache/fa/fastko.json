The rapid accumulation of genomic and proteomic data from large scale disease studies, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provides an unprecedented opportunity for personalized metabolic modeling of large number of patient samples. The currently available metabolic modeling software, such as COBRA 2.0, requires substantial computing time conducting a knockout analysis, which limits its applications in large scale genome-wide analysis.\r\n\r\nHere, we developed a C/C++ package, termed FastKO, to effectively conduct knockout analysis of constraint-based metabolic models. FastKO is 60~260 times faster than COBRA 2.0 and returns consistent results, serving as a valuable tool for personalized genome-scale metabolic analysis.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fastko", "_id": "5448141f1be1ce40a8571f1d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2349489, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "FastKO for personalized genome-scale knockout analysis", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
