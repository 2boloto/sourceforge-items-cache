To create training or testing datasets, FASTQSim has the ability to convert target sequences into in silico reads with matching\r\nerror profiles.\r\n\r\nFASTQsim allows the user to simulate individual read datasets that can be used as standardized test scenarios for planning sequencing projects or for benchmarking metagenomic software. In this regard, in silico datasets generated with the FASTQsim tool hold several advantages over natural datasets: they are sequencing platform independent, extremely well characterized, and less expensive to generate.
