Although the CPU engine is a pure interpreter it is still capable of reasonably fast execution. On modern systems, it can reach rates of 35 to 50 million emulated instructions/sec and beyond.\r\n\r\nFake86 began in 2010 as just a project that I intended to use to familiarize myself with x86 assembly, it's binary instruction encoding format, as well learn the low-level details of the support chipset in an XT-style computer. A main goal is keeping the source as simple as reasonably possible to understand and modify. Soon the project began to expand beyond the basics to include extras like audio hardware emulation, ethernet emulation, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Windows build also has a simple drop-down menu interface to change out virtual disk images, change window resolution, etc.\r\n\r\nThe entire project's code base currently weighs in at comfortably under 7,200 lines of code.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fake86", "_id": "5054dee91be1ce47f25d8a4a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 918567, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A portable, open-source (GPLv2) 8086 PC emulator.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Emulators", "shortname": "emulators", "fullname": "Emulators", "id": 74}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
