It was a browser that was automatically directed to the pop-out chat URL.  That's all it was, nothing more.  While it was working, it received nearly 5,000 downloads.\r\n\r\nI posted it and forgot about it, to be honest.  It was such a simple project that I had no intention of maintaining it.  It's fantastic to see how popular it was - especially because I am really not a programmer.  I was messing around and stumbled on something useful.\r\n\r\nTo everyone who enjoyed it while it was working:  Thanks for your downloads and the feedback you left over the years - which I am only now catching up on.  I'm sorry, but as of now it is permanently discontinued, and there are far better options available.\r\n\r\n-Nick Highland", "shortname": "facebookchatapp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 306031}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/facebookchatapp/", "video_url": ""}
