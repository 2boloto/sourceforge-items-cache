It was a browser that was automatically directed to the pop-out chat URL.  That's all it was, nothing more.  While it was working, it received nearly 5,000 downloads.\r\n\r\nI posted it and forgot about it, to be honest.  It was such a simple project that I had no intention of maintaining it.  It's fantastic to see how popular it was - especially because I am really not a programmer.  I was messing around and stumbled on something useful.\r\n\r\nTo everyone who enjoyed it while it was working:  Thanks for your downloads and the feedback you left over the years - which I am only now catching up on.  I'm sorry, but as of now it is permanently discontinued, and there are far better options available.\r\n\r\n-Nick Highland", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "facebookchatapp", "_id": "516d8206e88f3d360a5c00e5", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 306031, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
