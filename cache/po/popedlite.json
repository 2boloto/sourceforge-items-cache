PopED lite can help you improve your experimental design by algorithmically searching through possible experimental designs and suggesting the optimal experimental design.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is based on mathematically sound optimal design theory; however, PopED lite is made for users without any background in optimal design or mathematics. Many of the most common models used for preclinical PKPD experiments are precoded and all you need to do is to choose the model and give some specification of the experiment you are running.\r\n\r\nThis optimal design software is optimised for the preclinical experimental workflow in the pharmaceutical industry. By following five simple steps clearly outlined in the graphical user interface, you can create a report of the optimised experiment specification in a matter of ten minutes", "shortname": "popedlite", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple, Fast, Intuitive optimal design software for preclin PKPD study", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2464334}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/popedlite/", "video_url": null}
