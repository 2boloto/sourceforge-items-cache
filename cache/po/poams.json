For smaller groups there is an embedded SQLite database that comes with the program. However, the program can be easily modified to work with MySQL or Oracle 11g. Please feel free to request these SQL scripts as they have been created and tested.  The front end will be a basic java desktop application which can be easily distribute from the network.
