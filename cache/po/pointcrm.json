It is more clean with simpliest structure and much lighter then vtiger (package 11 MB instead of 30 MB). It has been adapted to Polish companies (built-in default package Polish language, addresses and specific numbers identifying them such as NIP (VAT Identyfication Number), REGON, KRS). The system includes only modules associated closely with the sales CRM (Customers, Contacts, Leads, Potential Sales), marketing (Marketing Campaigns) and analytical (Reports, Dashboard). In addition, there is a module for integration with Internet Fax (email2fax, api2fax) and PBX (Asterisk). PointCRM is modular and you can also create your own extensions. It has the ability to extend validations of custom fields and create custom field types. Built-in field type to store geographic location (longitude / latitude) based on the google maps API.", "shortname": "pointcrm", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "CRM system based on vtiger, adapted to Polish companies.", "tools": [{"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 647265}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pointcrm/", "video_url": ""}
