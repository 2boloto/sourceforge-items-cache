Much like soccer or ice hockey. Each player of a team is called a pod, hence the name of the project. The pods and ball are circular objects that can move in any direction on the plane but are subject to inertia and friction.\r\n\r\nBut what is more important than the game itself is the way the teams are controlled: Teams are controlled by program modules that are up to you to conceive and develop! That is the programming contest part of Podball.\r\n\r\nPodball specifies a simple interface to which client code can connect to control the behavior of a team of pods on the field.\r\n", "shortname": "podball", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A futuristic ball game simulation and programming contest", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2232210}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/podball/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/PhRPpSl3Z8s?rel=0"}
