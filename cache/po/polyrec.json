The recognizer uses a nearest neighbor approach, and requires a small number of samples for each class. \r\n\r\nThe similarity between two gestures is calculated through a three steps procedure: \r\n-firstly, each gesture is approximated to a polyline, in order to extract its main movements; \r\n- then, the two polylines are aligned to obtain an equal number of segments from both of them; \r\n- lastly, the distance is found by summing the contribution of each pair of segments.\r\n\r\nThis implementation is a prototype developed for scientific purposes.
