With loads of features and the unique bonus of an added Forum, PowerPanel will serve your DJing needs suitably. You can tell PowerPanel is primarily for Habbo Fansites as it has the added feature of a Habbo Spotlight. This is where a User enters their name and their Habbo Player pops up somewhere on your site.\r\n\r\nPowerPanel has 4 Usergroups; Trialist DJ, Regular DJ, Senior DJ and Administrator.\r\n\r\nP.S.
