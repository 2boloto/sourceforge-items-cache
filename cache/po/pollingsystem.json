The script is not very stable and the code is still rough.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\ni. Download the script and unzip it to your localhost or web server. Works best with Wamp server.\r\nii. Import polling3.sql from the dbBackups folder in the admin folder. Use phpMyAdmin in this case or together with cPanel for online server.\r\niii. Add login.html into the Apache configuration file to enable direct redirection to the system. If you don't know the config file, Google for more info about this!!!\r\nv. You're done! Hooray!!! Now you can test drive the system. Username: admin, Password: admin, URL: http://localhost/yoursite/admin; For the admin section. The rest is in the database tables.\r\n\r\nNB: Please use the \"External Link\" menus above to support this project in one way or another. PM me for other means.
