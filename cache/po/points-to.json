KDD disambiguates the pointer-based relations including generic pointers - to infer their candidate types/values - by performing static points-to analysis on the kernel\u2019s source code. KDD takes the source code of an OS kernel as input and outputs an accurate directed type-graph that represents the kernel data definition. KDD is able to scale to the enormous size of kernel code, unlike many other points-to analysis tools.", "shortname": "points-to", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "KDD: Kernel Data Disambiguation Tool", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 764810}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/points-to/", "video_url": ""}
