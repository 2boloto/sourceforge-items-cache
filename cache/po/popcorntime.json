The program is intended as a free alternative to subscription-based video streaming services such as Netflix. At first glance the program seems to stream unauthorized copies of films using Bittorrent links provided by the website YTS, (yts.re, formerly YIFY). Other torrent trackers can be used if added manually. However, the Bittorrent protocol does not allow streaming either in a technical or legal sense; Instead a feature that is called sequential downloading is used. Likewise, uploading of the typically copyrighted content is happening in the same way as it is with all other Bittorrent clients. Popcorn Time quickly received unexpectedly positive media attention, with some comparing it to Netflix due to its ease of use. The program was abruptly taken down by its original developers on March 14, 2014, but was subsequently forked and taken over by other developers.", "shortname": "popcorntime", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Watch torrent movies instantly", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2332551}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/popcorntime/", "video_url": null}
