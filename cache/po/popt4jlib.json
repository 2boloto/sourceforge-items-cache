Implements a number of meta-heuristic algorithms for Non-Linear Programming, including Genetic Algorithms, Differential Evolution, Evolutionary Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Particle Swarm Optimization, Firefly Algorithm, Monte-Carlo Search, Local Search algorithms, Gradient-Descent-based algorithms, as well as some well-known network flow and other graph algorithms. A fast parallel implementation of the network simplex method, and some full-fledged parallel/distributed MIP solvers will be added in the next version. In general, emphasis is given in improving the efficiency of the algorithms in shared-memory models via java threads, since multi-core machines are so wide-spread today.", "shortname": "popt4jlib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Parallel Optimization Library for Java", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2308155}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/popt4jlib/", "video_url": null}
