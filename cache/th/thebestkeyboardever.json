While everything in your OS can be customized, from placement to color, from function to layout, the on screen keyboards can't be customized.\r\n\r\nThe best keyboard ever (BeKE, pronounced as bee-key) is a welcome change. It allows the user to:\r\n- Have an exact same layout of the on-screen keyboard as your physical keyboard\r\n- Allows the use of Ctrl, Function, Windows and other keys\r\n- Create custom shortcuts and store then as keys\r\n- Create new key layouts\r\n- Use swipe functionality\r\n- Use custom dictionaries\r\n\r\nBest of all its FREE and Open Source.
