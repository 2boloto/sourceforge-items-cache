The port will use the same files as the PC version so you must own the game to use this port.\r\n** Edit:**\r\nSorry to everyone wanting this port... in another project i have hit a few hickups that until further notice come has killed this project. they are as follows;\r\n1: due to the fact that the original game was written in assembly, it was running as fast as it could... i cant get code that optimized so it would be slower\r\nand\r\n2: due to the psps having no memory management that makes things really tough for coders because you have to structure everything, that and with the way how things would have to work on the psp the 20mb of ram (for everything including the gpu)is really limiting. \r\nSo until i figure out work arounds.... the project is Dead. sorry again. happy gaming!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "themeparktyc", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/tdtpd/", "username": "tdtpd", "name": "Barnstormer"}], "external_homepage": "http://themeparktyc.sourceforge.net"}
