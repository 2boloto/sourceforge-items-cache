The interpreter is not chiefly designed for speed, but for comfortable development.\r\n\r\nThe editor and command screen use a custom 8 x 8 font on a 64x16 character text display. There are currently three switchable screens: Game screen, Output/Command screen, and Editor screen.\r\n", "shortname": "theengine", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Game creation engine with built-in BASIC interpreter.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 889539}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/theengine/", "video_url": ""}
