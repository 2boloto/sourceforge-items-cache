This project aims to make it easier. We believe that enough free and open-source research exists in the public-domain such that - if properly assembled - it is possible to provide the community with free facial tracking and animation tools which are much more powerful than the existing expensive commercial alternatives. The aim is not to replace specialist teams, but to build a compelling alternative to commercial tools where users can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms in the field.\r\n\r\nThe computer vision and animation communities are encouraged to participate in the project.\r\n\r\nThe founders of this project are Dr. Gareth Edwards, Dr. Steve Caulkin and Dr. Steven Dorning of Cubic Motion and Vladimir Mastilovic of 3Lateral, specialists in computer vision and facial rigging and animation.\r\n\r\nWe intend the project to be licensed under the permissive Boost Software Licence.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "thefacialanimationtoolset", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/drgarethedwards/", "username": "drgarethedwards", "name": "Dr Gareth Edwards"}], "external_homepage": "http://thefacialanimationtoolset.sourceforge.net"}
