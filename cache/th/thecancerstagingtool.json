Rules are complex and complete staging is rarely achievable in limited resource settings.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR) developed a Microsoft Access-based staging tool. The tool calculates TNM and other site-specific cancer staging classifications from the basic data of the patientsâ€™ disease, entered by the registrar in a controlled fashion.\r\n\r\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is now collaborating with NICR to convert the tool into a web application. Authorised users will be able to access the tool from any Internet-enabled computer, by web browser via a dedicated interface. In agreement with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), this tool will be available freely for non-profit use in limited resource settings.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "thecancerstagingtool", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ervikm/", "username": "ervikm", "name": "Morten Ervik"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gnapolitano/", "username": "gnapolitano", "name": "Giulio Napolitano"}], "external_homepage": null}
