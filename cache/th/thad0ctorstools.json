In short it is the ultimate tool for those looking to make a wide variety of word lists for dictionary based and other brute force attacks.\r\n\r\nThe toolkit is designed with usability in mind for the Backtrack 5R2 linux distro but will also work on BT5 R1 and other Ubuntu based distros if configured properly.
