It offers new algorithm for concurrent peak deconvolution at different heating rates and provides full kinetic analysis of these data, including isoconversional methods for Ea, determination of reaction model and full kinetic triplet, Avrami coefficients, and dimensionality of crystal growth for reactions in the solid state.\r\n\r\nThe project is currently in alpha stage, where individual modules will be provided for data analysis. The modules for peak deconvolution, peak profile analysis and determination of Ea and lnA will be provided first. Full GUI will be provided in beta stage. Due to computational limitations, the code is partly programmed in Python and partly in R. Python code will eventually be fully integrated into GUI. R code might remain standalone, although it will be integrated to a highest possible degree.\r\n\r\nDistributed under GPL", "shortname": "thermv", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Comprehensive thermal analysis software package", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2321197}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/thermv/", "video_url": null}
