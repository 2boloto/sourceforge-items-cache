In the light of the latest Internet spying scandals, the goal of the project is to diminish the success of the automatic traffic analyzing engines of anyone who has the access to the chat servers. Those analyzing engines will notice just a cheap chat conversations, while the real encrypted information will be incorporated deeply in that cheap chat. The cheap chat is the cloak to the encrypted information communicated between two CryptoCloak clients. The first realization of the CryptoCloak uses the Skype API for Java programming language. The intermediate goals of the project are to produce wrappers for the most popular chat clients as well as clients for the most popular web browsers.", "shortname": "thecryptocloakproject", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The CryptoCloak project", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1997583}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/thecryptocloakproject/", "video_url": ""}
