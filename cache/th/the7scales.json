It is conceived as a kind of pool of active knowledge in the area of telecommunication processes that can be modeled by MAP, INAP and CAP. This Project supports two modes of operation \u2013 simulation mode to develop and tests scenarios, and network mode to execute scenarios against the network. Communication with the network use a light version of SCTP and M2PA.\r\nThe project is completed to the stage of recognising Application Contexts and Operations for MAPv1/2/3, CAP1/2/3/4 and Ericsson CS1+. Therefore, any scenario can be developed. ISUP is not developed although is it the easiest of all. See the roadmap to get informed about the status and plans.\r\nThe 7-Scales is written in C under Linux. It requires some C-development skills and considerable knowledge in the area of SS7 Application Parts, namelly MAP, INAP and CAP.", "shortname": "the7scales", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple development environment for SS7-MAP, INAP and CAP", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1132269}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/the7scales/", "video_url": ""}
