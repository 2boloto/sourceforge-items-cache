And so it seems clever to let PHP do this. Nevertheless there is one hitch: The thumbs are by far not high-quality. They almost always look better if you create them manually.\r\nAs you see, it is high time for this plugin! It automatically creates the tiny images and uses an unsharp mask to get the best quality possible. Of course the images are cached, because the unsharp mask needs more CPU-power than the conventional way.\" CE\r\n\r\nThis new improved thumb plugin gots some addons. For example a legend and supporting transparent GIFs. Additionally there is a wrapper available from the old plugin to this one, so that you needn't change your HTML / smarty code.\r\n\r\nThe original version of thumb comes from Christoph Cerdmann (CE). First public version of thumb_imp was 20071027.\r\n\r\nThis program uses PHP (5.x.y) as scripting language. This PHP program uses the 'Smarty' (2.6.x/3.1.x) template engine.\r\n\r\nFor the pa", "shortname": "thumb-imp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "thumb improved ( smarty image plugin )", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 205464}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Feature Requests", "mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/thumb-imp/", "video_url": ""}
