Thermostat do not use PID control but a simple on/off with hysteresis (like ordinary mechanical thermostat would - note that function in source that decides to turn heater on/off is called pid() but that's not how decision is made). Note that it's designed to measure 5 regions and control 5 groups of heaters but *all* of them are trying to reach *same* temperature. If a region goes too much off the set temperature alarm (+1 relay) will switch on. Firmware can be easily adapted to work as 5 thermometers (each region to have it's own temperature) but I did not find that useful.\r\n\r\nUses nokia 3310 lcd to display informations.\r\n\r\nSource is written in CSC PICC C compiler\r\n\r\nHex is in \"Software\" directory, note that HEX has commented lines at the end (;...), some programming applications do not know how to handle HEX with comment so just remove all lines starting with ; and it will program properly.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "thermo5", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bogdan-kecman/", "username": "bogdan-kecman", "name": "Bogdan Kecman"}], "external_homepage": "http://elco.crsndoo.com/wordpress/2010/07/termostat-sa-5-zona/"}
