It may be used as a pentesting laptop replacement, drop box, or drone.  Several addon modules are available that allow for coordinated attacks from up to a mile away using multiple devices connected via 802.15.4 networking (MeshDeck), forensic investigation of USB devices (4Deck), and airborne delivery of pentesting drones and/or aerial drone capabilities (AirDeck).\r\nThe Deck is based on Ubuntu and features hundreds of pentesting tools such as Metasploit and aircrack-ng that have been ported to this platform.  The low power consumption of the Beagles (approximately 1W) allows devices running The Deck to be battery powered.  Devices are easily planted due to their small size.\r\nThis project is fully described in Hacking and Penetration Testing with Low Power Devices by Philip Polstra http://bit.ly/1pyT6wd http://amzn.to/1t4nQuc", "shortname": "thedeck", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@ppolstra", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Penetration testing Linux distro for BeagleBoard/BeagleBone systems", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1935866}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/thedeck/", "video_url": null}
