It is easy. This Project is also an educational one.\r\n\r\nFor example: sloppy typing.\r\nJust think what this means: the user presses a Little bit to the left or right, which means: the Position and value pairs of \"en_hashes\" must be adjusted +- 1. Thats all.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for missing words: just Import another book (basically any ASCII file, or Import your mail conversations).\r\n\r\nOr let the database learn from user Inputs. Just update the \"en_context\" score after the user selects a word.\r\n\r\nThose examples Show you how easy it is :-)", "shortname": "theminimumkeybo", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Minimal keyboard suited for use in web-projects and mobile devices", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1427374}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/theminimumkeybo/", "video_url": ""}
