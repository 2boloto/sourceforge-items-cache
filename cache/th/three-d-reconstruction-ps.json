This rubric is very useful in many applications including robot navigation, terrain modeling, remote surgery, shape analysis, computer interaction, scientific visualization, movie making, and computer aided design. In this work, we studied photometric stereo approach as a single view 3D reconstruction technique, performed experimental validations on synthetic data. Matlab implementation is available.
