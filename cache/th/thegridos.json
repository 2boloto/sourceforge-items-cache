Anyone on the grid os should be able to have this handled for them automatically, instead of having to set up such a system.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to put this project in motion, join.", "shortname": "thegridos", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "learning from over 20 years of failures", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1027762}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/thegridos/", "video_url": ""}
