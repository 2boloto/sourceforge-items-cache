TMW uses 2D graphics and aims to create a large and diverse interactive world. It is licensed under the GPL, making sure this game can't ever run away from you.\r\n\r\nThe project includes the development of both a client and a server, as well as the development of an online world. At the moment we're making alpha releases of the client, while our server is in early development. The eAthena free software Ragnarok Online server is used until our own server has matured enough to replace it. Once ready, we'll be making releases of our server too so anybody will be free to set up their own server and start building their own online world.", "shortname": "themanaworldoriginalserver", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1900121}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/themanaworldoriginalserver/", "video_url": ""}
