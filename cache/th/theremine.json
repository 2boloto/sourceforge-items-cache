It was originally designed to work with an Open.Theremin.UNO shield (see http://www.gaudi.ch/OpenTheremin), although it should work with other Arduino devices as long as you provide an appropriate program.\r\n\r\nTh\u00e9r\u00e9mine can play a variety of different tones. It comes with another program, Loop bank manager, whose purpose is to extract stationnary, looping samples from recorded wave files. It allows importing new instrumental tones into Th\u00e9r\u00e9mine, as long as the source recording contains reasonable data. Two demo sample banks are provided with Th\u00e9r\u00e9mine featuring violin and voice tones. Both were made using Loop bank manager.", "shortname": "theremine", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Th\u00e9r\u00e9mine generates high quality audio from an USB Arduino Theremin", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2471995}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/theremine/", "video_url": null}
