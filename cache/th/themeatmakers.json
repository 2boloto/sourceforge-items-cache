A major role in what kind of food we eat foes to our parents as whatever eating habits we have they largely contribute to it. Whether it is we what fruits more, junk food, ready to eat or meat everything depends upon the kind of environment we are brought into and then when we move out a lot depends upon where we stay and our circle and the availability of variety of food in the area. With so much of modernisation these days one gets anything and everything everywhere and thus the best of the food is available everywhere round the corner. These days since we are more health conscious and everyone is concerned about living a healthy lifestyle we tend to chose and eat something which is healthy for body and mind.
