Large peaks in LCMS traces are not equal to major components but their ionizability. The effectiveness of a medicinal plant, poisons in a mushroom, resistance and susceptibility to pest and diseases are not necessarily because of the compounds that give large peaks. These traits are determined by the different levels of specific metabolites which may show up only as very small peaks.\r\nHow would it be possible to spot an important metabolite or two, from 1000\u2019s that occur in cells and tissues? If those truly relevant metabolites were missed during peak-picking then the following stats, however sophisticated they may be, would fail. And how many peaks are there in a single LCMS run? How can the important metabolites be represented in the top 100 or even 10000 peaks?
