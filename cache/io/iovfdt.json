Decision tree, which has a high degree of knowledge interpretation, has been favored in many real world applications. However noisy values commonly exist in high-speed data streams, e.g. real-time online data feeds that are prone to interference. When processing big data, it is hard to implement pre-processing and sampling in full batches. To solve this trade-off, we propose a new decision tree so called incrementally optimized very fast decision tree (iOVFDT).  Inheriting the use of Hoeffding bound in VFDT algorithm for node-splitting check, it contains four optional strategies of functional tree leaf, which improve the classifying accuracy. In addition, a multi-objective incremental optimization mechanism investigates a balance among accuracy, mode size and learning speed...", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "iovfdt", "_id": "510b2cd81be1ce26a6c8a2a4", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1265077, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "iOVFDT algorithm of incremental decision tree", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
