Decision tree, which has a high degree of knowledge interpretation, has been favored in many real world applications. However noisy values commonly exist in high-speed data streams, e.g. real-time online data feeds that are prone to interference. When processing big data, it is hard to implement pre-processing and sampling in full batches. To solve this trade-off, we propose a new decision tree so called incrementally optimized very fast decision tree (iOVFDT).  Inheriting the use of Hoeffding bound in VFDT algorithm for node-splitting check, it contains four optional strategies of functional tree leaf, which improve the classifying accuracy. In addition, a multi-objective incremental optimization mechanism investigates a balance among accuracy, mode size and learning speed...", "shortname": "iovfdt", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "iOVFDT algorithm of incremental decision tree", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1265077}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/iovfdt/", "video_url": ""}
