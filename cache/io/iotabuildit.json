We hope to see submissions of graphics, sprites, level designs, storylines, everything down to the fundamental mechanics of the game. And we hope that a rating system will help the best of the best evolve out of this project, generating an ever-growing and improving massive 2D game. The game runs in an HTML5-capable browser, so it's very easily accessible to a range of platforms. The \"iota\" in the title suggests that even small contributions from a large quantity of players can come together to make something great. Being an experimental project, it may take a while to find the path, but let's see what we can work out.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "iotabuildit", "_id": "4f7f7d090594ca63b8000e33", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 741314, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Experimental project in crowd-sourced scrolling game development.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "shortname": "sidescrolling", "fullname": "Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "id": 288}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: Social Networking", "shortname": "socialnetworking", "fullname": "Social Networking", "id": 663}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: .NET/Mono", "shortname": "ui_dotnet", "fullname": ".NET/Mono", "id": 469}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
