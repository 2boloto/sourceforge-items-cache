We hope to see submissions of graphics, sprites, level designs, storylines, everything down to the fundamental mechanics of the game. And we hope that a rating system will help the best of the best evolve out of this project, generating an ever-growing and improving massive 2D game. The game runs in an HTML5-capable browser, so it's very easily accessible to a range of platforms. The \"iota\" in the title suggests that even small contributions from a large quantity of players can come together to make something great. Being an experimental project, it may take a while to find the path, but let's see what we can work out.", "shortname": "iotabuildit", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Experimental project in crowd-sourced scrolling game development.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 741314}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/iotabuildit/", "video_url": ""}
