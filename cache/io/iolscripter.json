The *.iol file will be opened by the native application called IOL installer.\r\nBy registering himself the user can track the record of previous installations and this way he will not have to choose the packages again and can simply download the configuration file from installonlinux.org which will be opened by IOL installer. The users can select more than one packages or remove the selection using the cart. If the user is not registered then also he will get the configuration file but will not be able to track the previous configurations. \r\nOur web portal provides all the necessary software at one place that decreases the time of downloading the packages from different sites. The aim is to provide the software altogether and let install the selected software by just one click.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "iolscripter", "_id": "4f74c904b9363c492b000079", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 735258, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "InstallonLinux.org is a portal for installing the packages on Linux", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
