IOTL further ensures backward- and forward-compatibility with any version of your application. Those points are at the core of the library:\r\n- Any file written by IOTL on a certain device can be read on any other device, regardless of the compiler and the platform.\r\n- If your application gets an update and now read/write files in a new binary format (which should break backward compatibility with older versions of your application), IOTL will still manage to read older files, and the previous version of your application will still be able to read your new files.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "iotl", "_id": "544bb8fabcf63a6c8b7e221f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2351136, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": " IOTL enables to serialize data in a portable way.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Formats and Protocols :: Data Formats", "shortname": "data_formats", "fullname": "Data Formats", "id": 554}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
