This standards-based data plane abstraction, called OpenFlow?, provides a novel approach to dynamically provision the network fabric from a centralized softwarebased controller.\r\n\r\nAn open SDN platform with centralized software provisioning delivers dramatic improvements in your network agility via programmability and automation, while substantially reducing the cost of your network operations. And using an industry standard data plane abstraction protocol like OpenFlow?, you are now free to use any type and brand of data plane devices, since all the underlying network hardware is addressable through a common abstraction protocol.\r\n\r\nProblems of original vSw", "shortname": "sdn", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2339669}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sdn/", "video_url": null}
