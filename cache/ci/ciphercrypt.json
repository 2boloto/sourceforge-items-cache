The project uses basic block ciphers to scramble plain text fields. These block ciphers are by no means secure against attack, nor are they meant to be, CipherCrypt C++ is more about providing cipher functionality in a easy-to-use format for small scale projects.\r\n\r\nCipherCrypt C++ comes packaged with an SDL framework GUI which showcases the read/write and block cipher functionality in a context in which they can be used immediately. The program comes in Windows (Vs C++) and Linux (Eclipse) versions. The windows version comes with a re-distributable but the Linux version requires some set up.\r\n\r\nCipherCrypt C++'s core functionality can be isolated to two files: CipherCrypt.h and CipherCrypt.cpp. These files can be placed into any C++ project and have been designed to be easily usable.\r\n\r\nSee the readme in the project for more detailed information.", "summary": "A C++ program which packages Input/Output and block ciphers.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2437498, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/CipherCryptCPP?fref=ts", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ciphercrypt", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/x2kpb/", "username": "x2kpb", "name": "x2kpb"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ciphercrypt/screenshot/Untitled.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ciphercrypt/screenshot/Untitled.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://ciphercrypt.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
