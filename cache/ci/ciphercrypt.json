The project uses basic block ciphers to scramble plain text fields. These block ciphers are by no means secure against attack, nor are they meant to be, CipherCrypt C++ is more about providing cipher functionality in a easy-to-use format for small scale projects.\r\n\r\nCipherCrypt C++ comes packaged with an SDL framework GUI which showcases the read/write and block cipher functionality in a context in which they can be used immediately. The program comes in Windows (Vs C++) and Linux (Eclipse) versions. The windows version comes with a re-distributable but the Linux version requires some set up.\r\n\r\nCipherCrypt C++'s core functionality can be isolated to two files: CipherCrypt.h and CipherCrypt.cpp. These files can be placed into any C++ project and have been designed to be easily usable.\r\n\r\nSee the readme in the project for more detailed information.", "shortname": "ciphercrypt", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/CipherCryptCPP?fref=ts", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A C++ program which packages Input/Output and block ciphers.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2437498}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ciphercrypt/", "video_url": null}
