They are intended to be included with live admin and rescue distributions such as System Rescue CD and Finnix and can image Windows installs to both local and network storage with one short, simple command.\r\n\r\nim and cim are intentionally restricted to only being able to use the first partition on the first storage device for both its image source and destination, which was the default location for Windows until 7 introduced its hidden boot partition. Hence, if you wish to clone Windows 7 with cim you must have installed 7 into a single partition and you must also sysprep your install before imaging to avoid having to use the Windows 7 install DVD repair tool after to get it to boot.", "summary": "Fast and easy imaging of NTFS drives", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 645868, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cimimaging", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/danboid/", "username": "danboid", "name": "Daniel MacDonald"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Unix Shell", "fullname": "Unix Shell", "shortname": "shell", "id": 185}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}]}}
