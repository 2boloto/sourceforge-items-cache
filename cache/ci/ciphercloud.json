It can also compress the selected documents into an archive with a lock. This is best when used together with cloud storage tools like SkyDrive, DropBox or Google Drive.\r\n\r\nCipherbox has several advantages:\r\n1. It supports native document encryption algorithms, which means that you can open your documents everywhere.\r\n2. It implements all functions independently to MS Office or Adobe Acrobat. You don\u2019t need to buy software to use it.\r\n3. It supports fast lock/unlock operations on files in batch.\r\n4. It is a light-weighted and portable tool to protect your documents up in the cloud.\r\n\r\nCipherbox supports various file types:\r\n*  Microsoft Office 2007-2013 documents (*.docx, *.pptx, *.xlsx, *.xlsb)\r\n*  Microsoft Office 97-2003 documents (*.doc, *.ppt, *.xls. for verification only)\r\n*  All Adobe PDF versions (*.pdf)\r\n*  WinZip  (*.zip)", "shortname": "ciphercloud", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Protecting your documents everywhere", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1945583}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ciphercloud/", "video_url": ""}
