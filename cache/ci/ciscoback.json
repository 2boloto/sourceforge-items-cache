It will also allow comparision of configuration files backed up in different times. System will also make possible backup of network devices\u00b4s binary operating system file. \r\nProcess of backuping can be started automatically or manually. \r\nAll network devices\u00b4s parameters, ways of communication and directory paths are loaded from single configuration file.\r\n\r\nCiscoback is intended for Debian based GNU/Linux operating systems.\r\n", "shortname": "ciscoback", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "System for backup of network devices configuration.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2207046}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ciscoback/", "video_url": null}
