Everything needed will be collaboratively developed by the worldwide community and will be accessible to everyone via download of the design by itself or the more useful STL file which can be used to \"print\" the object out using 3D printers or can be produced in fully automated production plants. Our goal is to \"print out\" whole city systems including all their infrastructures while offering enough room for customization. Each city will be total selfsufficient by providing its own electricity, food, water and all the production activities of goods while interconnected with other cities via the information grid, the maglev transportation grid and the electricity grid. Electricity will be provided through the harvesting of all forms of solar energy and geothermal energy.Everyone has access to everything for free while contributing to the community", "shortname": "citydevelopment", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A community based approach to create a City Development Kit ", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 812713}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/citydevelopment/", "video_url": ""}
