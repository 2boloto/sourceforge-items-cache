First of all, there is not a common abstract nor concrete language to express combinatorial problems. Combinatorial testing generator tools are strongly decoupled making difficult their interoperability and the exchange of models and data. In this project, we propose an abstract and concrete specific language for combinatorial problems. It features and formally defines the concepts of parameters and types, constraints, seeds, and test goals. The language is defined by means of Xtext, a framework for the definition of domain-specific languages. Xtext is used to derive a powerful editor integrated with eclipse and with all the expected features of a modern editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO INSTALL CITLAB SEE THE DOWNLOAD IN WIKI SECTION <https://sourceforge.net/p/citlab/wiki/Download>", "summary": "Combinatorial Interaction Testing Laboratory", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2449694, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}], "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/UnIJHvlxzS0?rel=0", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "citlab", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/garganti/", "username": "garganti", "name": "Angelo Gargantini"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/vavas726/", "username": "vavas726", "name": "Paolo Vavassori"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/citlab/screenshot/screenshot.png", "caption": "ScreenShot", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/citlab/screenshot/screenshot.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/citlab/screenshot/screenshot1.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/citlab/screenshot/screenshot1.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://citlab.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "id": 12}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java SWT", "fullname": "Java SWT", "shortname": "ui_swt", "id": 472}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Modeling", "fullname": "Modeling", "shortname": "modeling", "id": 563}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing", "fullname": "Testing", "shortname": "testing", "id": 575}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
