Cijac allows configurations, updates, and changes to be made to a central server and then distributed over the network to all clients.\r\n\r\n*Update*\r\n\r\nThe Cijac program was started in an environment where multiple computers needed to mirror the same admin files, but the ability to push or pull updates was very manual. Since that time, I have moved on to other projects, and, as should be obvious, Cijac has been abandoned. If there is still a need, I am willing to put more time into this and get it to a working point. However, I no longer have an environment conducive to testing this, or the same necessity to help drive the development. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in seeing this program developed further, please let me know. Otherwise, I will pull it off of Sourceforge.
