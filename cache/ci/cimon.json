Android applications can use the CIMON API to easily register monitors, and the CIMON monitoring service will integrate each of these requests to meet their needs efficiently.  \r\n\r\nThere are a variety of metrics supported related to system status and activity, sensors, and user activity.  CIMON also supports registering of complex monitors which are represented by boolean expressions.  These monitors can notify applications when a particular event or condition has occurred.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the monitoring service, there is an administration app, shown in the screenshots, which allows you to easily add new monitors.\r\n\r\nFor more complete information, check out the project homepage.  The complete JavaDoc is available at the homepage.  The source code is freely available and can be extended to include additional metrics.", "summary": "A Configurable Integrated Monitoring (CIMON) system for Android", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1866985, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cimon", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ndroid/", "username": "ndroid", "name": "NDroid"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/cpu_util_mon1.png", "caption": "CPU utilization monitor active", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/cpu_util_mon1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/sensor_active_monitors2.png", "caption": "Viewing active sensor monitors", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/sensor_active_monitors2.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/notifications.png", "caption": "Generate monitoring reports and send to email", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/notifications.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/system_tab.png", "caption": "System metrics administration tab", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/system_tab.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/sensors_tab.png", "caption": "Sensor metrics administration tab", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cimon/screenshot/sensors_tab.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://m-lab.cse.nd.edu/?page_id=29", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools", "fullname": "Build Tools", "shortname": "build", "id": 46}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Logging", "fullname": "Logging", "shortname": "logging", "id": 148}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Mobile", "fullname": "Mobile", "shortname": "mobileapps", "id": 688}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Handheld/Embedded Operating Systems :: Android", "fullname": "Android", "shortname": "android", "id": 728}]}}
