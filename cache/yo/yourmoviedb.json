Well, now there’s a way! The name of the application is  \"My Movie Database\" and it is ambiguous to what the application is. It is also not affiliated to any other company. The application uses Netflix API and THEMovieDB API to help get the most information possible for your personally stored movie database. The application allows you to import all the movies you have watched from Netflix directly into your personal database. You can also manage your Netflix queued movies right in the application, allowing for adding, deleting, moving the location in your queue, and start “Instant Watching” movies when applicable. You can lookup all associated movies to an actor from another movie and add them to your screen with a click of a button.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "yourmoviedb", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/seanallen/", "username": "seanallen", "name": "Sean Allen"}], "external_homepage": "http://ctdomain.com/mymoviedb/"}
