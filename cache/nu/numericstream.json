That project is still under development but the software that broadcasts the data is 'finished' and should be useful for things other than weather stations. \r\nThis software is a set of tools to stream data directly from instrumentation via databases, to webpages. This starts with a driver, taking serial ascii data to an SQLite database. Subsequently client applications can take this data to display on webpages, export to text file, and almost anything else.\r\nThe driver has been written using the mingw port of the gcc compiler, currently the system runs on Windows XP, however the design is deliberately cross platform, and linux based serial port interfaces will be added.\r\nThe first client is written in php, and tested using the Apache web server. The client is currently a proof of concept, and needs some work!
