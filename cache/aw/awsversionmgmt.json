This tool aims to provide some help with that.\r\nHave a look at the usage page here: http://awsversionmgmt.sourceforge.net/usage.html for examples on how this tool can be used in scripts for cleanup purposes and others.\r\nProject is entirely Java based and makes usage of the Amazon's AWS SDK for Java. It is intended as a command-line tool (so it can be easily integrated in things like cron jobs etc) however there are plans to to implement a GUI interface too.\r\nThis project has been reviewed by SoftPedia as per: http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/aws-s3-version-mgmt.shtml", "summary": "Command line utility for versioning-enabled S3 buckets in AWS", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1323308, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "liviutudor", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "awsversionmgmt", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/liviutudor/", "username": "liviutudor", "name": "TheLiv"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/awsversionmgmt/screenshot/2013-03-01%2005.15.50%20pm.png", "caption": "Standard help screen", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/awsversionmgmt/screenshot/2013-03-01%2005.15.50%20pm.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://awsversionmgmt.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache Software License", "fullname": "Apache Software License", "shortname": "apache", "id": 296}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage", "fullname": "Storage", "shortname": "storage", "id": 638}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: File Management", "fullname": "File Management", "shortname": "file_management", "id": 601}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Filesystems", "fullname": "Filesystems", "shortname": "filesystems", "id": 142}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
