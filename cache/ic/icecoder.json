By allowing you to code directly within the web browser, online or offline, it means you only need one program (your browser) to develop sites, plus can test on actual web servers. After development, you can also maintain the website easily, all of which make for speedy and smart development.\r\n\r\nBecause it can be web based you can use it from any internet enabled computer with a modern browser and because it's built with commom web languages, you can customise it to your liking, integrating with online services. If you'd like to use it as a desktop code editor, no problems, you only need PHP 5.0+ (though 5.3+ is recommeded), so you can use on Linux and on PC via WAMP or XAMPP and Mac via MAMP (or another PHP installation).\r\n\r\nICEcoder is provided under a free 14 day trial and $5 to continue using after the trial has ended.\r\n\r\nSee more details, features and much more at https://icecoder.net", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "icecoder", "_id": "5476f1e3ea406b77897b04c0", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2370029, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Browser based code editor, allowing you to code from anywhere", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Text Editors", "shortname": "editors", "fullname": "Text Editors", "id": 63}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Text Editors :: Integrated Development Environments (IDE)", "shortname": "ide", "fullname": "Integrated Development Environments (IDE)", "id": 65}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools", "shortname": "build", "fullname": "Build Tools", "id": 46}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
