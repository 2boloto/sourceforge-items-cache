The calculations of the interference profile are performed taking into account the experimental conditions: excitation light incidence angle, wavelength range, luminescent centers distribution. \r\nAn excitation field depth distribution map (*.bmp), normally calculated by the IMD software (D.L. Windt) is required for the calculations.\r\nThe module is presented both as LabVIEW virtual instrument and executable requiring LabVIEW runtime (http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/2534/lang/en).
