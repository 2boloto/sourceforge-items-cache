It is able to simulate grid-connected or standalone microgrids with solar, wind or other renewable energy sources. The proposed software calculates the power generated by each source in the microgrid and then it conducts a power flow analysis. This software is helpful for optimal placement of distributed generation units in a micro grid.\r\nRAPSim is designed for use in science and classroom with a simple to use graphical interface. It is an easily extendable framework that supports users in implementation of their own models, for grid objects, and algorithms for grid control.", "shortname": "rapsim", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An easy to use GUI enables electric source and grid simulation.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2125112}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rapsim/", "video_url": null}
