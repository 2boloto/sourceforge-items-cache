It is able to simulate grid-connected or standalone microgrids with solar, wind or other renewable energy sources. The proposed software calculates the power generated by each source in the microgrid and then it conducts a power flow analysis. This software is helpful for optimal placement of distributed generation units in a micro grid.\r\nRAPSim is designed for use in science and classroom with a simple to use graphical interface. It is an easily extendable framework that supports users in implementation of their own models, for grid objects, and algorithms for grid control.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rapsim", "_id": "531735c524b0d9704c73b895", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2125112, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "An easy to use GUI enables electric source and grid simulation.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Simulations", "shortname": "simulations", "fullname": "Simulations", "id": 600}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: ADO.NET", "shortname": "adonet", "fullname": "ADO.NET", "id": 835}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
