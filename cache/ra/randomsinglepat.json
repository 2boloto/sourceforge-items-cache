It does it by dividing the area into horizontal lines. In this case it divides it into 4 horizontal lines on which it marks 5 point on each horizontal line. Then it marks point #1 in the first line as the farthest top left point. Then it chooses a different or the same point from the same horizontal line randomly. Then it chooses another random point for horizontal line #2 and #3 in this case and after that it chooses the last point at the bottom right corner and randomly a point from the #4 horizontal line. After that it connects all these points and a random path is generated. This algorithm can be improved by instead of choosing points on the horizontal lines, it would choose points randomly on a bigger area from top to bottom. Then it would connect these points from top to bottom. It also can be improved by not only connecting the points from top to bottom, but once from top the once from bottom, back and forth.
