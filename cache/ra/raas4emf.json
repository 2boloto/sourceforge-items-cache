A code generator that takes an annotated EMF Ecore metamodel and generates a CDO-based object repository, which exposes Web services interfaces that transfer medium-grained object sub-graphs to and from the repository to a remote client.\r\n\r\n2. A basic RAP-based HTML5 user interface to a model repository of a simple file/directory structure - called RaaSCMS - to allow uploads of repository contents via files that can be parsed into EMF models. The RaaSCMS UI allows for the stored models to be browsed at the high level by the CMS tree, and for each model uploaded to be browsed using the standard EMF tree viewer. \r\n\r\n3. jQVT - a Java code generator which uses the structure of the MOF QVT specification to specify relations between Java and EMF object types, and create output instances from a set of input instances by matching Java expressions used as predicates.
