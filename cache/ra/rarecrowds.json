We have integrated with AppNexus, and any existing AppNexus account holder can install and use the Rare Crowds App from their App Marketplace. We are in process of integrating with other DSPs.\r\n\r\nMedia Buyers can fully execute their buys for both standard inventory and \"rare\" inventory in a fully automated way. Our technology will ensure that the entire budget is spent against the optimal set of inventory, across any inventory source. \r\n\u200b\r\nOur second product is in Beta, and ready for use by Publishers. We are currently integrated with DoubleClick for Publishers, but we will add other ad servers as well.\r\n\ufeff\r\nPublisher's ad operations teams can respond to RFPs with \"rare\" inventory that is highly targeted.
