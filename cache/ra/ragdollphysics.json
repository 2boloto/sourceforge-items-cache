I chosed to simulate ragdoll physics in 2D. There is mainly two path you could go when to simulate a physical ragdoll. Either you could chose to implement a fully physical rigid bodies, or you could mimic these rigid bodies with particle systems and constraints. This program uses verlet integration and constraints.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ragdollphysics", "_id": "52c45011f1fd8d077d6586e2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2062747, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Fun ragdoll physics simulator, built on particles and verlet", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
