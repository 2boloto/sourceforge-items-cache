Specifically, it caters to Fordham University students. \r\n\r\nIt is written entirely in Perl, and does not require a database to use. It is not a project for a computer science class; it is a passion project because I've found so few solutions for effective student planners online (also, I'm not a computer science student, so there's that).\r\n\r\nI wish to do everything for Fordham students that Fordham IT has either failed to do, or actively chosen not to do. In this sense, Ramel is not overly ambitious, given this low standard.", "shortname": "ramel", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A planner made for Fordham University students", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1010930}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ramel/", "video_url": ""}
