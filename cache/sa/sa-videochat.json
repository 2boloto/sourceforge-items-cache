The main idea is to make it easy for students to set up a session without the intervention of the teacher and to record and archive the recording without the need of installing additional software. There are two interfaces: the recorder and the player. The recorder should distinguish itself from already existent videoconferencing systems by its ease of use, recording and archiving which should be its main features. The player's most distinctive functionality is the solo/mute buttons which allow teachers to listen to the group or to a specific learner in isolation. There will be no moderator or administrator roles, all participants will have the same profile and it will be designed specifically for language students carrying out synchronous tasks.", "shortname": "sa-videochat", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "moved", "summary": "Announcement:This project is moved to https://github.com/UOC/Videochat", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1144468}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sa-videochat/", "video_url": null}
