SeART addresses the problem of selecting, depending on the current context, a subset of tasks to be scheduled by the operating system in order to achieve the user\u2019s objective, by meeting real-time and additional constraints. Thus SeART schedule tasks not only on the basis of their timing constraints, but also to choose between available tasks depending on the current context, user constraints and the \u201csemantic content of tasks\u201d.Towards this end, it can be easily interfaced with existing middleware for robotics to provide them with extended functionality.
