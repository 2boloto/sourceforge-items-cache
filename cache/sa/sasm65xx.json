It is an experiment to become more familiar with how CPUs and computers work.   I selected the 6502 for its popularity, and theoretically well documented architecture.   To that end it was created in managed code using C# and less attention was paid to optimization, instead it represents something closer the the actual state machines present in a CPU.\r\n\r\nMy primary goals for this project have been completed.   Write a 6502 CPU from scratch capable of ruining an existing Basic interpreter.  Second emulate enough hardware to interact with the CPU.", "shortname": "sasm65xx", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "MOS 6502 Emulator", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1247207}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sasm65xx/", "video_url": ""}
