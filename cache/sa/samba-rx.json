The fixes contained in this package can remedy the problems at runtime without modifying the original Samba programs. These issues will probably never be addressed in original Samba. So, samba-rx can help you, if you experience one of the following problems:\r\n\r\n* microsoft office applications state, that they cannot open document files on Samba shares, though it should be allowed by group or world read permission (but the file is not owned by you)\r\n\r\n* a microsoft office application is opening a document file for writing and this takes over a minute without any obvious reason\r\n\r\n* You see errors in the Samba log like this one: matchname: host name/address mismatch: ::ffff:10.1.2.3 != myhost.mydom.com and the client is not allowed to mount the share.\r\n\r\n* Over Samba and NFS only 15 secondary groups are in effect. Make it at least 16\r\n", "shortname": "samba-rx", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Fixes and workarounds for some problems in the Samba and windows area", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 772226}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/samba-rx/", "video_url": ""}
