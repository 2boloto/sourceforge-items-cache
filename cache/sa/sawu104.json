This editor is capable to represent all the weaveable patterns and more. In other terms, it is up to you to check if the patterns drawn can be physically created, without endless loops of threads etc. Its original use is to document an artifact (parts of which may be missing) in a museum, without damage to it. The curator, while trying to understand the artifact, can create tentative structures in the editor and correct them locally, like modifying links between crossings. You can print .pdf files showing the whole internal structure if the weaving, lace etc. or just the top layer.", "shortname": "sawu104", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Generic textile / knot diagram / thread topology editor", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2053392}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sawu104/", "video_url": ""}
