This program first attempts repair any zip based corruption. From there it engages in four different algorithmic attempts at repair or recovery.\r\n\r\nWith the first method using validation, the location of the first XML error is sought. At that point the sub-files are truncated and repaired. The second method works the same way except the XML validation is more lax. With the third, the strict XML validation is returned to and corrupt XML sub-files are truncated and repaired as before however, missing XML sub-files are brought in from blank full healthy docx, xlsx or pptx of the respective correct extension. The fourth method uses SilverCoder's DocToText to salvage text or data after which the file is opened as an old style MS Office 97 - 2003 format file including the naked recovered text or data.\r\n\r\nSee my other projects here on Sourceforge for other ways to recover corrupt MS and Open Office files.", "shortname": "savvyoffice", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Repairs/Recovers Corrupt MS Office 2007 - 2013 Format Files", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1888767}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/savvyoffice/", "video_url": ""}
