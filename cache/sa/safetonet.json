It can also be used as stand-alone kiosk software.\r\n\r\nSafeToNet runs from CD or a USB Flash Drive using the PC's memory, rather than installing and loading from the hard disk drive. It can run on a computer without a hard disk drive, or even one with a corrupted hard disk drive or file system.\r\n\r\nSafeToNet is Linux based and because it is not installed it is immune to viruses and other malicious infections that could otherwise expose your personal data. No changes are made to the existing operating system on the host computer and when you exit SafeToNet it returns to its previous state.\r\n\r\nIt operates on low spec computers enabling older computers to be dedicated to online use. \r\n\r\nSafeToNet is built with Tiny Core (v6) Linux and uses the Mozilla Firefox (v36.0) web browser. This is configured to be unchangeable and therefore it cannot be attacked, hacked or cracked. \r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "safetonet", "_id": "528cd2e81be1ce4df7d4e667", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2013481, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "SafeToNet Linux Operating System", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: OS distribution :: Live CD", "shortname": "livecd", "fullname": "Live CD", "id": 799}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
