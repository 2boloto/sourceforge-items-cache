It is seeded with a 480-bit key and  a 480-bit nonce. The target technology is a stream cipher. Each call to ::Invoke()  returns a 32bit word. On a desktop workstation, SALMON runs at around 2.58 million  invocations per SECOND. A stream cipher built on this PRNG could encrypt over 600 megabytes per minute.\r\n\r\nSALMON is heavily derived from a block cipher called SERPENT. SERPENT was a finalist from  the NIST selection tournaments.\r\n\t\r\nSALMON is not just a SERPENT cipher operating in chaining mode. It contains five large, hidden tables organized in the manner of blowfish substitution tables. There is also mild use of a portion of Salsa20/12 called a \"quarter round function\". The seeding portion relies on SHA-2 (the standard hash function of the NSA.)", "shortname": "salmoncipher", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Cryptographic PRNG", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2465343}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/salmoncipher/", "video_url": null}
