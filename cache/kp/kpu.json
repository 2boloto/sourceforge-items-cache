Almost any encryption is possible, including \"none at all\". The trick is that a computer famously and happily takes garbage in and puts garbage out, just as happily as it does \"2+2=4\", so all we have to do is change our OWN idea of what is garbage and what is sense and the computer will remain happy but we then have a means of doing computation in public that looks like garbage to everyone else, but which means \"2+2=4\" to us alone. The US government  does not control the conversions we do in our own mind in order to make meaningful sense of what we see, so it has nothing to say about the matter. This project will build a cryptoprocessor that is configurable to work with encryptions of your own choosing but any encryption you do for it or choose to build into it is your own business. There's no encryption here!", "shortname": "kpu", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Cryptoprocessor design and documentation", "tools": [{"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 800922}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kpu/", "video_url": null}
