It was later rewritten to C++ in July 1999 through Jan 2000.\r\n\r\nWhile it's been freely available since its creation, it's being released here as an open-source project so the world can better use it as it sees fit.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0 is completely reworked in 2014 to compile and run with GCC and STL to make it fully portable and accessible to all computer platforms.\r\n", "shortname": "m6811dis", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "M6811 Code-Seeking Disassembler", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2259422}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/m6811dis/", "video_url": null}
