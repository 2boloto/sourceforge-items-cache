You and your doctor or nurse agree up on some \"markers\" to track. You then setup these markers.\r\n\r\n2.    You agree upon how often you should email the marker data to your nurse or doctor (probably monthly), if you should email it as text data or chart images, and to what email address you should send it to.\r\n\r\n3.    You enter data for the markers every day or as often as you can\r\n\r\n4.    You email the data to your nurse or doctor as agreed\r\n\r\n5.
