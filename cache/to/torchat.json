After a delayed time that takes a couple of seconds or minutes (depending on how far is the contact you want to connect to), the application will add the contact in the list and enable you to start chatting.\r\n\r\nThe program runs from any USB hard drive, so it will not affect your computer performance nor interact with any other software installed onto your system.\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "torchat", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/torchat4windows/", "username": "torchat4windows", "name": "tor chat"}], "external_homepage": "http://torchat.sourceforge.net"}
