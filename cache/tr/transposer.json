No bugs reported since last BETA, so nothing to fix at this point.\r\n\r\n(0.56) was the first with a mechanism for creating an ignore list of words which might get transposed if they are on a line by themselves, such as, \"ending\". This word is typically made of characters which are valid chord characters that would otherwise be transposed.\r\n\r\nThere are two editing panes in the main window. One is for the original song, and the other is for the transposed song. \r\n\r\nEarlier versions of this program were command line only (CLI), then I used QT to augment my C++ source to create a GUI.\r\n\r\nThis project is now developed in Lazarus, using a collaborative approach.
