Included as FTP server, SMTP server or POP server. As HTTP web extention and more. Trapgate was first a echo/netmail exchange mailer with small files  now you can send and receive files from huge size and connect it to a newsgroup, usenet, use email and echomail/netmail or mix them, use a gateway from echo/netmail to newsgroups etc. The look (skin) has be changed and it shows filesizes in Bytes, KB, MB, GB and not only Bytes or CPS. Also the transferspeed has increased, however version 2.00 is still in beta test, so report errors so that i can correct them fast. We did feel that ZLIB is still the best compression for data transfers and encrypted, if you like to become a beta tester just let us know using the Forum. If you like to donate please do. About bugs i can't solve them if i do not have the knowledge that there is a BUG so report one. \r\n\r\nBest regards\r\nFrans Lupschen\r\n2:280/126\r\n ", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trapgatemailer", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/slip7855brzlstr/", "username": "slip7855brzlstr", "name": "Darkmaster"}], "external_homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/p/trapgatemailer"}
