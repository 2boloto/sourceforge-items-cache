It lets you categorize each recorded interval by a client/task and a free text. Of course, the list of clients/tasks can be edited to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you wish, your flexible time account is taken care of: you always see how much you worked. You can also keep an eye on how much work time is left for today (by a notification which you can enable).\r\n\r\nYou even may provide the geo-coordinates of your work place and the app can automatically clock you in while you are at work! This is done without using GPS, so your battery won't be emptied by this app!\r\n\r\nThis is an open source project, so if there is something you don't like, you are very welcome to contact me or even write some code yourself and contribute it. Please don't try to communicate with me via reviews on Google Play or AndroidPit, that doesn't work in both directions. Just write me an email, and I'll see what I can do.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trackworktime", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/zephyrsoft/", "username": "zephyrsoft", "name": "ZephyrSoft"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jan-e1/", "username": "jan-e1", "name": "Jan"}], "external_homepage": "http://zephyrsoft.org/trackworktime"}
