Or you're a company\r\ntracking issues of their customers -- the customer may run their own\r\nissue tracker and certain issues in the customer's tracker are for you.\r\n\r\nThis project solves this requirement. Currently the local issue tracker\r\n(the one *you* are running) is limited to roundup_, an open source issue\r\ntracker. For the remote tracker we're currently supporting KPMweb, the\r\nissue tracker run by VW/Audi with access for their suppliers -- if\r\nyou're one of them you know how to access it. Other remote trackers are\r\ncurrently being implemented, notably support for jira_.\r\n", "shortname": "trackersync", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Issue Tracker Synchronisation Tool", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2444528}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/trackersync/", "video_url": null}
