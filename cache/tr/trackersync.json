Or you're a company\r\ntracking issues of their customers -- the customer may run their own\r\nissue tracker and certain issues in the customer's tracker are for you.\r\n\r\nThis project solves this requirement. Currently the local issue tracker\r\n(the one *you* are running) is limited to roundup_, an open source issue\r\ntracker. For the remote tracker we're currently supporting KPMweb, the\r\nissue tracker run by VW/Audi with access for their suppliers -- if\r\nyou're one of them you know how to access it. Other remote trackers are\r\ncurrently being implemented, notably support for jira_.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trackersync", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/schlatterbeck/", "username": "schlatterbeck", "name": "Ralf Schlatterbeck"}], "external_homepage": "http://trackersync.sourceforge.net"}
