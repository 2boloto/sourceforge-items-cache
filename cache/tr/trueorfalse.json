You may need to recompile it as you run it.\r\n\r\nThis program is made to determine which documents are true and which documents are false. User is supposed to input 2 true documents and one false document, while the program needs to determine based on those settings which other documents fall into a such true/false category. \r\n\r\nHow does this work?\r\nAccording to a logical implication, the following holds:\r\n1. false implies anything\r\n2. true implies only true\r\n\r\nWhen document is trained in certain ways, the limits are obtained. According to those limits, if the implication rule holds, then we can say that document is true. If it doesn't hold, it isn't true enough thus it is sorted as false.\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trueorfalse", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/damir-olejar/", "username": "damir-olejar", "name": "Damir Olejar"}], "external_homepage": ""}
