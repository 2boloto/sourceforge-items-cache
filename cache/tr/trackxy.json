I released TrackXY to reduce barriers to entry to science.\r\n\r\nPlanned features include versions for each platform, a GUI, comprehensive data management, and data analysis tools.\r\n\r\nTo analyze motion in /recorded/ video (not real-time), you may prefer something like PhysMo, also a SourceForge project.", "shortname": "trackxy", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Track & log x & y displacement, in realtime, of object in webcam", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1031824}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/trackxy/", "video_url": ""}
