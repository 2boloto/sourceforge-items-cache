Addition, subtraction, multiplcation, division, and exponentiation are all implemented in the algebra as overloaded operators.  They can also compute with maps, a map being an array of TPSA objects representing a mapping of a space into itself.  They are implemented as arrays of TPSA objects equal in number to the number of variables of the algebra.  One implementation is written in Mathematica and is rather slow.  The second is written in VB.net and is much faster.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trpwrseralg", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/towne56/", "username": "towne56", "name": "Nathan Towne"}], "external_homepage": ""}
