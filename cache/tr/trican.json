Code is expected to include 2 or more 'branches' to provide different types of functionality - The first being simply a logger that sends the information to a PC where a simple program will save the data to a file.  The second will allow the device to function as a standalone interface between the vehicle and a permanently mounted PC, performing functions as needed.\r\n\r\nThe specific purpose serving as an impetus to the project : to allow an automotive dash-mount PC to perform all needed functions previously performed by the AV/Nav unit, thereby allowing that unit to be replaced without significant loss of functionality.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trican", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/defiancecp/", "username": "defiancecp", "name": "Defiance"}], "external_homepage": ""}
