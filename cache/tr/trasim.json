It comes with an algorithm that handles traffic lights dynamically, based on the presence of cars and pedestrians. Both cars and pedestrians can be spawned randomly; however, user interaction is also supported for both entities (e.g. to control destination, crossing decisions). Features such as distributed user interaction were originally left as future work; however, interaction with the main application via sockets is already supported.", "shortname": "trasim", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 248327}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/trasim/", "video_url": ""}
