It comes with an algorithm that handles traffic lights dynamically, based on the presence of cars and pedestrians. Both cars and pedestrians can be spawned randomly; however, user interaction is also supported for both entities (e.g. to control destination, crossing decisions). Features such as distributed user interaction were originally left as future work; however, interaction with the main application via sockets is already supported.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trasim", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gamvrosi/", "username": "gamvrosi", "name": "Georgios Amvrosiadis"}], "external_homepage": "http://trasim.sourceforge.net"}
