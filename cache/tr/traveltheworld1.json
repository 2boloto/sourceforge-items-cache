Words to life by. Do you feel as though you are not more of a fumbler than a seizer in your career?

Traveling may be your way to clarity. Jobs where you travel can unlock that option.\r\n\r\nI was in India when a funeral procession passes me on a crowded street, a closely knitted group of men balancing a shrouded body above their heads. I could have touched them, they passed by so closely. You see, I had one of those jobs that travel the world.
