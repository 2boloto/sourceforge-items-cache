It can run in collaborative mode (together with trickled) or in stand alone mode.\r\n\r\ntrickle works by taking advantage of the unix loader preloading.

It then limits traffic based on delaying the sending and receiving of data over a socket. trickle runs entirely in userspace and does not require root privileges.", "shortname": "trickled", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A command line utility for throttling bandwidth of processes", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2369872}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/trickled/", "video_url": null}
