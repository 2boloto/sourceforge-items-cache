It then limits traffic based on delaying the sending and receiving of data over a socket. trickle runs entirely in userspace and does not require root privileges.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trickled", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/slicer69/", "username": "slicer69", "name": "Jesse Smith"}], "external_homepage": "http://trickled.sourceforge.net"}
