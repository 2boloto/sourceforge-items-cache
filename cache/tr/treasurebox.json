The system is similar to how a file management system organizes files and folders on your computer's storage devices.  Items can be associated with zero, one or more images.  All the data associated with an item as well as the names of the item images are stored in a MySQL database on the users PC.\r\n\r\nOther things I found useful to photograph were items on shelves like books or CDs. By providing a zoom and rotate features I was able to browse my books or CDs on my shelves anywhere in the house.  The more I used the program the more features I wanted to add.\r\n\r\nThe program is fairly generic and can be used for a variety of collections within a tree structure.  Digital images are easy to take and cost very little to store.  Treasure Box can help you organize your treasures and help you find them when you need them.", "shortname": "treasurebox", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Organizes and searches user-defined items and images in a MySQL DB.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1326044}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/treasurebox/", "video_url": ""}
