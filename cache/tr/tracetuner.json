Originally developed by Paracel, a Celera Business, this code base was released as open source in 2006. TraceTuner was used by Celera to call 30+ million reads from both Drosophila and human genome sequencing projects. In 2000, Applied Biosystems bundled TraceTuner with ABI3700 Genome Analyzers and shipped it to the customers of these capillary electrophoresis sequencers. Later versions of TraceTuner, which support mixed base calling, have been used by the research community, the private biotech sector, and the U.S. government as components of different variant detection, genotyping and forensic software applications (e.g. Applied Biosystems SeqScape, Paracel Genome Assembler, MTexpert, etc.).
