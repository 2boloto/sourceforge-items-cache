Most of those fields have been created with names that reflect the name of the form they are used in. A few fields used are part of the default 100 custom fields that come with Encompass360. While it is unlikely you would have created custom fields with the same name as those found on this form, you may easily have already defined and use the Encompass360 default custom fields. When you save this form to Encompass360, the fields that are a part of the form will overwrite any fields with the same name that you already have. It is imperative that you import and completely vet these forms in your sandbox testing server. If you haven't defined any of the default custom fields then you should have no problems. Also, if you don't have a sandbox server, you should call your Ellie Mae sales rep and ask for one. \r\n", "shortname": "trailingdoctrac", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Lock down positions for trust account income and expenses.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 979664}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/trailingdoctrac/", "video_url": ""}
