It is simple, user-friendly, pragmatic and not limited to IT. TRAK has won an INCOSE award and is also a finalist in the 2011 IET innovation awards.\r\n\r\nTRAK allows you to describe a system, its parts (which can include people, software, other systems and physical things) and how it relates to the residual world. It covers everything from the enterprise and its goals to the concept to the procurement of the solution via projects and the introduction or withdrawal of the system from service. \r\n\r\nTRAK is a derivative of MODAF but is based on ISO/IEC 42010 - the international standard for architecture description. There is a minimal process in which the architect selects the viewpoints (specifications for views) that address the task sponsor's concerns. It has rules that ensure that the description is consistent and also readable by the non technical audience.
