Comparing to the other natural languages, TRIA is a geometrical symbolic system which is more mathematic oriented. It is a simplified and geometric figure evolution of natural language symbols.  Comparing to the typical dot symbolic language braille which is a binary encoding system, but TRIA is a ternary encoding system. And TRIA is also easier to learn and input comparing to Braille. A portable coin sized TRIA keyboard with 3 or 4 touch endpoints can be designed. It can be used to replace the traditional 101 QWERT keyboard keys in special devices.\r\nTRIA can be used as a wearable device gesture language, with the flat surface input and 3D input to facilitate the information exchange. With the 4 endpoints routes and unified encoding rules, it is easy to learn and understanding. It can be used in different TRIA adaptable devices.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tria", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/caixnet/", "username": "caixnet", "name": "daway cai"}], "external_homepage": "http://youtu.be/h2YsgOuO2fU"}
