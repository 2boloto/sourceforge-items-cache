Comparing to the other natural languages, TRIA is a geometrical symbolic system which is more mathematic oriented. It is a simplified and geometric figure evolution of natural language symbols.  Comparing to the typical dot symbolic language braille which is a binary encoding system, but TRIA is a ternary encoding system. And TRIA is also easier to learn and input comparing to Braille. A portable coin sized TRIA keyboard with 3 or 4 touch endpoints can be designed. It can be used to replace the traditional 101 QWERT keyboard keys in special devices.\r\nTRIA can be used as a wearable device gesture language, with the flat surface input and 3D input to facilitate the information exchange. With the 4 endpoints routes and unified encoding rules, it is easy to learn and understanding. It can be used in different TRIA adaptable devices.\r\n", "shortname": "tria", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Wearable Symbol Language", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1988370}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tria/", "video_url": ""}
