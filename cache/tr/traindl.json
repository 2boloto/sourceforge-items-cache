The filer server limits the download speed to a slow value, say 100 kBps. So I use a download accelerator using which I can download the video speedily (more connections simultaneously). But all the available download accelerators (in my experience) divides the file to equal segments and starts downloading those segments. That means I cannot start watching the video if the each segment download rate is high. To resolve this issue I wrote a shell script which downloads a file in a linear fashion. That means the 8 threads will first download the first 8 segments of 2 MB size (can be customized) and then they will move to next  segments. It worked for me. You can use it too.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "traindl", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/saketdas/", "username": "saketdas", "name": "Saket Das"}], "external_homepage": "http://traindl.sourceforge.net"}
