The filer server limits the download speed to a slow value, say 100 kBps. So I use a download accelerator using which I can download the video speedily (more connections simultaneously). But all the available download accelerators (in my experience) divides the file to equal segments and starts downloading those segments. That means I cannot start watching the video if the each segment download rate is high. To resolve this issue I wrote a shell script which downloads a file in a linear fashion. That means the 8 threads will first download the first 8 segments of 2 MB size (can be customized) and then they will move to next  segments. It worked for me. You can use it too.", "shortname": "traindl", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Almost linear download accelerator", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2389842}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/traindl/", "video_url": null}
