Basic controls supplied and aggregation support makes it even easier. \r\n- We use layered windows as host windows, so, transparency of host windows is fully supported. \r\n\r\nAnd, it is evolving and is regularly updated. \r\n\r\nv2.2.1\r\n------\r\n- Bug fix.\r\n- Add scroll/offset mechanism to accelerate animation.\r\n- Add manual layout mechanism to accelerate layouting of frames of which the position is changed constantly.", "shortname": "xuilib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An efficient, flexible and easy-to-use windows UI library.
