Major design goal was minimalistic size and maximum speed.\r\n\r\nTiny 320 code-lines offer a parser plus bytecode-generator, 26 mathematical functions and 17 supported base-types including complex and arbitrary MPFR-multiprecision. Both parser and bytecode may run in threads.\r\n\r\nThe usage of ATMSP is most simple - just include a single header in your own code and go. Reasonably experienced coders may implement other base-types like bool, SSE2, rationals or bigint's with a few changes.\r\n\r\nHave fun, Heinz van Saanen", "shortname": "atmsp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "ATMSP - A Tiny Mathematical Speed Parser", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 666111}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atmsp/", "video_url": ""}
