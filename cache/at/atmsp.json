Major design goal was minimalistic size and maximum speed.\r\n\r\nTiny 320 code-lines offer a parser plus bytecode-generator, 26 mathematical functions and 17 supported base-types including complex and arbitrary MPFR-multiprecision. Both parser and bytecode may run in threads.\r\n\r\nThe usage of ATMSP is most simple - just include a single header in your own code and go. Reasonably experienced coders may implement other base-types like bool, SSE2, rationals or bigint's with a few changes.\r\n\r\nHave fun, Heinz van Saanen", "summary": "ATMSP - A Tiny Mathematical Speed Parser", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 666111, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "atmsp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/heinzvs/", "username": "heinzvs", "name": "Heinz van Saanen"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics", "fullname": "Mathematics", "shortname": "mathematics", "id": 98}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "id": 770}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Apple Mac OS Classic", "fullname": "Apple Mac OS Classic", "shortname": "macos9", "id": 311}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Other", "fullname": "Other", "shortname": "other", "id": 212}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
