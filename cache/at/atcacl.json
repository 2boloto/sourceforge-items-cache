Once set up the commands are; dhcp0, dhcp1, idown, torstart, and torstop. dhcp0 and dhcp1 take down the eth0 and eth1 interfaces, randomize the MACs, bring the interfaces back up, and connect with dhcp again. idown shuts the interfaces down (including wlan0, wlan1), randomizes the MACs, and takes no further action. torstart starts tor and privoxy. torstop stops tor and privoxy. These are just useful scripts to make such operations easy commands, they are a convenience tool and use other programs to do the real jobs. Also included are instructions on how to have your MAC randomized on boot.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "atcacl", "_id": "5465f1b00910d462ec05bc7a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2362937, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Misc sysv boot scripts and wrappers for security and/or convienence", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "id": 253}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "id": 238}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
