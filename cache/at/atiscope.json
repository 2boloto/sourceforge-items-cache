SCOPE incorporates an open source traffic signal control program developed by Advanced Technologies, Incorporated.  SCOPE has pre-timed and actuated control modes.  In has min recall, max recall, gap out, max gap, and presence modes that include advanced traffic control concepts.  SCOPE interfaces with both NEMA-TS2 and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) traffic cabinets.  SCOPE executes under Linux or Windows.  Currently it runs on a Linux  based PC (used for concept and unit testing), a PowerPC prototype board with various I/O connectors (used for integration testing) and an Advanced Traffic Controller.  SCOPE has the ability to simulate 64 traffic sensors and 8 pedestrian calls.  It has several menu options to facilitate real time logging and debugging.  SCOPE is easily ported to any platform and has wireless Android Tablet / Java PC interfaces.", "summary": "Open Source Traffic Control Software", "tools": [{"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "SCOPE FILES"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1040449, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "atiscope", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mgardinier/", "username": "mgardinier", "name": "Mark Gardinier"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atiscope/screenshot/tablet.png", "caption": "Android Tablet", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atiscope/screenshot/tablet.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atiscope/screenshot/ATC.png", "caption": "Running on ATC", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atiscope/screenshot/ATC.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atiscope/screenshot/newscreen.jpg", "caption": "Main Status", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atiscope/screenshot/newscreen.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "https://sites.google.com/site/atiscope/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java SWT", "fullname": "Java SWT", "shortname": "ui_swt", "id": 472}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Ada", "fullname": "Ada", "shortname": "ada", "id": 163}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "id": 15}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "id": 97}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Automotive", "fullname": "Automotive", "shortname": "automotive", "id": 768}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}]}}
