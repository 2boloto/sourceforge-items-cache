SCOPE incorporates an open source traffic signal control program developed by Advanced Technologies, Incorporated.  SCOPE has pre-timed and actuated control modes.  In has min recall, max recall, gap out, max gap, and presence modes that include advanced traffic control concepts.  SCOPE interfaces with both NEMA-TS2 and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) traffic cabinets.  SCOPE executes under Linux or Windows.  Currently it runs on a Linux  based PC (used for concept and unit testing), a PowerPC prototype board with various I/O connectors (used for integration testing) and an Advanced Traffic Controller.  SCOPE has the ability to simulate 64 traffic sensors and 8 pedestrian calls.  It has several menu options to facilitate real time logging and debugging.  SCOPE is easily ported to any platform and has wireless Android Tablet / Java PC interfaces.", "shortname": "atiscope", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Open Source Traffic Control Software", "tools": [{"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "SCOPE FILES", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1040449}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atiscope/", "video_url": ""}
