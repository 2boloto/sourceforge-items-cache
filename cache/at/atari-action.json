Action! was created by Clinton Parker and released on cartridge by Optimized Systems Software in 1983. Its syntax is similar to that of ALGOL 68.\r\n\r\nAction! is significant for its high performance, which allows games and graphics demos to be written in a high-level language without use of hand-written assembly language code. Action! language constructs were designed to map cleanly to 6502 opcodes.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, Clinton Parker has release the Action! 3.6 source code to the public under the terms of GPL. This project is intended to preserve the Action! source code and to provide updates and fixes for known bugs.\r\n\r\nSee http://atariage.com/forums/topic/217770-action-source-code/ for discussions.", "summary": "Action! - The Native Programming Language for Atari 8-bit Computers", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2404002, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "atari-action", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/peterdell/", "username": "peterdell", "name": "Peter Dell"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://atari-action.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
