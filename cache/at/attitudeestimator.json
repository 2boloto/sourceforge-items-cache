Up to 3-axis gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer data can be processed into a full 3D quaternion orientation estimate, with the use of a nonlinear Passive Complementary Filter. The library is targeted at robotic applications, but is by no means limited to this. Features of the estimator include gyro bias estimation, transient quick learning, multiple estimation algorithms, tuneable estimator parameters, and near-global stability backed by theoretical analysis.\r\n\r\nGreat emphasis has been placed on having a very efficient, yet totally numerically and algorithmically robust implementation of the filter. The code size has also been kept to a minimum, and has been extremely well-commented. The programmatic interface has also been made as easy as possible. Please refer to the extensive documentation of the library for more information on its capabilities and usage caveats.", "shortname": "attitudeestimator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A C++ implementation of a nonlinear 3D IMU fusion algorithm.", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2229068}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/attitudeestimator/", "video_url": null}
