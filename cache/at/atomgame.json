You are the almighty atom with 111 electrons - but, you're extremely unstable. You must fire electrons at the enemy to destroy the Helium-2 atoms and steal their electrons trying to survive in the nuclear prison you're in.\r\nObjective: You must try and survive as long as you can in the arena-area and rack up as many points as possible. You will be given collectable upgrades throughout the gameplay and will encounter a number of enemies that spawn, trying to reduce you to mear sub-atomic particles in a thermo-nuclear fission that will blow your mind!\r\nEnjoy!\r\nControls:\r\nW - To move upwards\r\nS - To move downwards\r\nA - To move to the left\r\nD - To move to the right\r\nP - To pause the game\r\nMouse - To aim\r\nLeft Mouse Button - To fire\r\nEsc - To exit the game\r\n(Also, you can use F9 to take a screenshot of the game.)\r\nWARNING: ATOMS NOT TO SCALE.", "summary": "A small, extremely addictive, arcade-style game.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 738469, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "atomgame", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/thechosenzakk/", "username": "thechosenzakk", "name": "Zakk"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atomgame/screenshot/Atom%202012-04-03%2016-17-46-27.png", "caption": "The player and the HUD shown, as the player shoots at the onslaught of enemies.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atomgame/screenshot/Atom%202012-04-03%2016-17-46-27.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atomgame/screenshot/Atom%202012-04-03%2016-17-56-27.png", "caption": "More incoming enemies.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atomgame/screenshot/Atom%202012-04-03%2016-17-56-27.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atomgame/screenshot/Atom%202012-04-03%2016-18-16-27.png", "caption": "The arena boundary is shown here.
