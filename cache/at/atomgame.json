You will be given collectable upgrades throughout the gameplay and will encounter a number of enemies that spawn, trying to reduce you to mear sub-atomic particles in a thermo-nuclear fission that will blow your mind!\r\nEnjoy!\r\nControls:\r\nW - To move upwards\r\nS - To move downwards\r\nA - To move to the left\r\nD - To move to the right\r\nP - To pause the game\r\nMouse - To aim\r\nLeft Mouse Button - To fire\r\nEsc - To exit the game\r\n(Also, you can use F9 to take a screenshot of the game.)\r\nWARNING: ATOMS NOT TO SCALE.", "shortname": "atomgame", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A small, extremely addictive, arcade-style game.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 738469}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/atomgame/", "video_url": ""}
