You will be given collectable upgrades throughout the gameplay and will encounter a number of enemies that spawn, trying to reduce you to mear sub-atomic particles in a thermo-nuclear fission that will blow your mind!\r\nEnjoy!\r\nControls:\r\nW - To move upwards\r\nS - To move downwards\r\nA - To move to the left\r\nD - To move to the right\r\nP - To pause the game\r\nMouse - To aim\r\nLeft Mouse Button - To fire\r\nEsc - To exit the game\r\n(Also, you can use F9 to take a screenshot of the game.)\r\nWARNING: ATOMS NOT TO SCALE.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "atomgame", "_id": "4f7b1050b9363c091e000379", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 738469, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A small, extremely addictive, arcade-style game.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "shortname": "sidescrolling", "fullname": "Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "id": 288}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Multiplayer", "shortname": "multiplayer", "fullname": "Multiplayer", "id": 774}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
