ATS can test any program that can signal success or failure via its exit status.\r\nATS is an object-oriented Python program that provides abstractions for user defined tests (usually specified with an executable and command line and / or an input file). It runs these tests, either in serial or in parallel, and creates a log file (or files) describing the results of running the tests. ATS provides the capability to run serial or parallel tests simultaneously up to the resource limits it has been given (i.e. some number of processors on which to run).  Tests can be given a priority rating and be dependent upon other tests, and these features are accounted for in its scheduling algorithm. The software is configurable and extensible. ATS provides numerous options for creating dependent chains of tests, filtering based on various criteria, and running tests with custom arguments.", "shortname": "ats-automatedtestingsystem", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Object oriented Python-based tool for test automation.", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2045248}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ats-automatedtestingsystem/", "video_url": ""}
