The scripts require no knowledge of programming, and can be applied to genome sequences of model or non-model species. We suggest a workflow in which genes of interest are first identified from previous studies and publicly available datasets of functional gene annotation. Once a list of candidate genes has been identified, their sequences are selected from the reference genome. These sequences are used as a query during a BLAST search of the unannotated genome of a non-model species, and then the corresponding sequences are returned, which can be used to design baits for hybridization-based sequence capture.", "shortname": "seqselector", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Tools to select sequences for capture enrichment of next-gen libraries", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2057230}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/seqselector/", "video_url": null}
