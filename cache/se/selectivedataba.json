This program directly copies any files/folders you list, to an empty folder.  It copies the entire folder structure, so you know exactly where your files and everything backed up, are/were.\r\n\r\nNow, also included in this is my Password Safe program.  Store all your passwords in 1 convenient location.  But, wait \"wouldn't that be dangerous?\", NOPE!  It's all encrypted useing my special Cypher Encryption Algorithm: basically, you have to have the password, or you'll never see your data again!  This also means that ONLY YOU get to see your passwords/accounts.  So, if you don't feel like memorizeing 47 accounts (like I), then download this thing!  lol I included a random password generator to go along.  Any length, include any characters!
