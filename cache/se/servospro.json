It is a modern dynamic system which can dynamically load and unload executable modules at runtime on or having a minimal hardware requirement. The versatile modular approach using LZMA compression technology makes SERVOS one of the best highly compressed operating system in the history. SERVOS modules are specially designed to be much smaller than any other compressed packages available nowadays, and through the use of a Monolithic Kernel Design, speed of decompression remains usually faster than reading the full data from disk.
