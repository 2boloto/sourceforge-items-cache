Simulation results shows that the Enhanced-SEP protocol achieves better performance in this respect, compared to other existing clustering algorithms such as LEACH and SEP in both heterogeneous and homogenous environments.", "shortname": "sepe", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An enhanced stable election protocol for wireless sensor network ", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1291692}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sepe/", "video_url": ""}
