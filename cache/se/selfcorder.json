Thus, SelfCorder was born.\r\nIt allows you to choose an audio file, and record a video while the audio is simultaneously playing. You can record yourself in a quiet environment using earphones. The high-quality recording can be used as an audition tape of yourself. On speakers, the audio will interfere, so unless that is what you want, I recommend earphones.\r\n\r\nThe application has been programmed using Apache Cordova, so if anyone wants to port the app to iOS or other mobile platforms, it should be straightforward to do so.
