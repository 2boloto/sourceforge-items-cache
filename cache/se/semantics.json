It is an enhancement of the Vector-Space analysis found withing the Classifier4j, which does not take into account the semantic meanings of the words. Furthermore, the Vector-Space analysis of the Classifier4J does not work well with the short sentences, while this enhancement does. A new dictionary of categories based on the EOWL list of words was developed, while the categories for each word from the DISCO's semantics were calculated.\r\n\r\nThe result is a tool that is more stable and several gigabytes smaller than DISCO, yet more powerful than the Classifier4j's Vector-Space analysis. \r\n\r\nPLEASE BE AWARE: There are 98,376 words in a collection, and each word has the unique directory and a TXT file.
