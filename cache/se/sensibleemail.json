(by folder, by sender, by default)\r\nMany features designed to make reading Mailing Lists easier. (Wizard filter creator for instance)\r\nTags on msgs can be used to control font/color of each individual field (Subject, From, etc...) as well as performing actions when the tag is applied or removed.
