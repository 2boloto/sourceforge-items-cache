The File Duplicate Explorer is working. From now on I'll be doing UX stuff.\r\n\r\nDouble File is an application that saves hashed directory listings of all the files on your drives before you store them offsite. You can analyze these backups keeping them safe. Down the road you won't be locked into using any one backup strategy. Using C# WPF and MVVM. SearchDirLists is incorporated into Double File for now; but if you've been using SearchDirLists you'll have to use the original download for that, still available here.\r\n\r\nSaving listings for your drives can now take a half hour or an hour or more because it is creating a hash of all the files. At the moment you will be rewarded with a much nicer saving listings and listing browse experience.
