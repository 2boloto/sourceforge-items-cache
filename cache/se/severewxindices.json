It allows you to easily view severe weather indices from Unisys and displays the related SPC's Skew-T for comparison to help you see which stations have the potential for severe weather.

Conditions can always change, and you must evaluate the atmosphere as a whole and check CAP/CIN. Remember to check upstream stations and consider advection.
