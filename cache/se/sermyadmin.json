After three years of development, the project no longer makes sense. The main reason to create the serMyAdmin was the lack of a GUI for OpenSER/OpenSIPS. The OpenSIPS control panel fulfill this need and it is not wise to maintain two GUI projects. Our team will support the opensips-cp initiative to avoid splitting the community between two open source projects for OpenSIPS GUI. I would like to say thanks to all the people that in some way contributed with the project. The svn code is available to anyone who wants to maintain the project.  \r\nMost of our development efforts are now focused in a new commercial product based on OpenSIPS called SIP Pulse, completely rewritten in Java and Glassfish www.sippulse.com supporting pre and post paid users with billing and reseller portal.", "shortname": "sermyadmin", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Web interface for OpenSIPS", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 204535}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Feature Requests", "mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sermyadmin/", "video_url": ""}
