wouldn't work with Day to Day usage such as multimedia needs or may be some other usages so I decided to make a new Penetration Testing Distro which can be used for other activities as well other than Penetration Testing.\r\n\r\nNow please don't be so harsh since this is my first attempt in making new Distro & I am alone working on it so I will appreciate any help/Suggestions/Guidance I can get.\r\n\r\nThank You\r\nHemant", "shortname": "seikaos", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active",
