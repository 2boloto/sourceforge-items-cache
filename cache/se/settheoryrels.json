A relation is a set of ordered pairs. A relation can have properties, including that it is reflexive, symmetric, or transitive. The classes enable some ordered pairs to be stated, and will deduce all the other related ordered pairs implied by the relation's properties. There are implementations of transitive, reflexive-and-transitive, and symmetric-reflexive-and-transitive (equivalence) relations using hash sets and tree sets.\r\n\r\nThe current version (0.1) has been tested but not substantially used.
