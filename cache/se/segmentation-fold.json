Knowledge about the 2D structures of these molecules could help give an idea how they exactly function. The prediction of such 2D structures is an important field of research. In RNA a special type of structure has been reported, the K-turn. This is an extraordinary binding motif characterized by non-canonical bonds. Because of its rare occurrence and its non-canonical bonds current folding programs are not capable to predict it. In this report we propose a solution; a modification of the Zuker algorithm. We estimated our parameters computationally and our findings show that it has an accuracy of about 85%. The proposed solution can also be applied to different bound motifs in RNA which must be enclosed by paired bases. The program is available under an open source license and free available.
