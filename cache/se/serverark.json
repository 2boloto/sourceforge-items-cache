Flood attacks on gaming servers are typically designed to make the players on the server lag to the point where the game is not playable.  It can even crash some game servers.\r\n\r\nServerArk automatically detects when a UDP flood attack occurs and uses kernel-level iptables rules to dynamically block those packets from being processed by the game server at all.  It essentially lifts the game server \"above the flood\" and allows the game to still be playable, even under very heavy attacks.\r\n\r\nIt can be run interactively with a high level of verbosity (to watch its logic in action), or it can be run unobtrusively as a daemon with output to daily log files (typical usage).", "shortname": "serverark", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Linux game server UDP flood analyzer and protector", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 699772}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/serverark/", "video_url": ""}
