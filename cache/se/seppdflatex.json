The Table of Contents and LOF and LOT are made for all chapters, and the TOC, LOF, LOT are all hyperlinked to the correct external PDF chapter files using zr-ref and xr packages from CTAN.  But you have to write the correct LaTeX source.  The script seppdflatex does the compilation and formatting of Table of Contents and such-like and separates out the chapters as standalone PDF files.
