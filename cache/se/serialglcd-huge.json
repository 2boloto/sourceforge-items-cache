It is separated by many lines.\r\n\r\nDescription of main new functions:\r\n\r\nDraw_BMP_Ram(). this is the main new function. It is very big and complicated. The reason is that display hardware is designed to be used in vertical position (I think), so it is very easy to draw in vertical direction, but difficult in a horizontal way.\r\n\r\nprint_char(). This function has been modified, in order to support this Display. It is easy to modify it to support both displays (160x128 and 128x64).\r\n\r\nDraw_BMP_Progmem() is intended to display images stored in flash memory.
