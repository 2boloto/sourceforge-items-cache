The tool will search .odt files by date and content.\r\nOD-What?\r\n.odt files are a particular kind of file, many word-processor programs can save to .odt file format.\r\nWhy .odt and not .doc or .txt?\r\nSearch-ODT was developed at request as the subject of an independent study course. No other reason. Due to the modular structure of the project it is possible to adapt Search-ODT into a more general search tool.\r\nWhy publish Search-ODT here?\r\nSearch-ODT is posted here only as a portfolio example. This project was a team project, \r\nConclusion\r\nAs stated on the final poster our \u201cobjective was to design and implement an open source program that preforms an ad hoc search for .odt files by content and date. The program Search-ODT has a graphical user interface referred to as a GUI. The search tool is composed of two main parts. The first part is the search engine wrapper. The second part is the afore mentioned GUI...\"", "shortname": "search-odt", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Independent Study Course Project:Search .odt files by date and content", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1852599}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/search-odt/", "video_url": ""}
