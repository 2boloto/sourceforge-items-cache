In this file system we can highlight interested files with an expiration date so that they may get deleted or moved to a special location where we can attend to them and clear off what we do not want anymore. A separate data structure per file is used to store additional attributes about each file created in this file system and desired behavior is achieved by modifying these attributes accordingly. These additional attributes are saved in the Extended File Attributes which is a file system feature supported by most of the Linux file systems.
