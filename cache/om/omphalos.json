Omphalos makes use of passive and active portscanning, DNS/DHCP/Zeroconf server interrogation, portknock detection, covert channel detection and establishment, ARP scanning, automatic WEP cracking, man-in-the-middling, and a whole host of other tricks. GPS integration? Oh yes. Coordination across multiple interfaces? Of course. Use of Linux's MMAP_RX_SOCKET and MMAP_TX_SOCKET? Wouldn't have it any other way. Userspace networking is made visible to the host via a TUN/TAP device. While designed as an offensive tool, omphalos has proven useful for network debugging and troubleshooting, as well as experimentation.", "shortname": "omphalos", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "network enumeration and domination", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1172510}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/omphalos/", "video_url": ""}
