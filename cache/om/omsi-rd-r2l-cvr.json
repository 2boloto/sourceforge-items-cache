It includes a spline converter and crossing converter.

Also the converter won't re-create the crossing with correct road surface mark, thus you need to use some other method to fix it. That's it.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that you have .net Framework 2.0 installed before using this app set.", "shortname": "omsi-rd-r2l-cvr", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "RHD to LHD spline & crossing converters for OMSI.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 741995}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/omsi-rd-r2l-cvr/", "video_url": ""}
