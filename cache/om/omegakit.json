Omegakit will support many different languages such as C++. I thought of Omegakit after thinking how useful it would be if notepad++ had a built in compiler and debugger. At the start it will just be a notepad++ like program with a built in compiler and debugger but it will eventually include a API for all supported different languages. It is still in the planning stages so if there are any other features you would like, feel free to suggest them and also feel free to help us out.", "shortname": "omegakit", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Omegakit is a open source IDE for many different programming languages", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 651230}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/omegakit/", "video_url": ""}
