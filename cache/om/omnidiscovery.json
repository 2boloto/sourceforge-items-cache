This is exactly the wrong level of abstraction. A high level API should deliver a connection to the named host and abstract away details like the IP protocol version being used. A low level API should provide access to information stored in SRV and TXT records and support DNSSEC processing.\r\n\r\nOmniDiscovery provides two DNS interfaces, a high level interface that replaces gethostbyname and a low level interface that allows for full access to DNS records.\r\n\r\nThe code implementing the API is created using a code generator which ensures that each language binding produces the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe first language to be supported is C#, C will be added later.", "shortname": "omnidiscovery", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "APIs for DNS and other discovery protocols in C#, C, etc.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1251049}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/omnidiscovery/", "video_url": ""}
