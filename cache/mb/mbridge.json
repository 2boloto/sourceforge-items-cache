We innovatively introduced the hydroxyl-methylated Illumina adapters (all the cytosines in the adapters were hydroxyl-methylated) in MB-seq, brought an easier protocol compared with MeDIP-Bseq. Moreover, a clear superiority of MB-seq is that it can be used to quantify methylation levels at single-base resolution, which was not mentioned by MeDIP-Bseq. MB-seq presented relative methylation levels which are somewhat linearly inflated compared with actual methylation levels. Therefore, we developed MBRidge, a novel ridge regression model-based algorithm that integrates MB-seq and RRBS data to predict DNA methylation levels at single CpG resolution.", "shortname": "mbridge", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Estimating genome-wide single-base methylation level from MB-seq data ", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2318324}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mbridge/", "video_url": null}
