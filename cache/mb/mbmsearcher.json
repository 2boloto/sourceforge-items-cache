With the support from the China Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (COMRRDA12SC01 and COMRRDA12SC02), a chemical database based on secondary metabolite profiles of marine bacteria together with an LC-MS matching software have been developed by Coastal Marine Laboratory (CML) of HKUST. >1000 bacterial strains collected from different marine environment have been successfully cultured and their secondary metabolites were analyzed by LC-MS and imported to database. This database and related software provide a new strategy for natural product screening and a complementary approach to current methods for marine bacteria identification.", "shortname": "mbmsearcher", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Marine bacteria metabolite database", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2081688}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mbmsearcher/", "video_url": null}
