I thought it was very interesting: The Knight can move on any countless number of squares to infinity. This will be true as long as its path remains open. I then set out to devise how to make this work. First to encrypt anything you will need an engine (excipher) then the variables. The engine is represented by the squares and the variables are the input(alphabets) on the squares. \r\n\r\nWhat I need as the vissionary of this project:\r\n\r\n1.Individuals familiar with cryptographic programming with c++ \r\n2.We will like to develop a cryptosystem\r\n3.We will test the protoypes on various architecture and processor speed\r\n4.A data base will be set to hold all solved knights tour solutions\r\n5.We will incorporate these into the encryption system\r\n6.All interested candidates must be naturals and be registered with sourceforge.\r\n7.We will work together in developing the knight's tours templates ", "shortname": "skcjju256", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Encryption system", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 676421}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/skcjju256/", "video_url": ""}
