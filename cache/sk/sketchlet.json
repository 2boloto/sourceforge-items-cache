More specifically, Sketchlet supports: (1) Rapid visualization of software ideas, using graphical editor with interactive support for languages such as Cascading UML, PlantUML, UMLGraph, Graphviz Dot, Pic2Plot, SVG and so on. (2) Rapid exploration and learning about emerging technologies, enabling designers to work with simplified versions of emerging software and hardware technologies, such as Web services, face detectors, sensors, speech input and output, and so on. (3) Rapid prototyping and interactive sketching of application front-ends, using techniques such as screen prototyping, interactive animations, and input and output from simplified input and output software services. (4) Involvement of non-engineers in the software design process, through simplified end-user programming techniques.\r\n", "shortname": "sketchlet", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A software designer's sketchbook", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 636708}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sketchlet/", "video_url": ""}
