This usually includes (but is not restricted to) self-made track work. SketchTrack reads a text file containing the track program and draws it in a 3D space. So, instead of clicking together a track layout in a graphical editor, the user of SketchTrack has to provide a geometrical description of the layout in SketchTrack language.\r\n    \r\nThe advantage of this approach is that real-world track arrangements can be planned, especially ones including curve turnouts with any geometrical configuration. The track layout can potentially be processed beyond visualisation. Further development towards CAD-supported track construction is possible.\r\n", "shortname": "sketchtrack", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Draw railway tracks in 3D from a simple script language in SketchUp", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2447666}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sketchtrack/", "video_url": null}
