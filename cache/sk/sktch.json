SKTCH is a progression of open source CAD/CAE and open source technology building upon FreeCAD and numpy/scipy and HTML5.  \r\n\r\nFreeCAD is a general purpose feature-based, parametric 3D modeler for CAD, MCAD, CAx, CAE and PLM, aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product design but also fits a wider range of uses in engineering, such as architecture or other engineering specialties. \r\n\r\nLike FreeCAD, SKTCH will be 100% Open Source and extremely modular, allowing for very advanced extension and customization. FreeCAD is based on OpenCasCade, a powerful geometry kernel, features an Open Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation model provided by the Coin 3D library, and a broad Python API. \r\n\r\nThe interface will be built to perform the same way on Windows, iOS/Mac, Linux/Android mobile and desktop platforms", "shortname": "sktch", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Collaborative design engineering technology for virtual teams", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1273856}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sktch/", "video_url": ""}
