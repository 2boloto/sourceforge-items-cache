Although Skills-O-Mat was developed for a special training of alginate mixing, it is also capable of training similar motions like cardiac massage. Players use the prepared input devices (spoon and bowl in case of alginate mixing) to start immediate training. No further preparation of the player is required. The game collects motion data in real-time and evaluates the differences between the player and the virtual teacher.", "shortname": "skillsomat", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Serious game to train periodic rhythmic motions.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 670930}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/skillsomat/", "video_url": ""}
