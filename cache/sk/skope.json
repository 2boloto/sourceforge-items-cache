Not just a keylogger, Skope is literally a \"Skope\" into your computer's usage. During the Skope setup, you are prompted to type in keywords. These words will trigger Skope to make a \"SkopeShot\" of the screen. A SkopeShot is a packaged number of images that were taken from the screen at a specified delay interval. These are designed to give you a rough idea of your child or other computer user's online activities. Additionally, the Keylog section displays recordings of keystrokes on the computer and how they correlate with the SkopeShots that were taken.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE!**\r\nVersion 1.6 is out.", "shortname": "skope", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Monitor Activity on your Computer by Auto Screenshot Capture", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1043551}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/skope/", "video_url": null}
