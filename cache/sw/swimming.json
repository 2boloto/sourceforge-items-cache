Some children will be anxious and nervous, while others will take to the water right away. Ease them into it, and allow them to progress at their own rate. To teach your child to trust the water, have them sit on the side of the pool with their feet dangling in the water. Have he or she fall into your arms and cheer excitedly. Do this over and over until the child feels confident enough to jump into the water. Use a life vest for your child if they are anxious.\r\n2 \r\nGet their faces wet and blow bubbles. Blow air into your children's faces then slowly dip your face into the water while you are blowing out air. This will cause you to blow bubbles, and your children can associate it with your blowing air. Allow them to imitate you and blow their own bubbles.\r\nSponsored Links\r\nTemplate Download \r\nOver 1500 Business & Legal MS Word Document Templates, Download Today!\r\nDocument-Templates.Biztree.com 3 \r\nTeach them to hold their breath.
