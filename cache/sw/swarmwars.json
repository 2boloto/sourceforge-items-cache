The organisms can communicate through 3-color signaling as well as by laying beacons.  They can attack and repair other organisms.  They can select mates, and they can gather and distribute food and material.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is controlled by  a genetically evolved neural net augmented with online back propagation learning.  The back propagation learning uses a reward vector and plasticity matrix that is evolved as part of the genome.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the AI is pretty frickin' sophisticated.  \r\n\r\nPlayers can take control of organisms, trade resources and organisms in a market, and aid evolution by selective breeding.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "swarmwars", "_id": "4ef61bac0594ca7e9b000574", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 654474, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Safety in numbers.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "id": 80}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "id": 133}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence :: Machine Learning", "shortname": "machinelearning", "fullname": "Machine Learning", "id": 802}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other Audience", "id": 5}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
