The idea is to enable users to make GUI as if they are using paint application to draw a design and later generating the code for it. The project also includes a built in Code Editor for editing Java applications. The code editor can also be used to edit file of any supported text file format. \r\nThe work is focused on the layout of the components that gives the interface a clear and consistent look, conforming to specifiable interface guidelines, in an application and across applications. This interface builder provides an environment for specifying component and layout specifications for the interface of Java applets and applications. The tool enables anyone who knows the semantics of the Java Abstract Windowing Toolkit (java.awt) to build quality interfaces. This is achieved by integrating general design principles", "shortname": "swingartist", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Mini Java IDE and Swing builder", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1977085}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/swingartist/", "video_url": ""}
