Applications are built using few basic operators that compose single RDF graphs or datasets to create new graphs or datasets. RDF graphs can be both of static and dynamic content. The language provides functional operators (graph union and SPARQL Construct) as well as a stateful one (a \"SPARQL updatable\" graph).\r\nThe implementation is Java based and allows to build event-based applications for different kind of interface devices.
