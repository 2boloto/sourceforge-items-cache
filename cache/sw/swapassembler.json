We present SWAP-Assembler, a scalable and fully parallelized genome assembler designed for massive sequencing data. Intend of using traditional de Bruijn Graph, SWAP-Assembler adopts multi-step bi-directed graph (MSG). With MSG, the standard genome assembly (SGA) is equivalent to the edge merging operations in a semi-group. Then a computation model, SWAP, is designed to parallelize semi-group computation. Experimental results showed that SWAP-Assembler is the fastest and most efficient assemblers ever, it can generated contigs with highest accuracy over all five selected assemblers and longest contig N50 in all selected parallel assemblers. Specially, in the scalability test, SWAP-Assembler can scales up to 1024 cores when processing Fish and Yanhuang dataset, and finishes the assembly work in only 15 and 29 minutes respecitively", "shortname": "swapassembler", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A scalable and fully parallelized genome assembler", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1988076}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/swapassembler/", "video_url": ""}
