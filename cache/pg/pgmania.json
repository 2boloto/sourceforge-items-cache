It helps to recover continious numbers in images sequence after they were deleted, renamed or moved. PGMania can help to filter the source images and to build the movie from it. Also it is possible to build one movie from several parts by concatenating them. By default the destination of PGMania is operate with 16bpp gray image format .pgm (netpbm). But she works well with many of known 8-16 bpp images formats too.\r\nPGMania shows the image preview or frame of movie by fitting it in window, in original size or zooming up to 3x. She allows to navigate over list of frames, to filter images by template and to delete the bad ones. When the files list been formed she constructs image sequence based on selected file type and name template. \r\nAs default PGMania builds 16bpp or 8bpp gray movie and use ffv1 lossless codec. PGMania can create the raw video from images as alternate to Avi.
