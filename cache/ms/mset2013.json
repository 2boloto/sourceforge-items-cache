It also works in OS X, but requires the installation of the XQuartz architecture (https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki) to enable tcltk.  This added complexity can lead to technical difficulties.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: An MSET script (\"mset_text.R\") is now included in the MSET folder which allows users to manually designate input files via a text prompt.  This bypasses the need for tcl/tk on OS X, although it is not as fast or easy to use.  File names must be entered in quotations, including the .txt extension, and are case sensitive.", "shortname": "mset2013", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@zeuroscience", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A randomization testing script for genetic enrichment analysis", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1994586}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mset2013/", "video_url": null}
