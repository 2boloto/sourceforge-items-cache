The tool chain is based on the MSP430-FET430UIF Jtag programming hardware and the TI(TM) open source driver which is needed to access the UIF on the PC side.\r\n\r\nBeside the hardware tool chain, there is a second part which provides a virtual tool chain. The open source driver is patched and a new data channel is added, which redirects the USB output to a socket interface. The virtual tool chain itself consists of an implementation of the PC <> UIF transfer protocol and a public interface for a simulated target.\r\n\r\nThe screen shot demonstrates a simulated MSP430F5438A target on CCS (linux). As long as the CCS instance is not aware that there is no real hardware attached, it's a good test option for external simulators.\r\n", "shortname": "msp4linux", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "C++ based debug interface to MSP430,  MSP-FET430UIF needed", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 571542}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/msp4linux/", "video_url": ""}
