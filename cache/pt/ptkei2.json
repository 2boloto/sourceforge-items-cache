Ptkei (the client's nickname) provides a powerful graphics based interface to what would otherwise be a purely terminal based game.\r\n\r\nThis client functions solely as a client. In order to use this program effectively one must be familiar with Empire.\r\n\r\nPython is a very high-level interpretive programming language. Ptkei uses this language (and its interface to Tcl/Tk) to provide a flexible, portable, and fast interface.\r\n\r\nThanks to the developers, contributors and maintainers of PTkEI.\r\n\r\nPtkei 1.18.1 was released on September 07, 2003. I have updated the client so it is compatible with the 4.3.XX Empire Server. \r\n\r\nPTkEI 2.00.0 is now available! So far, works with Windows7 & Linux with Python 2.7.X. Read the documentation for full details. Includes tool for the visually impaired.
