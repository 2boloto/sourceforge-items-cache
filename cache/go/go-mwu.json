Instead, it uses a rank-based test to measure how much each GO category is enriched with either up or down-regulated genes. The significant GO categories are clustered based on the number of genes shared between them and the results are represented in the form of a colored dendrogram (see screenshot).", "shortname": "go-mwu", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN MOVED TO GITHUB", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2343228}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/go-mwu/", "video_url": null}
