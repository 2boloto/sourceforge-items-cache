Instead, it uses a rank-based test to measure how much each GO category is enriched with either up or down-regulated genes. The significant GO categories are clustered based on the number of genes shared between them and the results are represented in the form of a colored dendrogram (see screenshot).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "go-mwu", "_id": "543c451ea02bb173e6994af3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2343228, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN MOVED TO GITHUB", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
