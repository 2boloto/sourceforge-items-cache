During the game you get cards, which\r\nhave next values:\r\n\r\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - according to numbers in it's names;\r\nJ - 2 points;\r\nQ - 3 points;\r\nK - 4 points;\r\nA - 11 points.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the game you get 2 cards, and if your total points are less\r\nthan 21, you can take more cards or keep your current cards. Then is your opponent's\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nIf player got 21 - this is called \"Golden Point\".\r\nIf player got more than 21 - this is too much, he has lost. So if Player 1 has\r\ntoo much, and Player 2 isn't - Player 2 wins.\r\nIf both players have not more points, than 21, player, who has more points, wins.\r\nIf both players have equal points - this is dead heat.
