The\r\nmain goal of the game is to get more points then your opponent, but in the same\r\ntime not to get more than 21 (\"Golden Point\"). During the game you get cards, which\r\nhave next values:\r\n\r\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - according to numbers in it's names;\r\nJ - 2 points;\r\nQ - 3 points;\r\nK - 4 points;\r\nA - 11 points.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the game you get 2 cards, and if your total points are less\r\nthan 21, you can take more cards or keep your current cards. Then is your opponent's\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nIf player got 21 - this is called \"Golden Point\".\r\nIf player got more than 21 - this is too much, he has lost. So if Player 1 has\r\ntoo much, and Player 2 isn't - Player 2 wins.\r\nIf both players have not more points, than 21, player, who has more points, wins.\r\nIf both players have equal points - this is dead heat.
