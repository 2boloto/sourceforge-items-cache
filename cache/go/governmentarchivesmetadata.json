ANDS is supported by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy Program and the Education Investment Fund (EIF) Super Science Initiative.\r\n\r\nGovernment Archives across Australia hold massive collections of material of great value however discovering relevant material is currently challenging for researchers. The project has developed software and processes to assist archives in preparing metadata for harvesting by Research Data Australia. \r\n\r\nThe project developed SQL stored procedures, PHP scripts, and documents detailing the installation, operation, and customisation of the solution. These are intended to allow other archives to easily implement automated harvesting of archival metadata.  The solution supports OAI-PMH harvesting in RIF-CS formatted XML.
