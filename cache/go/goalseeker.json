Using this framework will allow developers to focus on a specific domain of interest, while leaving many of the AI concepts and goal-searching concepts to be implemented by the framework\r\n\r\nThe front-end classes use Swing and thus can be run via the Web.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask questions or to send feedback.", "shortname": "goalseeker", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Fifteen puzzle, with its own goal-seeking to find the best solution", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 69112}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Feature Requests", "mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "cvs"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/goalseeker/", "video_url": ""}
