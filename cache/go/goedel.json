As the name suggests it is written in itself.\r\n\r\nThe original version of Goedel was written in C and made use of a yacc parser. This version has been entirely re-written in C# and does not require yacc.. Although conversion to Java or C would be quite simple.\r\n\r\nOver 30 code synthesizers have been developed in Goedel, mostly for very narrow subject domains. I will be posting some of the ones that appear to be more generally useful in due course as separate projects.\r\n\r\nThe basic observation that led to the development of Goedel is that most programming tasks tend to get to a repetitious 'template filling' mode after a while. This is especially true of network protocol code, of GUI design and of code for parsers and lexical analyzers.\r\n\r\nSince I write a lot of protocol specifications, knowing that the code, examples and text suites are in sync is very important to me. Godel allows me to automate this.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "goedel", "_id": "4fd5746db9363c0e9f000089", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 791468, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Goedel is a code synthesizer for building code synthesizers.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
