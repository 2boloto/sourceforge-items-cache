Its function is similar to random password generators, but the generation method is very different. This program generates passwords based on opening moves in a go game.\r\n\r\nThe method is simple: the Custom Seed at the bottom is used to seed a random number generator (RNG). The RNG assigns a value to every intersection on the board. After moves are played, and Make Password pressed, the values of the intersections generate a password based on the game. All of this is done locally. No information is sent outside of the program.\r\n\r\nBecause go players can remember game moves so well (the information is meaningful), it allows them to use unique passwords for different websites without having to memorize strange strings of symbols (which are meaningless).\r\n\r\nHow strong are the passwords? The complexity is 361 * 360 * 359 ... n times where \"n\" is the number of moves. So after 8 or so moves, they are pretty strong. And when put with the seed, it is very strong.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gopass", "_id": "54f2887f04161f598e744a40", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2417979, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "GoPass uses moves in a game of go to generate a password.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "shortname": "security", "fullname": "Security", "id": 43}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": []}}
