The OASIS Programming Language is a 4GL Concurrency- and Database Language running round a distributed OASIS Runtime Machine Environment (RME) as interpreted OASIS Scripts sequenced into OASIS Polyglot Runtime Components (PRC) with just in time patterns. The IDE is designed specifically for the OASIS Programming Language. The IDE is focused around the concept of Visual-, Online-, Data-Centric-, Concurrent-, and Runtime- Code, whilst remaining an IDE to handle OASIS Programming. The IDE has a number of visual code drag and drop features. The Tool is by no means a representative of the Cyclical UML Model- and Code concept, but rather a replacement. The IDE Tool is focused around (Team Based) System Engineering, Meta Programming, Visual Coding, Concurrent Processing and, Databases and Big Data.", "shortname": "godevtool", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "OASIS Development Tool", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2387853}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/godevtool/", "video_url": null}
