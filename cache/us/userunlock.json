If several users share a workstation, then from an audit / security standpoint, they should each have unique usernames. From a security standpoint, idle workstations should lock the screen. But when a windows computer is locked, only the logged in user can unlock it. Many admins circumvent this issue by creating a generic shared username for the shared workstation; to which the users know the passwords but the public does not. This creates an auditing nightmare. Ideally, any user should be able to kick the last user off if needed (but not unlock their session, else they could impersonate them). This software allows just that -- and works with windows 2k - windows 8 64 bit or 32 bit.", "shortname": "userunlock", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Allows standard users to unlock a locked windows workstation!", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1803667}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/userunlock/", "video_url": ""}
