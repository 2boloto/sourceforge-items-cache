The harness consists of a set of web service interfaces and corresponding database tracking/reporting.  \r\n\r\nThe main goals of the test harness are to:\r\n\u2022 Lower costs of adopting the CIM by making information easily available in a self-service application to validate and generate messages providing vendor feedback and self-diagnosis;\r\n\u2022 Provide a future framework for additional certification; and\r\n\u2022 Provide an extensible framework for additional web service/standards.\r\n\r\nThe test harness is designed to work in a cloud environment, in which low-cost instances can be created for each vendor, as needed.  Given this affordability, vendors can be assigned multiple roles such as CIS, MDMS, AMI head end, or OMS.  In addition to the actual web services, the test harness also includes a web UI for reporting of success/failure of each in", "shortname": "usstestharness", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 722336}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/usstestharness/", "video_url": ""}
