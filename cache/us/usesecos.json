Downloaded files (and any other files entering the system) will be subjected to both an exception-based and signature-based virus scan. After that, they will be placed in a leveled security storage space, each more secure--with the most secure being 50. Under 50 will be 46-49; under that is 36-45; under that is 27-25; under that is 26; under that is 14-25; under that is 6-13; under that is 5-3; lastly there is level 2 the most insecure.
