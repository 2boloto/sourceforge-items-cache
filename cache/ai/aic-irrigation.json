As the product matures and features are added it is expected to be a fully functional controller used in large scale implementations, green houses and glass houses.  AIC platform's in-dependency means it can run on both Linux or Windows XP onwards .\r\n\r\nA large range of serial boards (as well as usb boards that present as serial devices) are able to be controlled.  KMTronic's USB and Serial relay boards are selectable in the configuration menu, other boards can be setup by entering their control commands.\r\n\r\nAlthough primarily designed for irrigation you can use AIC to control a large variety of hardware, for example lighting, heating etc\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that future implementations of AIC will incorporate rules for more complex device control.", "summary": "Automated Irrigation Controller for computers", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 774765, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aic-irrigation", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/markkendall/", "username": "markkendall", "name": "Mark Kendall"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/AIC-MainWindow.png", "caption": "Main WIndow", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/AIC-MainWindow.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/AIC-SelectDevice.png", "caption": "Select a device", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/AIC-SelectDevice.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/AIC-ConfigureSerialDevice.png", "caption": "Configure a serial device", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/AIC-ConfigureSerialDevice.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/CustomSerialInterfaceConfig.png", "caption": "Configure serial component of user configured device", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/CustomSerialInterfaceConfig.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/CustomSerialCommandConfig.png", "caption": "Configure commands for user configurable device", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aic-irrigation/screenshot/CustomSerialCommandConfig.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 -
