Clinical Analytics is a tool for creating research databases containing electronic health record and other data in support of cohort discovery and analysis.\r\n\r\nEureka! populates an i2b2 (http://www.i2b2.org) database with your data, either imported from a spreadsheet or located in a data warehouse at your healthcare institution. It also populates the database with cohort descriptions of your patients, called clinical phenotypes, that you specify as temporal patterns in diagnoses, procedures, lab test results and other clinical and administrative data. While researchers today typically perform chart abstraction to assign patients to cohorts, Eureka! does it automatically. I2b2 lets you extract data and computed phenotypes about selected patients into standard statistical analysis tools.", "summary": "Easy creation of clinical databases for cohort discovery and analysis", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 760123, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aiw", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/aiw/", "username": "aiw", "name": "aiw"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aiw/screenshot/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-29%20at%206.00.52%20PM.png", "caption": "Eureka!
