WHYDAH provides users with easy access to a comprehensive and large collection of security-related tools. Support for live USB functionality allows users to boot directly from portable media without requiring installation, though permanent installation to hard disk is also an option.  With WHYDAH you can easily grasp the concepts and understand the techniques to perform wireless attacks in your own lab.  Get started with wireless testing, security and hacking with basic wireless concepts.\r\n  \r\nWHYDAH has participated in development of so called sqlzma patches; the code implements 7-zip compression (LZMA) into squashfs filesystem. Moreover, squashfs evolved by the time and it now supports bigger block sizes than before.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "airteam", "_id": "5110ed5cb9363c5afd94265f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Manual"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1270718, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Penetration Testing and Security Auditing Linux Distribution", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
