Commands are stored in a seperate config file (default is ~/.ergo-favrc). This is so that changes are reflected by openbox immediately, without needing to restart. Openbox WILL need to be restarted after the initial install though.\r\n\r\nThere a number of commands added by default. These use generic programs where possible, for example \"x-www-browser\" is used by default for the \"Web/Home\" button. Other defaults rely on commonly used programs that may need to be changed to reflect the users settings, for example: catfish is used for the \"Search\" button by default and \"amixer\" for the audio controls.\r\n\r\nI am unable to find a way to register events for the \"Zoom\" joystick, so this is not available.
