X-SOCS aims at retrieving strain and tilt maps of nanostructures, films, surfaces or even embedded structures. It offers the opportunity to get preliminary results directly at the beamline giving the user the opportunity to adapt the planning of the experiments and the measurements with respect to this first set of results. This is of particular importance for the application of such fast scanning methods to in operando studies at high temperatures or in gas or liquid environments.
