Each XSIT distribution contains the file 'schema.xsd' that is the reference XML Schema.\r\nThe resource browsing is guaranteed by a class or a function (it depends on the programming language) that parses (doesn't validate!) and loads in memory the resources contained in a valid xml file or string.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xsit", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kryptika/", "username": "kryptika", "name": "Kryptika"}], "external_homepage": "http://xsit.sourceforge.net"}
