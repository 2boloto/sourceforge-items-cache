That means you can use Ctalk for GUI, network, client-server, and systems programs as well as traditional object oriented simulations.  Ctalk includes a just-in-time compiler, extendable class libraries, and a compact run-time library.  Written for use with GNU GCC, Ctalk supports a variety of UNIX and Linux systems, the X Window System, and libraries like the GNU readline library.  \r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about Ctalk, you can download the tutorial as a  PDF file on the Downloads page.
