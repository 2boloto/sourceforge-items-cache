This is quite instructive as software, expecially if taken in conjuction with the pure X Window System version: in both cases the 3D frames representing what happens are done internally by the program, using basic concepts form 3D computational graphics. Stanrd C as all the optehr memeberso of the series. \r\n\r\nit come in 2 subversions: Linux and Windows. for the Windows version there is a ready executable too.
