CTQA is a software package to aid in quality assurance of image quality for CT scanners. The software currently only supports analysis of CT-images of the CatPhan600? phantom. Other phantoms may be supported upon request.\r\nThe purpose of CTQA-cp is twofold: 1) To handle and analyze image sets consisting of a few thousand images that is commonly obtained from image quality assurance protocols on CT scanners. 2) Easily provide results that can be copied to your favorite word or spreadsheet processor, or be saved to disk.
