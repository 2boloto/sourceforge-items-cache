Predecessor of the CTruck3D vehicle simulator series. I wrote it from zero in C (+OpenGL&GLUT). It has ascii-art and nice graphics version, and a special funny version\r\n\r\nIt's a very basic thing: there are free rigid bodies and springs with strong attenuation/damping. It's very simple and very short code, and collisions of bodies with ground are good and stable. \r\n\r\nA good simulation of this kind, however requires Lagrangian method. I proposed the Lagrange_motocross as an alternative of this kind. The code is not much longer but the it's overall more complicated, and collisions are a bad issue.
