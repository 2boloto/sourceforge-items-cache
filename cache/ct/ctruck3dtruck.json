Written in the C programming language: although the code is 30 pages long, it's simple. Trailer can be detouched pressming 'l' (minuscle ELL) so to drive a normal car.  There's an OpenGL version too: see the CTruck3D _Open,and an ASCII-Art ver (Term_ CTruck3D). This is also a good dydactical software: code is easy to undersand,and drawing procedures and physics sim procedure are written from 0 so it's clearly understandable how a complete 3D game is done in C, starting from a blank page of any plain text editor.Only basic knowledge of C was used.
