They provide reusable methods and code skeletons to simplify development, but their extensive character represents a not neglectable overhead in their familiarization period. This is also true if one want to use only specific parts of the framework. CTK is a lightweight open-source toolkit for the biomedical field that offers a service-based plugin-framework. The design of the CTK framework enables the creation of modular CAS applications. So far, there have been only a few comprehensive tutorials of the CTK toolkit on the internet. We introduce a demo application that can be used as a template for standard navigation. In this demo, the CTK plugin framework, a central part of the common toolkit, is discussed and explained in detail. This reduces the familiarization period for CAS application development. In addition, created plugins/modules can be reused easily.", "summary": "The Common Toolkit in Computer-Assisted Surgery - A Tutorial", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2013286, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ctkcas", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/fganglberger/", "username": "fganglberger", "name": "fganglberger"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/yusufoezbek/", "username": "yusufoezbek", "name": "Yusuf \u00d6zbek"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/screenshot1.png", "caption": "DICOM Plugin", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/screenshot1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/Screenshot6.png", "caption": "Navigation Plugin 3", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/Screenshot6.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/Screenshot8.png", "caption": "Microscope Plugin 1", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/Screenshot8.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/screenshot2.png", "caption": "Navigation Plugin 1", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/screenshot2.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/Screenshot4.png", "caption": "Navigation Plugin 2", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/Screenshot4.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/Screenshot7.png", "caption": "Microscope Plugin 2", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ctkcas/screenshot/Screenshot7.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.voxelmaster.at", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
