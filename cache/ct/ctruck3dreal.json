This is subsancially kept as hystorical. The environment is a hilly terrain which can also be user-defined in the form of a Bitmap image file (where intensity of red component defines height). It's similar to the classic \"Terep 2\". Particular care for internal cam. Written in standard C. There's a Windows executable ready for use, but it's compilable and playable on all Linux, BSD, MacOSX systems.
