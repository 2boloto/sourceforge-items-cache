This includes the ability to construct and simulate block diagrams. The visual block diagram interface offers a simple method for constructing, modifying and maintaining complex system models. The simulation engine provides fast and accurate solutions for linear, nonlinear, continuous time, discrete time, time varying and hybrid system designs. With JMCAD, users can quickly develop software or \"virtual\" prototypes of systems or processes to demonstrate their behavior prior to building physical prototypes.\r\n\r\nThe user builds his system model by selecting predefined blocks from a block library and simply wiring the blocks together. Each block of the diagram performs a function. Users can also create custom blocks in Java and add them to the JMCAD block library.\r\n\r\nJMCAD is a block diagram language for creating complex nonlinear dynamic systems.", "shortname": "jmcad", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 216987}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jmcad/", "video_url": ""}
