Originally designed to target Digital Terrain Model analysis tasks it can also be applied to any other 2D physical scalar field. Data can be easily imported from CSV-like file (local or online). Most common interpolation methods are available, including multiple versions of Kriging along with variographic models. Besides, developer is provided with a large set of raster map predefinite processing tools. Transformation interfaces are specifically designed to enable performing complex and customized operations on map grid, meanwhile saving developer from writing any loop instruction or feeling concerned about edge problems. Moreover, JMuria contains a basic gui object, useful to check that tasks have been performed as expected. Output maps can be exported in multiple formats. Source code is provided with Example-Test class (running about 80 % of the total number of instructions).", "shortname": "jmuria", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Java Raster Map Processing Library", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2207302}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jmuria/", "video_url": null}
