It has the ability to set and change album art as well as load devices with exactly the number and size of files to fit in a known file system size. Like for devices. It is up and working and what I feel is intuitive but it could use some sprucing up with nice graphics and maybe more functions. My goal here was to start something and see it grow. And most importantly pay it forward for all the open source that I have benefited from.\r\n\r\nIt makes use of some other open source libraries like JAudioTagger and JAudioLayer.
