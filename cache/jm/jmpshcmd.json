If you want to use only one user interface for all devices you will not find the \"right\" tool. But there are different automation plattforms like homematic or openhab and often a scripting feature are available. \r\n\r\nThe main idea behind jmpshcmd is a java based tool with support for missing features (like udpsend) or a simple way to integrate an automation standard (like homematic). \r\n\r\nThis tool can used to start a command from a scripting exit. For testing issues a console mode is available. If you implement an own java based integration you can use the jmpshcmd features via Java based api.\r\n\r\nPlanned integration for:\r\n- Homematic\r\n- (Fritzbox)\r\n- (openhab)\r\n- (Intrexx)\r\n- ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tool was made for a private project (ccu2, raspi, android).
