MSDB can accept large number of sequences in GenBank, FASTA and EMBL formats as input and large number of motifs can be searched simultaneously. The program not only can search pure microsatellite but also can search compound and complex microsatellite. The outputs are Microsoft Excel statistics and SQLite database file which is convenient for analysis and classification of microsatellites. The program is designed to run on Windows and Linux system as a standalone application with a user-friendly interface.", "shortname": "m-dna", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Microsatellite Search and Building Database", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 507060}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/m-dna/", "video_url": ""}
