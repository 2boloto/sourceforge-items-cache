MUMPS can solve system of equations in parallel. To use this feature, environment variable HOST_NUM_FOR_MUMPS was introduced.\r\n\r\nAll MPI-hosts are divided into groups of size HOST_NUM_FOR_MUMPS each. Hosts of one group perform parallel calculation for common energy value on common system of linear equations. Default value of HOST_NUM_FOR_MUMPS is 1.
