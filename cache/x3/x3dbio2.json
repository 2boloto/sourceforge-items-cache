X3DBio2 is a visual analysis tool for 3D biomolecular structure comparison that allows for a clear comparison between similar structures from various species, for elucidation of structural effects of mutations, and for assessment of snapshots from molecular dynamics trajectories. X3DBio2 is the second milestone in a larger project currently in progress. The first milestone, X3DBio1 tool, focuses on single molecular structure visual exploration and analysis. In contrast, X3DBio2 focuses on multiple structure comparison and assessment of snapshots from MD trajectories. Both tools can be used separately or complementing each other. We expect both tools can be applied to solve a variety of biological problems.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "x3dbio2", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/x3dbio/", "username": "x3dbio", "name": "Hong Yi"}], "external_homepage": ""}
