It's actually pretty simple. \r\n\r\nThe guesser is given an upper bound between 3 and 15 times the guessed number. From there the chooser tells the guesser whether the number they guessed is higher or lower than the number. \r\n\r\nIt's a pretty simple thing really, but fun to mess around with sometimes.
