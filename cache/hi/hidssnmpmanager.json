You notice a problem with your network, and though you have lots of management tools running, querying ports and visualizing data, but either just that exact port you need hasn't been added to your NMS, or the data stored does not cover the detail you need, or has been compressed to compensate for outrageous space requirements ...\r\nHIDS SNMP Manager attempts to solve this problem for you. Any device's ports added to it will be logged, without averages to save space, while at the same time keeping relevant details for indefinite time at low requirements on space (e.g. keeping in/out/error counters of a router interface, at 1min intervals, for a whole month only comes in at ~130k)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hidssnmpmanager", "_id": "5149b7ebd46bb4201a8ea3a3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1397910, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Efficiently query and store SNMP performance data", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving", "shortname": "archiving", "fullname": "Archiving", "id": 19}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking :: Monitoring", "shortname": "monitoring", "fullname": "Monitoring", "id": 152}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "shortname": "php", "fullname": "PHP", "id": 183}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
