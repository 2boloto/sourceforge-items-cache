If so, you probably wanted to do some crazy stuff on the other keyboard like shortcuts. Yeah, there is HIDmacro. It does its job well. Sometimes. It just fails on some applications or keys. And its not that powerful.\r\n\r\nHIDintercept is somewhat different. Because it uses a driver [http://oblita.com/interception.html] it is able to reliable detect, block and process keystrokes from different keyboards. You can activate triggers based on started programs and which program you are currently working at. And it won't leak the original key strokes, like HIDmacro did on apps using DXInput.\r\n\r\nWith plugins extendable, so just write your own trigger or condition or fancy HUD.\r\n\r\nOh, and don't forget to read the manual. May help a little bit.\r\n\r\nAccording to a review, you'll need VC 2013 runtime installed.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hidintercept", "_id": "53dbe9dbd46bb472a1c3bff7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2295018, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Remap multiple Keyboards powerfull and easy.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business", "shortname": "office", "fullname": "Office/Business", "id": 129}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Hardware", "shortname": "hardware", "fullname": "Hardware", "id": 146}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0", "shortname": "ccanclv2", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0", "id": 871}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Windows Aero", "shortname": "winaero", "fullname": "Windows Aero", "id": 763}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
