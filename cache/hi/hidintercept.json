If so, you probably wanted to do some crazy stuff on the other keyboard like shortcuts. Yeah, there is HIDmacro. It does its job well. Sometimes. It just fails on some applications or keys.

Because it uses a driver [http://oblita.com/interception.html] it is able to reliable detect, block and process keystrokes from different keyboards. You can activate triggers based on started programs and which program you are currently working at. And it won't leak the original key strokes, like HIDmacro did on apps using DXInput.\r\n\r\nWith plugins extendable, so just write your own trigger or condition or fancy HUD.\r\n\r\nOh, and don't forget to read the manual. May help a little bit.\r\n\r\nAccording to a review, you'll need VC 2013 runtime installed.", "shortname": "hidintercept", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Remap multiple Keyboards powerfull and easy.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2295018}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/hidintercept/", "video_url": null}
