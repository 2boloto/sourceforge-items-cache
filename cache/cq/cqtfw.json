The transform CQT(Constant Q Transform) provide analisys frequencies in a exponencial way, like music does, but it have problems with the time resolution. In CQT-FW we have the same frequency resolution as CQT, but with fixed length windows in time, what leads to a constant time resolution as well. And more, time and frequency resolution are not dependent like in CQT end DFT transforms. We also propose a post processing witch eliminate the high order harmonics, leaving only the fundamental frequencies. The transform got good results in a good range of frequencies, but still have problems in low frequencies.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cqtfw", "_id": "4f92281bb9363c661a000028", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 753423, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "CQT-FW is an audio analisys tool for multiple pitch recognition", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Analysis", "shortname": "analysis", "fullname": "Analysis", "id": 114}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
