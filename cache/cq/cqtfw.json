The transform CQT(Constant Q Transform) provide analisys frequencies in a exponencial way, like music does, but it have problems with the time resolution. In CQT-FW we have the same frequency resolution as CQT, but with fixed length windows in time, what leads to a constant time resolution as well. And more, time and frequency resolution are not dependent like in CQT end DFT transforms. We also propose a post processing witch eliminate the high order harmonics, leaving only the fundamental frequencies. The transform got good results in a good range of frequencies, but still have problems in low frequencies.", "shortname": "cqtfw", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "CQT-FW is an audio analisys tool for multiple pitch recognition", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 753423}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cqtfw/", "video_url": ""}
