The game view has also been used in the specification and verification of the interaction between components, and of the interaction between components and their environment. Furthermore, the game model can also give the multi-valued semantics of monitors which can provide enough information to help the system to take measures for failure prevention and recovery.", "shortname": "psc2gs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "PSC2GM is proposed on automatic generation of game-based monitors", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/psc2gs/", "video_url": ""}
