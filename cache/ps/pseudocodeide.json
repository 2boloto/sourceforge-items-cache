But none of these SDKs comes with an IDE. Furthermore, new versions of the targeted platforms and firmware are created on a 1 or 2 years basis.\r\n\r\nSo, new technologies are integrated in these platforms, then in the hosted applications. But 95% of the applications structure remain the same. This common structure can be described in a kind of pseudo-code terms (i.e. in an xml file).\r\n\r\nThe idea is not to create a huge super-compatible UML IDE, but a simple and friendly adaptative IDE to help coders develop then compile lite games and apps when they are targetting different platforms like iPhone, Wii or Android.", "shortname": "pseudocodeide", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "IDE - UI for everything", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 698779}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pseudocodeide/", "video_url": ""}
