I have read of several people who say they have found a way to decrypt and the reincrypt the save game file but I havent seen anyone make something to do it for you. I know I can't do any of this. So I'm looking for people who can help. I want to make a stand alone program that can load, edit, and save the PS3 save games for people. Now there are others that say well just find a way to decrypt it then load in on the PC version of the game, modify with the console then erincrypt and copy back to PS3. Well that is fine. But not everyone has both versions of the game. So if you think you can help let me know. I'll start as soon as I can on the base programs look and functions to the best of my ablilities. I hope to hear from egger people to help soon! Oh and I have yet to think of a name for it so I'm taking suggestions there as well....", "shortname": "ps3skyrimeditor", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "I want to make a PS3 save game editor.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 728412}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ps3skyrimeditor/", "video_url": ""}
