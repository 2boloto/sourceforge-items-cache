In program analysis and testing, open-source and commercial programs are routinely used as benchmarks to evaluate different aspects of the algorithms and tools. Unfortunately, many of these programs are written by programmers who introduce different biases, not to mention that it is very difficult to find programs that can serve as benchmarks with high reproducibility of results.\r\n\r\nWe propose a novel approach for generating random benchmarks for evaluating program analysis and testing tools. Our approach uses stochastic parse trees, where language grammar production rules are assigned probabilities that specify the frequencies with which instantiations of these rules will appear in the generated programs. We implemented our tool for Java and applied it to generate benchmarks with which we evaluated different program analysis and testing tools.
