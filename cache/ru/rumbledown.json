The hope is also to break up non-open fluxes to enable a truly single-point access.\r\n\r\nDon not forget: in the future some sort of encryption will be called upon to protect user data and privacy. At that time we will have to address the necessary controls issues.\r\nFor the start up that will not be a problem.
