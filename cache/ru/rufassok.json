It uses puzzle data in a text format that is easily found in collections on the internet, although often requiring a bit of editting.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this implementation is that it is fully OpenGL 3.3 core profile C++ code, using no OpenGL-deprecated functions.\r\n\r\nHas undo (u) and restart (r) functions.  Each data file has many \"levels\".  The next (n) and previous (p) keys move between levels.  The (R-shft) and (L-shft) keys move between puzzle data files.  Bigger (b) and smaller (s) keys help you to proportionally adjust the size of the window.  ReZero (z) creates a setpoint so that (r) will later restore that setpoint.\r\n\r\nTo move the blue \"pusher\" use the arrow keys.  The objective is to push all the red squares onto the green squares.\r\n\r\nComes with dozens of families of puzzles, each family having dozens of levels.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rufassok", "_id": "53bf340ed46bb4586c0d3400", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2279023, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Sokoban with many families of puzzles provided.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games", "shortname": "Puzzles", "fullname": "Puzzle Games", "id": 268}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: SDL", "shortname": "ui_sdl", "fullname": "SDL", "id": 480}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}]}}
