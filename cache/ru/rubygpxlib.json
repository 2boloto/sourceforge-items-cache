Available software from Garmin (TM)(R) and also available OpenSource software sum-up all vertical deltas which due to the fractal nature of this problems results in way to high altitude differences calculated. This library tries to avoid this by filtering on crucial extrema (minimums, maximums) within a certain observation window. \r\n\r\n", "shortname": "rubygpxlib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Ruby GPX Library, a library to handle GPX data", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2244609}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rubygpxlib/", "video_url": null}
