The source files are included for the installer and all packages are easily updateable. Installer written in  visual basic. The settings are optimized for Intel hd graphics 3000 on intel i5 processor. All of the settings can be tweaked to your own needs with the codectweakertool which is also included. \r\nThis installer is opensource and can be upgraded for better useability. The idea behind this is to install and enjoy! Why download a codec pack and tweak all the settings out for hours upon hours when I did all the work already.\r\nNOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED!!
