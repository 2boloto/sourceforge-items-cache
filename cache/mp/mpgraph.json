The API is based on the Gather-Apply-Scatter (GAS) model as used in GraphLab. To deliver high performance computation and efficiently utilize the high memory bandwidth of GPUs, MapGraph's CUDA kernels use multiple strategies, such as vertex-degree-dependent dynamic parallelism granularity and frontier compaction.\r\n\r\n- MapGraph is up to two orders of magnitude faster than parallel CPU implementations on up 24 CPU cores and has performance comparable to a state-of-the-art manually optimized GPU implementation.\r\n\r\n- New algorithms can be implemented in a few hours that fully exploit the data-level parallelism of the GPU and offer throughput of up to 3.3B traversed edges per second on a single GPU.\r\n\r\nThis work was (partially) funded by the DARPA XDATA program under AFRL Contract #FA8750-13-C-0002 and DARPA Contract #D14PC00029.\r\n", "shortname": "mpgraph", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "mapgraph", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Massively Parallel Graph processing on GPUs", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1886087}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Blazegraph (formerly Bigdata)", "mount_point": "bigdata", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Code (Git)", "mount_point": "code_git", "name": "git"}, {"label": "SVN (Legacy - Use GIT)", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mpgraph/", "video_url": null}
