DSOL has support for discrete event and for continuous modeling. Formalisms supported are event scheduling, DEVS, flow-based simulation, and continuous modeling through sets of differential equations. The first release was introduced at IEEE's Winter Simulation Conference in 2002. Since then, numerous papers and PhD dissertations have been developed, with applications in the fields of transportation and traffic, logistics, supply chain management, gaming and training, health care, and many others.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dsol", "_id": "514cc23d34309d53d51f039c", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 77699, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bugs"}, {"mount_point": "support-requests", "name": "tickets", "label": "Support Requests"}, {"mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets", "label": "Feature Requests"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "cvs", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "DSOL: A Distributed Simulation Object Library implemented in Java", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Simulation", "shortname": "simulation", "fullname": "Simulation", "id": 85}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization", "shortname": "visualization", "fullname": "Visualization", "id": 135}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics", "shortname": "mathematics", "fullname": "Mathematics", "id": 98}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Information Analysis", "shortname": "informationanalysis", "fullname": "Information Analysis", "id": 385}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
