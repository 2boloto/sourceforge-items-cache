Since Github keeps the timestamp, it can prove that I do not tamper the portfolio after I know the realized returns. Therefore the performance realized later is the real portfolio performance. I will also calculate the performance of the last paper portfolio and publish it here.\r\n\r\nThe portfolios here are encrypted. But a potential investor (must be an accredited investor) can contact me and I will give the key to decrypt all my past paper portfolios. Then you can verify the performance on your own.\r\n\r\nThanks for visiting!\r\n\r\nBill\r\ndasheng.llc@gmail.com", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dsfund-papertrade", "_id": "5523639a1be1ce308460cf05", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2440911, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "Tracking records of my investing strategy", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
