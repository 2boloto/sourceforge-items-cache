Since Github keeps the timestamp, it can prove that I do not tamper the portfolio after I know the realized returns. Therefore the performance realized later is the real portfolio performance. I will also calculate the performance of the last paper portfolio and publish it here.\r\n\r\nThe portfolios here are encrypted. But a potential investor (must be an accredited investor) can contact me and I will give the key to decrypt all my past paper portfolios. Then you can verify the performance on your own.\r\n\r\nThanks for visiting!\r\n\r\nBill\r\ndasheng.llc@gmail.com", "shortname": "dsfund-papertrade", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Tracking records of my investing strategy", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2440911}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dsfund-papertrade/", "video_url": null}
