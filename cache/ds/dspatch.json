DSPatch is not limited to any particular type of circuit or signal, its generic object-oriented API allows you to create almost any system imaginable, from simple logic circuits to high performance audio process chains and electronics simulation. DSPatch's simple framework makes development quick and easy, allowing you to hit the ground running on every project.\r\n\r\nDSPatcher (http://sourceforge.net/p/dspatcher) is a cross-platform graphical patching tool for creating complex DSPatch circuits via a simple, intuitive user interface.\r\n\r\nDSPatchables (http://launchpad.net/dspatchables) is a repository for DSPatch component plugins.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dspatch", "_id": "5077a1771be1ce558d4bb019", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1026532, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "link", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "C++ cross-platform, object-oriented, flow-based programming library", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "shortname": "development", "fullname": "Software Development", "id": 45}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "id": 97}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia", "shortname": "multimedia", "fullname": "Multimedia", "id": 99}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Win2K", "shortname": "mswin_2000", "fullname": "Win2K", "id": 420}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
