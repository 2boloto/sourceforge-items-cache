Talsorian Games Inc's Cyberpunk 2020 roleplaying system (2nd Ed.). It automates the process somewhat so that it requires no calculation and walks the player through a step-by-step process.\r\n\r\nThere are a few houserules or interpretations/clarifications of rules included in this generator:\r\n1. The IP cost does not affect the initial character generation skill points cost;\r\n2. The languages are separated from skills now somewhat, in that they don't gain a bonus from their main stat (INT), since it is either useless anyway or means that a character with high INT automatically knows all the languages. Instead, INT score improves your starting language score (9 for INT > 5, 10 for INT > 8), and, therefore, the scores for the languages in your language group.\r\n\r\nThese houserules will be made optional in the future.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cyberpunk2020chargen", "_id": "55385f6e485acd3955eeab20", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2450190, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "A generator of player characters for Cyberpunk 2020 (2nd Ed.)", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
