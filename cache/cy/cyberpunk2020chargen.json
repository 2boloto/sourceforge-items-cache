Talsorian Games Inc's Cyberpunk 2020 roleplaying system (2nd Ed.). It automates the process somewhat so that it requires no calculation and walks the player through a step-by-step process.\r\n\r\nThere are a few houserules or interpretations/clarifications of rules included in this generator:\r\n1. The IP cost does not affect the initial character generation skill points cost;\r\n2. The languages are separated from skills now somewhat, in that they don't gain a bonus from their main stat (INT), since it is either useless anyway or means that a character with high INT automatically knows all the languages. Instead, INT score improves your starting language score (9 for INT > 5, 10 for INT > 8), and, therefore, the scores for the languages in your language group.\r\n\r\nThese houserules will be made optional in the future.", "shortname": "cyberpunk2020chargen", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A generator of player characters for Cyberpunk 2020 (2nd Ed.)", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2450190}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cyberpunk2020chargen/", "video_url": null}
