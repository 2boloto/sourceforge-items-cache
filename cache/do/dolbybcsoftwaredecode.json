However if your expensive Dolby deck breaks down, it may be hard to justify the expense of buying a new Dolby deck.\r\n\r\nI don't see why recordings can't be digitised using a cheaper deck, and then decoded in software.\r\n\r\nSo far I've written a program to decode recordings made in Dolby B. I also intend to implement Dolby C decoding, but I'm still working on that.\r\n\r\nMy program is written as a Windows command line program, but it can be run quite easily by creating command batch files.", "shortname": "dolbybcsoftwaredecode", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2459226}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dolbybcsoftwaredecode/", "video_url": null}
