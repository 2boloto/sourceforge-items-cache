However if your expensive Dolby deck breaks down, it may be hard to justify the expense of buying a new Dolby deck.\r\n\r\nI don't see why recordings can't be digitised using a cheaper deck, and then decoded in software.\r\n\r\nSo far I've written a program to decode recordings made in Dolby B. I also intend to implement Dolby C decoding, but I'm still working on that.\r\n\r\nMy program is written as a Windows command line program, but it can be run quite easily by creating command batch files.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dolbybcsoftwaredecode", "_id": "554d0a52b9363c1102932b8a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2459226, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
