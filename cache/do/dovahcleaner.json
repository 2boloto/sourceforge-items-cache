DELETING SAVES IN PERMANENT. Make sure you want all the saves the program selects do be deleted before you delete them.\r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but when playing Skyrim, I tend to just hit \"New Save\" when saving game, so I'm left with a lot of extra save games on my hard drive.\r\nThis program finds where these saves are kept, and deletes those that you select, without you having to root around for the folder manually. When you enter your windows username and hero name, a list will populate of all saves for that character and select each one except the last one. You can increase the number of saves to keep and deselect any older saves you may want to keep. Hit Delete, and they're gone! It wont affect other heroes saves, or any autosaves, so if you want to clean out the saves for all of your dovahkiin, you'll have to enter their names in turn.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your reduced number of redundant saves!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dovahcleaner", "_id": "4f3fc8f60594ca1a11001aa9", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 700607, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Small program do delete all but the most recent saves in TES V:Skyrim", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
