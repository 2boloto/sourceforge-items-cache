A typical way most of you do it is probably by creating topic-wise folders, if they are on your machine, or by book-marking them, if they are on the Web. If you have further sub-topics, you create further subdirectories. Soon, the directories grow numerous and deeply hierarchical. Worst of all, the categorisation soon becomes obsolete.\r\nWhat you really need is to quickly dump your documents wherever you want and tag them with labels. Later, when you want that document, you just do a keyword based search.\r\nDocDump allows you to do just that. Dump your documents wherever you want. Just remember to attach as many labels as you can. You may want to fish out the paper you had downloaded 5 years ago that was authored by xyz and had to do with abc topic. Well!
