The game is dojin fan game made for the anime zombie series \"High School of the Dead\".\r\n\r\nThe game is basically a fast pace maze game where you have 30 seconds to exit each level while avoiding randomly spawning blocks and intercepting zombies.\r\n\r\nEach level will randomly select one of the 5 characters from the anime: Takashi, Kota, Rei, Saeko and Saya. Each with their own amount of energy and special weapon. Each weapon damages and pushes the zombies in a different way, so you have to think about how to efficiently use them without wasting any valuable time.\r\n\r\nThe characters' energy levels will not reset, they carry them over when they are selected for a another level. But don't worry, the good Doctor will be there in every level to fill your energy to the max again.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dojinhotd", "_id": "51763d5d485acd447239b08b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1638833, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A 2D GameMaker dojin game for High School of the Dead", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "shortname": "sidescrolling", "fullname": "Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "id": 288}], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
