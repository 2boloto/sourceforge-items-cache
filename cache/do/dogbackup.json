It currently provides open-licensed music in ogg and/or mp3 format, for streaming and free download. \r\n\r\nThis software is a simple bash script that, once run, will start to download every song available from Dogmazic in the specified format, default being mp3.\r\n\r\nWhen the script is running, it is looping endlessly and keeps on downloading new songs that are registered on Dogmazic. Currently there's more than 50 000 tracks available. The script can be interrupted at any time, and when re-launched later, will resume the downloads at the point there were. \r\n\r\nTo use it, you have to know how to launch a bash script from command line, and how to interrupt a command-line job. \r\n\r\nPlease note that this script was created to be used with the version 2 of the Dogmazic website. Version 3 is currently being developed and the script will have to be modified once this third version is online.
