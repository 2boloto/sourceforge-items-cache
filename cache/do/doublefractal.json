Since then, it has grown including many unique fractals invented by its author. Some fractals were found by chance in 2001 when functions used for artificial intelligence were plotted as fractals. These new fractals were called JP Random Sets.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant environment Lazarus allowed Double Fractal to be ported from Delphi and now Double Fractal can be run on Windows, Linux and MAC OS X.\r\n\r\nFractals are infinite complex images defined by a finite definition. We find in fractals a model to understand many different sciences such as economy, health and weather. Many scientists love fractals.\r\n\r\nDouble Fractal is a program that creates fast and easily high complex images. No specific knowledge is needed to use this program, it is a program that can be run just for fun.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy the better than ever Double Fractal 3 with its brand new 3D JP1 Set prototype.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "doublefractal", "_id": "51452fbdea406b17230f5a1b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1389647, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Easily creates high complex fractal images.
