For web documents (HTML/CSS), it also will download all resources (image, script, HTML, CSS etc) linked with them. The process will be done recursively. This process is also called as web crawling process. All links URI will be changed to the local path, so that the collected web documents can be navigated by offline.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of two sub projects. The first is the library that can be used by different applications whose different UI design. The second one is the example of application whose a simple UI which uses the library mentioned before.\r\n\r\nThis library provides the interface to set where the collected documents/resources will be saved in. Currently, this library only provides a class to saves those documents in the files. However, you may implement a class to save the documents/resources in the database. So, it will be like something used by a searching engine.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "docsedoter", "_id": "51a46499b9363c317b1aa961", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1806687, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Collecting documents over internet (doing web crawling)", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: SQLite", "shortname": "db_net_sqlite", "fullname": "SQLite", "id": 531}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: ADO.NET", "shortname": "adonet", "fullname": "ADO.NET", "id": 835}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: .NET/Mono", "shortname": "ui_dotnet", "fullname": ".NET/Mono", "id": 469}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other Audience", "id": 5}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
