These messages can be anything and gnep is not intended to restrict these messages to any type or contents or format. A logfile watching daemon makes any logfile (e.g. those written by a syslog daemon) a source of such messages.\r\n\r\nFiltering, correlating and forwarding can be applied at each stage of transport. Arbitrary own implementations can be easily put into the processing loop. The messages can be encrypted during transport and senders be required to optionally authenticate (shared secret mechanism and / or SSL in both cases).\r\n\r\nThe included EMU (event management utility) implementation can collect messages transferred by gnep and make them viewable using the included event browser geb.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the super duper all-mighty stuff performing everything desired in monitoring, alerting or whatever area. It can, however, make useful parts of your toolbox.\r\n", "shortname": "gnep", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "programs to transport and process messages / events", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1926638}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gnep/", "video_url": ""}
