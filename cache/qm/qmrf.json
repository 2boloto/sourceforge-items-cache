This implies both a need to be able to identify relevant QSARs and to use them to derive estimates and/or have access to their precalculated estimates. To help meet these needs, the JRC QSAR Model Database is established and freely accessible through http://qsardb.jrc.it. \r\n\r\nThe QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) is a harmonised template for summarising and reporting key information on QSAR models, including the results of any validation studies. The information is structured according to the OECD validation principles.\r\n\r\nDownload the QMRF Editor  http://tinyurl.com/qmrfeditor  in order to describe your models in QMRF format and send the descriptions to JRC-IHCP-COMPUTOX@ec.europa.eu to have them included in the database. \r\n\r\nMore at http://qmrf.sf.net", "shortname": "qmrf", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "10705013", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "(Q)SAR Model Reporting Format Inventory", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 703205}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/qmrf/", "video_url": ""}
