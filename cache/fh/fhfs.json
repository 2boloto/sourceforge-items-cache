FHFS is designed specifically for account-based storage, not easily compatible with other uses or using over-top of an original HFS setup. Early development was started in January 2011, beta builds were tested in October 2011, and the first stable build was released on November 3, 2011.[2] FHFS was started to accelerate development on FileSplat.com, as well as experiment with the capabilities of HFS macros. FHFS is loosely based on source code from www.filesplat.com, and was created by the same developer.[3] FHFS is written in several different languages, including: HFS Macros, XML, XHTML, CSS, Javascript, DOS, PHP, C#, and VBScript.", "shortname": "fhfs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Specialized FTP/HTTP File Hosting Server", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 618200}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fhfs/", "video_url": ""}
