FHFS is designed specifically for account-based storage, not easily compatible with other uses or using over-top of an original HFS setup. Early development was started in January 2011, beta builds were tested in October 2011, and the first stable build was released on November 3, 2011.[2] FHFS was started to accelerate development on FileSplat.com, as well as experiment with the capabilities of HFS macros. FHFS is loosely based on source code from www.filesplat.com, and was created by the same developer.[3] FHFS is written in several different languages, including: HFS Macros, XML, XHTML, CSS, Javascript, DOS, PHP, C#, and VBScript.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fhfs", "_id": "4eadb48bb9363c4966000bd5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 618200, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Specialized FTP/HTTP File Hosting Server", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "id": 12}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: File Sharing", "shortname": "filesharing", "fullname": "File Sharing", "id": 251}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)", "shortname": "ftp", "fullname": "File Transfer Protocol (FTP)", "id": 89}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers", "shortname": "httpservers", "fullname": "HTTP Servers", "id": 250}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "shortname": "php", "fullname": "PHP", "id": 183}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: VBScript", "shortname": "vbscript", "fullname": "VBScript", "id": 548}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: Other file-based DBMS", "shortname": "db_file_other", "fullname": "Other file-based DBMS", "id": 523}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical", "shortname": "graphical_ui", "fullname": "Graphical", "id": 456}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class", "shortname": "by_enduser", "fullname": "by End-User Class", "id": 534}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Win2K", "shortname": "mswin_2000", "fullname": "Win2K", "id": 420}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
