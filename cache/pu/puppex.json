PuppEX Tahr/Puppy Tahr is compatible with Ubuntu 14.04 binary packages.\r\n\r\nKERNEL\r\nKernel 4.0.1-PAE-puppex is used.  \r\n\r\nPACKAGES INSTALLED\r\nPuppEX uses the original Puppy Tahr Desktop. I have added the file manager PCManFM and LXTerminal. They are more useful than ROX-Filer respectively RXVT, I think. \r\n\r\nRUNNING FAST\r\nThe ISO file is on the whole 475 MB, which is due to me including NVIDIA Graphics driver 346.59, Gimp, Google Chrome and compiling tools. PuppEX Tahr is despite this still running as fast as the original, which means it runs very, very fast compared to most other Linux systems. (Puppy/PuppEX runs from RAM).\r\n\r\nMOST important CHANGES\r\nI've changed kernel from 3.14.20 to 4.0.1-PAE-puppex and installed NVIDIA Graphics driver 346.59. The Nvidia driver will be used if your computer/card is \"modern\" enough.\r\n\r\nDefault LANGUAGE\r\nThe default language (locale) is set to English.\r\n", "shortname": "puppex", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "linuxexton", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/extonlinux", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "PuppEX Tahr is a remaster of Puppy Linux Tahr 6.0", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 649766}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/puppex/", "video_url": null}
