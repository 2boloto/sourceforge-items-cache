It's one solution to centrally handling uploads from a number of users, and extensive logging is provided by a Perl+MySQL combination. The key feature of  the software is that duplicate files should be detected, and incoming files have an MD5 checksum automatically generated. All upload details, including timestamp, uploaded-by, checksum, filename and location are all stored in a 2-table database. The software should not impact the FTP server software as it is run separately. Coming soon will be a complementary application that will run as a daemon and scan the logging database on a regular basis. Specific processing/handling will be available on a per-user basis. The package includes all documentation and scripts to help set up the MySQL database. The script is easy to configure for your own needs. Some Perl DBI knowledge is useful if you intend to modify the script, but not essential.
