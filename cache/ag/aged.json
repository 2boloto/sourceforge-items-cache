These features can then be visualized and you can evaluate them in a statistical manner.\r\n\r\nThis type of analysis is particularly worthwile in the assessment of biological experiments. Elliptic Fourier Descriptors have been applied in a large range of applications in biology. Examples include the distinguishing of leaf shapes, fish sex, organ size and so forth.\r\n\r\nAgED is intended for scientific use only.
