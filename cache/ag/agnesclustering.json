The aim is to identify (cryptic) taxa based on numeric data on morphology. The first step is a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) based on subunits (ant nests) independent of any taxon information. Following analysis are Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and k-Means clustering. The NMDS scores are also summarized using K-Means. For comparison, k-Means is also run on the nest means (without preceeding LDA). Cluster assignment is summarized in an output file for all three methods.", "summary": "R script to run several clustering algorithms using morphometric data", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1284923, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "agnesclustering", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/markusgoerlitz/", "username": "markusgoerlitz", "name": "Markus Ritz"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "id": 868}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "id": 97}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Ecosystem Sciences", "fullname": "Ecosystem Sciences", "shortname": "ecosystem_sciences", "id": 568}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Test and Measurement", "fullname": "Test and Measurement", "shortname": "testmeasure", "id": 825}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
