The aim is to identify (cryptic) taxa based on numeric data on morphology. The first step is a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) based on subunits (ant nests) independent of any taxon information. Following analysis are Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and k-Means clustering. The NMDS scores are also summarized using K-Means. For comparison, k-Means is also run on the nest means (without preceeding LDA). Cluster assignment is summarized in an output file for all three methods.", "shortname": "agnesclustering", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "R script to run several clustering algorithms using morphometric data", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1284923}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/agnesclustering/", "video_url": ""}
