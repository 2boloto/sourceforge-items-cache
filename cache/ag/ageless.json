Plenty of tools have been developed for the analysis of NGS data that are mostly catered towards diploid genomes. Despite such a rich tool set, it is difficult to improvise and use them on genomes which are aneuploid. We were also handicapped by the lack of suitable analytical pipeline that allows studying the experimental hybrids systematically. We therefore addressed this issue by developing a novel Java based suite of utilities called AGELESS.", "shortname": "ageless", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Software for systematic study of Parents and their hybrids", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2463202}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ageless/", "video_url": null}
