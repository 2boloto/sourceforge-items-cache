These can be used in the logic of the site on the server side.\r\n\r\nWhen a request is received, it looks at the User Agent String of the incoming header and matches it against the database. If there is a match, the device capabilities are stored as PHP and Javascript variables for you to use in shaping how your site is served out.\r\n\r\nIf there is no match, the request is re-directed to a javascript 'learning page' where the database is updated with the client capabilities and is redirected back. This happens in a flash.\r\n\r\nThe 'learning page' uses Javascript and Modernizr. There is a learning logic built in to avoid incorrect records. You can set a barrier which determines how many identical records need to be 'learned' from unique IP's before the record becomes 'official'. An 'official' record never diverts to the learning page.", "shortname": "agent-iq", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Informing web servers about device capabilities ", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 884040}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/agent-iq/", "video_url": ""}
