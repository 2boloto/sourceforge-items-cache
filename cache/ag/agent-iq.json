These can be used in the logic of the site on the server side.\r\n\r\nWhen a request is received, it looks at the User Agent String of the incoming header and matches it against the database. If there is a match, the device capabilities are stored as PHP and Javascript variables for you to use in shaping how your site is served out.\r\n\r\nIf there is no match, the request is re-directed to a javascript 'learning page' where the database is updated with the client capabilities and is redirected back. This happens in a flash.\r\n\r\nThe 'learning page' uses Javascript and Modernizr. There is a learning logic built in to avoid incorrect records. You can set a barrier which determines how many identical records need to be 'learned' from unique IP's before the record becomes 'official'. An 'official' record never diverts to the learning page.", "summary": "Informing web servers about device capabilities ", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 884040, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "agent-iq", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/citkane/", "username": "citkane", "name": "Michael Jonker"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/agent-iq/screenshot/agentiq.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/agent-iq/screenshot/agentiq.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "agent-iq.com", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "fullname": "PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "shortname": "db_net_pgsql", "id": 525}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "fullname": "SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "id": 508}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP", "fullname": "WWW/HTTP", "shortname": "www", "id": 90}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content", "fullname": "Dynamic Content", "shortname": "dynamic", "id": 92}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers", "fullname": "HTTP Servers", "shortname": "httpservers", "id": 250}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "fullname": "Architects", "shortname": "architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
