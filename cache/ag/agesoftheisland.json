A single player can play alone, but it is designed to be a multiplayer game. One of the players must begin a new game (as host), and all other players need to know the i.p. address of the host in order to join the game. When all players are ready, the map is shown and the game begins. \r\nTo know your ip address on linux: sudo ifconfig\r\nand look next to \"inet addr:\". On windows: ipconfig\r\n    \r\nThe goal of the game is to build settlements, roads, cities and more, to be able to gather resources and be able to build even more. Players interact at the same time in the same board, so strategy is important.\r\n\r\nThe main keys used are the following:\r\n  Arrow keys: Move the token \r\n  Space bar: Buy stuff (currently settlements only)", "shortname": "agesoftheisland", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Real-time strategy game developed on python, pygame", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2333599}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/agesoftheisland/", "video_url": null}
