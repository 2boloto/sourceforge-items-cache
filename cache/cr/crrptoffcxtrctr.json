In advanced mode the program can fix the zip structure of these new \"Office Open XML\" format files, a step which I now recommend despite our dissuasive blurb which comes up when you start that function.\r\n \r\nAdvanced mode also allows recovering images and if you are familiar with XML, includes is a basic XML editor for editing corrupt XML which might be causing the docx, xlsx or pptx corruption.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I recommend using trying newer program, Savvy Office Recovery, which is available on Sourceforge. It will often recover formatting as well as text. Also of possible interest are S2 Recovery Tools for Excel and  S2 Recovery Tools for Word on Sourceforge. The last two use different algorithms than the present program.\r\n\r\nPreviously known as Corrupt Office Extractor and Corrupt Office 2007 - 2013 Text Extractor.", "shortname": "crrptoffcxtrctr", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Extracts text/data from corrupt MS Office 2007-13 format files.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 706662}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crrptoffcxtrctr/", "video_url": ""}
