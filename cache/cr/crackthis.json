We developed a truly irreversible one way algorithm which, when applied to information, both encrypts and decrypts it. That is to say that the algorithm which encrypts the information works in the same direction as the algorithm that decrypts it. This in itself is the very nature of quantum mechanics - \"forward only\".\r\n\r\nThrough a quantum-entanglement-like operation, we created very robust encryption methodology which will secure information for some time to come through sheer numbers and flexibility. With 2^65536 possible keys a brute force attack on a key is simply infeasible.\r\n\r\nThe full version, due to release March 11, 2013 will allow password protection which helps protect your information by forcing the impostor to not only produce the 65536 bit key, but have your password as well and allows for individual passwords for individual files.", "shortname": "crackthis", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Data Encrypton Software utilizing IMPACT", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1323965}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crackthis/", "video_url": ""}
