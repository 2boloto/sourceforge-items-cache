We developed a truly irreversible one way algorithm which, when applied to information, both encrypts and decrypts it. That is to say that the algorithm which encrypts the information works in the same direction as the algorithm that decrypts it. This in itself is the very nature of quantum mechanics - \"forward only\".\r\n\r\nThrough a quantum-entanglement-like operation, we created very robust encryption methodology which will secure information for some time to come through sheer numbers and flexibility. With 2^65536 possible keys a brute force attack on a key is simply infeasible.\r\n\r\nThe full version, due to release March 11, 2013 will allow password protection which helps protect your information by forcing the impostor to not only produce the 65536 bit key, but have your password as well and allows for individual passwords for individual files.", "summary": "Data Encrypton Software utilizing IMPACT", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1323965, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "crackthis", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ayresenterprise/", "username": "ayresenterprise", "name": "Ayres Enterprises LLC"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crackthis/screenshot/MainWindow.jpg", "caption": "Main Window", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crackthis/screenshot/MainWindow.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crackthis/screenshot/SettingsWindow.jpg", "caption": "Settings Window", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crackthis/screenshot/SettingsWindow.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.admystuff.com", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "id": 230}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "id": 868}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Cryptography", "fullname": "Cryptography", "shortname": "cryptography", "id": 44}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Government", "fullname": "Government", "shortname": "government", "id": 569}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Security", "fullname": "Security", "shortname": "secindustry", "id": 867}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}]}}
