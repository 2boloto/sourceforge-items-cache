Crichton calls its primary users 'tenants'. They are the people that own products (usually web applications), write the code for those products, and otherwise manage them.

Crichton is also used by tenants to define versioned releases of those products that contain enough information to be able to deploy the product.\r\n\r\nCrichton is a management information system: it collects and produces information but it makes no changes to other systems, though other automated tools can use Crichton as an information source.\r\n\r\nThe Crichton user guide is the primary documentation for tenants.\r\n\r\nCrichton is can also be used by Operations as part of the deployment process or continuous delivery.", "shortname": "crichton", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 810172}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crichton/", "video_url": ""}
