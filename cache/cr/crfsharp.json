It is widely used in Natural Language Process (NLP) tasks, for example: word breaker, postagging, named entity recognized, query chunking and so on.\r\n\r\nCRF#'s mainly algorithm is the same as CRF++ written by Taku Kudo. It encodes model parameters by L-BFGS.  Moreover, it has many significant improvement than CRF++, such as totally parallel encoding, optimizing memory usage and so on. \r\n\r\nCurrently, when training corpus, compared with CRF++, CRF# can make full use of multi-core CPUs and only uses very low memory, and memory grow is very smoothly and slowly while amount of training corpus, tags increase. with multi-threads process, CRF# is more suitable for large data and tags training than CRF++ now. For example, in machine with 64GB, CRF# encodes model with more than 4.5 hundred million features quickly.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "crfsharp", "_id": "517971492718467af2de28ab", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 524303, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "CRFSharp is a .NET(C#) implementation of Conditional Random Field", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Information Analysis", "shortname": "informationanalysis", "fullname": "Information Analysis", "id": 385}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Linguistics", "shortname": "linguistics", "fullname": "Linguistics", "id": 741}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence :: Machine Learning", "shortname": "machinelearning", "fullname": "Machine Learning", "id": 802}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other Audience", "id": 5}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Chinese (Simplified)", "shortname": "chinesesimplified", "fullname": "Chinese (Simplified)", "id": 382}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
