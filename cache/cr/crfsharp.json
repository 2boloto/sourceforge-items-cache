It is widely used in Natural Language Process (NLP) tasks, for example: word breaker, postagging, named entity recognized, query chunking and so on.\r\n\r\nCRF#'s mainly algorithm is the same as CRF++ written by Taku Kudo. It encodes model parameters by L-BFGS.  Moreover, it has many significant improvement than CRF++, such as totally parallel encoding, optimizing memory usage and so on. \r\n\r\nCurrently, when training corpus, compared with CRF++, CRF# can make full use of multi-core CPUs and only uses very low memory, and memory grow is very smoothly and slowly while amount of training corpus, tags increase. with multi-threads process, CRF# is more suitable for large data and tags training than CRF++ now. For example, in machine with 64GB, CRF# encodes model with more than 4.5 hundred million features quickly.", "shortname": "crfsharp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "CRFSharp is a .NET(C#) implementation of Conditional Random Field", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 524303}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crfsharp/", "video_url": ""}
