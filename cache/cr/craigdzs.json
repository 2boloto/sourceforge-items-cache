It started as an idea of a full map zombie survival mission, much like DayZ, but this came before DayZ. I wanted something that was different every time, that you could port to any map, and provided tons of fun. This is what I came up with.\r\n\r\nDZS has 36 parameters that the host can choose. These allow you near endless customization of your zombie experience. You can play in the day, the night, the dusk,with fog, with rain, with clear skies, or make it a surprise. You can start with weapons, without weapons, with/without maps, with your friends, in the middle of nowhere. You can find weapons in buildings, in cars, and in ammo boxes. Loot can be plentiful, or extremely scarce. The mission can have hundreds of cars, or a scant few. Zombies can sense you from miles away or can be fairly stupid. The only limit is your server.", "summary": "Dynamic Zombie Sandbox, Fully Dynamic Free Roam Zombie Experience", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 839095, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "craigdzs", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/craig-vg/", "username": "craig-vg", "name": "Craig Vander Galien"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://www.moddb.com/mods/bobtoms-arma2-missions", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
