The grid must be rectangular, and only horizontal (across) and vertical (down) fields are supported. \r\n\r\n* Write and edit clues for the fields in the grid. A clue may encompass more than one field, and a single field may have more than one clue.\r\n\r\n* Specify a title as well as multiple paragraphs of styled text before the grid and after the clues. \r\n\r\n* Enter answers in the grid, and complete a crossword over several sessions.\r\n\r\n* Display the solution to the crossword, which may be included with it or loaded from a URL.  The solution may be encrypted. \r\n\r\n* Import a crossword from an external source (eg, a web page) by \"capturing\" its grid and clues. A grid is captured by selecting its region in an image (eg, a screenshot).\r\n\r\n* Export the crossword as an HTML page.", "shortname": "crosswordeditor", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Java application for creating, editing and solving crosswords", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2321773}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crosswordeditor/", "video_url": null}
