With it, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n* Design a grid with either blocks or bars as separators and with one of several kinds of symmetry. The grid must be rectangular, and only horizontal (across) and vertical (down) fields are supported. \r\n\r\n* Write and edit clues for the fields in the grid. A clue may encompass more than one field, and a single field may have more than one clue.\r\n\r\n* Specify a title as well as multiple paragraphs of styled text before the grid and after the clues. \r\n\r\n* Enter answers in the grid, and complete a crossword over several sessions.\r\n\r\n* Display the solution to the crossword, which may be included with it or loaded from a URL.  The solution may be encrypted. \r\n\r\n* Import a crossword from an external source (eg, a web page) by \"capturing\" its grid and clues. A grid is captured by selecting its region in an image (eg, a screenshot).\r\n\r\n* Export the crossword as an HTML page.", "summary": "A Java application for creating, editing and solving crosswords", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2321773, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "crosswordeditor", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/blankaspect/", "username": "blankaspect", "name": "blankaspect"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crosswordeditor/screenshot/screenshot-722x880.png", "caption": "A crossword with a blocked grid (and some bogus grid entries).", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crosswordeditor/screenshot/screenshot-722x880.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crosswordeditor/screenshot/screenshot-650x902.png", "caption": "A crossword with a barred grid.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/crosswordeditor/screenshot/screenshot-650x902.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://crosswordeditor.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "id": 471}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games", "fullname": "Puzzle Games", "shortname": "Puzzles", "id": 268}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
