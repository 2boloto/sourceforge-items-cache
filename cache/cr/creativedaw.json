This DAW, under active development, is developed with commercial music packages and music hardware in mind. The workstation looks and feels like a Macintosh, bundled with (64bit, >1.4Ghz) hardware, can be used out-of-the-box by musicians. The software also allows purchase of -commercial- licenses like Ardour and Bitwig. One commercial jazz release: \"Mind the Gap\", by jazz-artist and techno-guru-programmer Herbie van Tetering (maker), was already created (with CreativeDAW) and published (on CD Baby) online.", "shortname": "creativedaw", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Creative Digital Audio Workstation", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2434958}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/creativedaw/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/oPyOCm0uQ-I?rel=0"}
