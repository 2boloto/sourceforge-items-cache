This DAW, under active development, is developed with commercial music packages and music hardware in mind. The workstation looks and feels like a Macintosh, bundled with (64bit, >1.4Ghz) hardware, can be used out-of-the-box by musicians. The software also allows purchase of -commercial- licenses like Ardour and Bitwig.
