The release tag could be customized arbitrarily by configuration files, thus the management of legacy code and patches could be handled as required. The creation of repositories from legacy code of multiple versions and patch releases becomes as a result simply a call of the included script and could be easily recreated as often as required.\r\n\r\nThis project is just targeted as a small shell utility for developers. Thus should be adapted personally as required. Common issues will be fixed in the public source.
