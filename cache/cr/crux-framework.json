With Crux, the entire frontend code can be written only in Java. Crux developers can create declarative web pages using XHTML in a very simple way! The code in the application built is converted to Javascript and can run in a customized way in every modern web browser. This application can also run in multiple devices such as smartphones, tablets, desktops and even TVs. And all of this is done with no additional code.\r\n\r\nCrux supports several useful APIs, allowing you to work with REST, offline applications, social network applications, among others. Crux also allows you to work with flexible and rich visual components that can be used to build several types of applications.", "summary": "Crux is a framework to develop efficient Web/Mobile applications.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2413350, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/cruxframework", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "crux-framework", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/cruxframework/", "username": "cruxframework", "name": "Crux Framework"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://crux-framework.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache License V2.0", "fullname": "Apache License V2.0", "shortname": "apache2", "id": 401}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "id": 606}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "fullname": "Architects", "shortname": "architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
