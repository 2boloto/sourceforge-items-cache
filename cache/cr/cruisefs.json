CRUISE implements a POSIX-like file system in user space that stores data in main memory and transparently spills over to other storage, like flash memory, disk, or a parallel file system.  It exposes file data to user-level Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), allowing remote processes to access files with reduced CPU interruption. CRUISE scales linearly with node count and it has been shown to deliver 1 PB/s throughput at three million MPI processes on the Sequoia system at LLNL.", "shortname": "cruisefs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "User space POSIX-like file system in main memory", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1951340}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cruisefs/", "video_url": ""}
