CRUISE implements a POSIX-like file system in user space that stores data in main memory and transparently spills over to other storage, like flash memory, disk, or a parallel file system.  It exposes file data to user-level Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), allowing remote processes to access files with reduced CPU interruption. CRUISE scales linearly with node count and it has been shown to deliver 1 PB/s throughput at three million MPI processes on the Sequoia system at LLNL.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cruisefs", "_id": "5230f1ac81b24b7ae66affbb", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1951340, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "User space POSIX-like file system in main memory", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
