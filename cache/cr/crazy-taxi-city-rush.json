That game is Crazy Taxi. The wacky racer puts you in the role of one of several colorful taxi drivers tasked with picking up passengers and delivering them to their \r\ndestinations within a set time frame, while whizzing through traffic as ironically likeable late-1990s rock music blares in the background. Now, roughly 15 years later, Crazy Taxi returns as a free-to-play game for Android (and iPhone) called Crazy Taxi: City Rush. The game is stacked with ads and in-app purchases, but if you manage to overlook those annoyances, you'll likely find the arcade racer's look, feel, and sound live up to Crazy Taxi's beloved lineage\r\n. \r\nclick here to\r\n\r\nhttp://www.besthacktools.com/crazy-taxi-city-rush.html", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "crazy-taxi-city-rush", "_id": "547432111be1ce72a4d682a9", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2368849, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Chaotic racing action.
