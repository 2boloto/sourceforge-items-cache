Once these are complete there will be 32-bit ports to the 680x0, ARM, MIPS, etc.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "crystalos", "_id": "516f13da2718467af2fc1cda", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 514867, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Desktop Environment", "shortname": "desktop", "fullname": "Desktop Environment", "id": 55}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Operating System Kernels", "shortname": "kernels", "fullname": "Operating System Kernels", "id": 144}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: OS distribution", "shortname": "osdistro", "fullname": "OS distribution", "id": 798}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Assembly", "shortname": "assembly", "fullname": "Assembly", "id": 162}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: BASIC", "shortname": "proglang_basic", "fullname": "BASIC", "id": 539}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a user interface (UI) system", "shortname": "ui_meta_system", "fullname": "Project is a user interface (UI) system", "id": 463}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other Audience", "id": 5}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: Project is an Operating System Distribution", "shortname": "os_projectdistro", "fullname": "Project is an Operating System Distribution", "id": 438}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: Project is an Operating System Kernel", "shortname": "os_projectkernel", "fullname": "Project is an Operating System Kernel", "id": 437}]}}
