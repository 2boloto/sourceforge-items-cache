Xlai adds artificial intelligence capabilities to Microsoft Excel and a host of non-parametric analysis methods. Xlai's focus however, is on neural networks, in the forms of multi-layer perceptrons (FFANN) for numerical logistic regression (various optimisation techniques are included, ranging from evolutionary to back-propagation). Xlai has the ability to find relationships between continuous variables. Combined with the other statistical features included in Xlai (Bayesian classifiers, kendal tests, MANOVA), this makes for a powerful tool for regression analysis.
