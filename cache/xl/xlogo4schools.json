Some commands which were buggy in the original XLogo have been fixed. The interpreter works now more efficient due to the usage of more suitable data structures. The output of turtle graphics is now smoother and more appealing due to different rendering settings.\r\n\r\nVarious features have been added to support better user experience and satisfaction in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Translations:\r\nThe new GUI parts are available in\r\n* English\r\n* German\r\n* French\r\n* Italian\r\n\r\nIf you would like to make the application available in your language and if you would like to contribute, please contact us.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * News * * * * * * * * * *\r\nThe X4S Manual is now available on the files page.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xlogo4schools", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/markic/", "username": "markic", "name": "Marko"}], "external_homepage": "http://xlogo4schools.sourceforge.net"}
