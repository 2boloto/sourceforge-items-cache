The file may be translated. The translated file may then be transformed back into its original XML format.\r\n\r\n*Note: Future versions of this program will process XML Namespaces.\r\n\r\nOnce the tool clear Beta, and once XLIFF 2.0 becomes an official standard, this tool will be folded into the existing xliffRoundTrip Tool (currently for XLIFF 1.2) project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xliffroundtrip/) and this project will terminate.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xliff20roundtriptool", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bryanschnabel/", "username": "bryanschnabel", "name": "Bryan Schnabel"}], "external_homepage": null}
