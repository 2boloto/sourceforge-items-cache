Novel sequences are defined as DNA sequences in the de novo assembly that are longer than 100 bp, not known-repeats, and not present in the reference assembly.\r\n\r\nNSIT was written in C++ and runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit Linux machines. It requires about 2 GB of RAM. NSIT comes with a JAVA graphical viewer which can be used to view how the identified novel sequences compare with other sequence sets.\r\n", "shortname": "nsit", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Novel Sequence Identification Tool", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1970657}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/nsit/", "video_url": ""}
