This provides an alternative location for storing configuration information used by the Name Service Switch libraries, and may be used to supplement user, group and other information in a Berkeley DB.\r\n\r\nThe Berkeley DB NSS module provides an alternative means for storing configuration information traditionally kept in several plain-text files in /etc (e.g. /etc/passwd). The module uses the Berkeley DB Library to store this information in several database files in /var/db (e.g. /var/db/passwd.db). Using these databases can lead to a considerable speed-up if the files in /etc are large (e.g. on a system with a lot of accounts). The databases may also be used as a local cache for network accounts, or as a means to supplement or override UIDs, GIDs, home directories etc. provided by network accounts.", "shortname": "nssdb", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Berkeley DB NSS module", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 645338}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/nssdb/", "video_url": ""}
