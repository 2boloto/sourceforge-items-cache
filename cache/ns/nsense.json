Whit goal to make sensory substitution and super senses available to everyone. N-sense uses hearing as it's input port and is(will be) capable to allow multiple senses trough it as vision, magnetic orientation, humidity, velocity,time, altitude... Almost any data from computer can be made into sense and included into project.\r\nN-Sense is modular by design,  written mostly in c++ to allow optimal processing speed and uses OpenCv for Image/video processing. Target platforms are Linux, Android, Windows, Mac(starting from first).\r\n\r\nProject is not ready for public use yet.\r\n\r\nREAD wiki before starting use software to avoid problems!\r\nNOTE: software causes brains to learn and change in long run and there is risk of many side effects like: headache, dizziness, increased intelligence, changes in music taste, change in perception of reality.\r\nDO NOT use bad earphones or high volumes, they will destroy your hearing.
