It is difficult task to orient and efficiently use such a complex and even unfamiliar recommendations that results in omitting these recommendations during the development process.\r\nWith help of AGW tool the developer will be able to specify the main characteristics of the target group impairment. For easier remembering and use of target group limitations during the development process the selected target group will be presented through personas.\r\nBesides the personas the developer will be provided with an extract of \"a11y recommendations\" which tightly corresponds to target group. This extract represents the most important recommendations which must be unconditionally followed. Violation of these extracted recommendations would make the application inaccessible to the specified target group.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aa-tool", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/balatjan/", "username": "balatjan", "name": "DCGI FEL"}], "external_homepage": ""}
