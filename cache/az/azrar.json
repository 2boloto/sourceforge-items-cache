Azrar is a user-friendly tool for the encryption/decryption of single files - preferably compressed archives - addressing long-term data secrecy. Thus, Azrar provides the possibility to use webspace for secure data transfer between two communication/transfer partners (encryption only, network transfer not yet included in current version). Data in encrypted files are secret/private indefinitely. To achieve long-term data secrecy, Azrar differs from other approaches in terms of not to rely on effective computational deficiencies. It combines a one-time pad with a stream cipher method using the strong cryptographic hash function (family) Skein. Azrar fulfills business requirements for secure data transfer and supports several operating systems natively. It does not use a runtime environment.", "moved_to_url": "http://azrar.caracal-cipher.com", "shortname": "azrar", "_id": "52f3b959c4d104356107078a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2094802, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Encryption addressing long-term data secrecy", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Cryptography", "shortname": "cryptography", "fullname": "Cryptography", "id": 44}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: wxWidgets", "shortname": "ui_wxwidgets", "fullname": "wxWidgets", "id": 481}], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: WINE", "shortname": "wine", "fullname": "WINE", "id": 430}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Solaris", "shortname": "sun", "fullname": "Solaris", "id": 207}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "id": 202}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
