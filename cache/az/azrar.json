Azrar is a user-friendly tool for the encryption/decryption of single files - preferably compressed archives - addressing long-term data secrecy. Thus, Azrar provides the possibility to use webspace for secure data transfer between two communication/transfer partners (encryption only, network transfer not yet included in current version). Data in encrypted files are secret/private indefinitely. To achieve long-term data secrecy, Azrar differs from other approaches in terms of not to rely on effective computational deficiencies. It combines a one-time pad with a stream cipher method using the strong cryptographic hash function (family) Skein. Azrar fulfills business requirements for secure data transfer and supports several operating systems natively. It does not use a runtime environment.", "summary": "Encryption addressing long-term data secrecy", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2094802, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "http://azrar.caracal-cipher.com", "shortname": "azrar", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/aleru/", "username": "aleru", "name": "Alexander Rurainski"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/azrar/screenshot/encrypt.png", "caption": "Azrar under WinXP after file encryption", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/azrar/screenshot/encrypt.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://azrar.caracal-cipher.com", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: wxWidgets", "fullname": "wxWidgets", "shortname": "ui_wxwidgets", "id": 481}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Cryptography", "fullname": "Cryptography", "shortname": "cryptography", "id": 44}], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: WINE", "fullname": "WINE", "shortname": "wine", "id": 430}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Solaris", "fullname": "Solaris", "shortname": "sun", "id": 207}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "fullname": "All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 202}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
