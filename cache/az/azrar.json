Azrar is a user-friendly tool for the encryption/decryption of single files - preferably compressed archives - addressing long-term data secrecy. Thus, Azrar provides the possibility to use webspace for secure data transfer between two communication/transfer partners (encryption only, network transfer not yet included in current version). Data in encrypted files are secret/private indefinitely. To achieve long-term data secrecy, Azrar differs from other approaches in terms of not to rely on effective computational deficiencies. It combines a one-time pad with a stream cipher method using the strong cryptographic hash function (family) Skein. Azrar fulfills business requirements for secure data transfer and supports several operating systems natively. It does not use a runtime environment.", "shortname": "azrar", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "moved", "summary": "Encryption addressing long-term data secrecy", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2094802}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/azrar/", "video_url": ""}
