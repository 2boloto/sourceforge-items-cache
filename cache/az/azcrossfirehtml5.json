The game is still under improvement but can be played already :)\r\n\r\nThis game is HTML5 based so there shouldn't be someone releasing an installer or executable (\"*.exe\" version is a big \"NO\" for security reasons) version. Just open the \"index.html\" file from your web browser and the game should be running normally :)\r\n\r\nNote: HTML5 is an interpreted language and most web browsers are cross-platform so therefore this game can be played in Linux, Mac, and Windows.\r\n\r\nIf you want to provide files such as images (sprites and/or backgrounds) and/or sounds (effects and/or BGM), please e-mail me at jdp2ga@yahoo.com.
