This applications can be executed on windows, linux and macosx using the same code base with a native look and feel.\r\n\r\nOne of the ideas is that you can use your php web applications code base and logic to create native desktop applications that communicate to them transparently. This way you can give your users a seamless and native experience from the desktop while staying in sync with your web apps.\r\n\r\nThere are many more use cases, but we invite you to download and try this project by your self. We hope everyone can enjoy it as much as we have enjoyed developing it.", "shortname": "wxphp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "PHP bindings for the cross-platform GUI library wxWidgets.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 140351}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wxphp/", "video_url": null}
