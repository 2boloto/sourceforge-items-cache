With the popularity of the JUnit testing framework in Java software testing, developers are aching for JUnit test case management aids in regression testing of Java software. Typically, most existing tools are based on the coverage information. However, coverage information may need extra efforts to obtain. To make things easy, we present an Eclipse IDE plug-in (named Jtop) for managing JUnit test cases in absence of coverage information. Jtop statically analyzes the tested program to perform automatic test case management including test case selection, test suite reduction and test case prioritization. Besides, Jtop enables the programmer to manipulate test cases manually through graphical user interface.", "shortname": "pkujtop", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1999021}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pkujtop/", "video_url": ""}
