The parameter is typically a pointer to a structure and is used for message passing.\r\n\r\nTasks have priorities and a high priority tasks will preempt those lower priority. The low priority task will proceed normally when the high priority task concludes.\r\n\r\nTask may be scheduled from interrupt functions. This uses the Arm PendSV/SVC hardware in the background so peripheral interrupts conclude in the normal way.\r\n\r\nSupport is provided for the Arm Systick timer to provide delayed task starting, where a task can be scheduled to begin some number of clock ticks in the future.\r\n\r\nCounting semaphores are provided to protect serial resources and peripherals. Mechanisms for managing protected I/O are built in.\r\n", "shortname": "jenos", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Task based, single stack, priority driven, preemptive OS for Arm m3", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2382784}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jenos/", "video_url": null}
