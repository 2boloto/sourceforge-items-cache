The platform is comprised of a set of packages which provide transport, messaging, configuration, and execution services designed to create a configurable, scalable, and distributed application environment. The low resource model permits the platform to be instantiated during each build cycle and to be deployed at all levels of the application hierarchy such as application servers, web servers, and mobile or wired workstations. What makes the Jeuron Application Platform innovative are not the individual technologies used in the platform but how those technologies have been re-imagined to work together to create a unique application environment.\r\n", "shortname": "jeuron", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Jeuron Application Platform", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 375843}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jeuron/", "video_url": null}
