With animation style and themes reminiscent of eastern animation combined with the family friendly storyline about love and friendship, it was destined for success even before it first came out. Other spin-off titles that tried to follow in with its accomplishments did not all fare well however, maybe it\u2019s just better off just being a show. But still though, the abundance of toon games sites insist that Avatar be made one of its own, and what did they come up? Avatar- Four Nations Tournament; sounds good on paper, but we still need to see if it can live up with its name a little better.\r\n \r\nBasically, it\u2019s a pong game, but that\u2019s really a nice idea, at least is not another biking game that many toon games site and games like Play QWOP  are spamming out nonstop. Pong games are very nostalgic for older players, and younger players can find it exciting as well.\r\nBefore the game", "shortname": "jessijane", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1040655}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jessijane/", "video_url": ""}
