It is designed with a clear separation of the several concepts of the algorithm, e.g. Gene, Chromosome, Genotype, Phenotype, Population and fitness Function. Jenetics allows you to minimize and maximize the given fitness function without tweaking it. In contrast to other GA implementations, the library uses the concept of an evolution stream (EvolutionStream) for executing the evolution steps. Since the EvolutionStream implements the Java Stream interface, it works smoothly with the rest of the Java Stream API.\r\n\r\nOther repositories:\r\n- https://github.com/jenetics/jenetics\r\n\r\nMaven:\r\n- http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|a%3A%22org.jenetics%22", "shortname": "jenetics", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "jeneticsga", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 206158}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "API", "mount_point": "link", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Mercurial (dormant)", "mount_point": "main", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "SVN (dormant)", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jenetics/", "video_url": null}
