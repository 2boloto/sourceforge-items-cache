Since people do the the same gesture in different ways, before you try a gesture template trained by others, you may need to \"play\" the skeleton file first to see how the gesture was recorded. Or you may train your own gesture templates directly. See the usage for details.\r\n\r\nThe function is provided in a package for Unity3D. It reads skeleton data from MS Kinect or similar motion capture devices. To acquire skeleton data, we uses OpenNI 1.5.4 because it is an open source library. The scripts in the project are written in c#.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm we use is template matching. The structure of the code is clear and not very complicated. If you want to use it on other platforms, you may pick part of the scripts in the \"GestureScripts\" folder and try to edit them to fit other SDKs or platforms.\r\n\r\nThe usage and algorithm introduction are also provided.
