Genobuntu attempts to reduce the amount of time and energy needed to build  software workstations and it can also act as a good teaching source for a class room setting. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Genobuntu offers a well-tailored environment for both novices and experts working in the field of genome assembly.", "shortname": "genobuntu", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Genobuntu Package for Next Generation Sequencing", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2176160}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/genobuntu/", "video_url": null}
