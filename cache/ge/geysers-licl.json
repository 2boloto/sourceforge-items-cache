There are two different actors in the GEYSERS reference model that make use of the LICL functionalities in order to provide their corresponding services, the Virtual Infrastructure Provider (VIP) and the Physical Infrastructure Provider (PIP). To reflect this, the LICL is split into two software layers: the lower LICL and the upper LICL. Each one of the given software layers is devoted to satisfy the needs and requirements of each actor. Therefore, the lower LICL will be deployed by the PIP and the upper LICL by the VIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n\r\n1.User Guide - http://sourceforge.net/projects/geysers-licl/files/LICL-manual-v0.1.pdf\r\n2.VM image repository - http://150.254.171.133/vm_geysers/GEYSERS-D3.4-LICL-v1.0.ova", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "geysers-licl", "_id": "510a76ef7929e55b6b0762db", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1264041, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Logical Infrastructure Composition Layer", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
