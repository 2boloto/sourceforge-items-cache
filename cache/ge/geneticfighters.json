I've played around a lot with selection schemes and different goals, and while they can develop some rudimentary skills, they always die off and fail to improve. While they can learn a way through a maze, I'm not seeing any emergent combat tactics more advanced than move in a direction flailing my sword around me.\r\n\r\nAll in all it makes for a fairly retarded AI.
