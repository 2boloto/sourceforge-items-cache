The library is written C, using HDF5 as the file format for storage of all remotely-sensed data and ancillary data, as well as processed data. The C functions assume a particular format for the HDF5 file contents, and provide functions for reading and writing data to such files. There is also a Python API that provides a procedural as well as an object-oriented interface to these functions. A Python GUI for interacting with such datasets is also part of the project. While there are other open-source GIS, and image-processing packages available, this one is designed to be comprehensive, work on 3 major platforms, user-extensible, fast, and able to handle huge datasets.\r\nClick the Blog tab for more info.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "geoscipy", "_id": "52d45c700594ca74374620ce", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2071743, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "Python-accessible toolkit for Geoscience & Remote Sensing Applications", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Ecosystem Sciences", "shortname": "ecosystem_sciences", "fullname": "Ecosystem Sciences", "id": 568}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Earth Sciences", "shortname": "earth_science", "fullname": "Earth Sciences", "id": 567}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mapping :: GIS", "shortname": "gis", "fullname": "GIS", "id": 383}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Fortran", "shortname": "fortran", "fullname": "Fortran", "id": 169}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Other toolkit", "shortname": "ui_othertoolkit", "fullname": "Other toolkit", "id": 495}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
