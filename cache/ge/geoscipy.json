The library is written C, using HDF5 as the file format for storage of all remotely-sensed data and ancillary data, as well as processed data. The C functions assume a particular format for the HDF5 file contents, and provide functions for reading and writing data to such files. There is also a Python API that provides a procedural as well as an object-oriented interface to these functions. A Python GUI for interacting with such datasets is also part of the project. While there are other open-source GIS, and image-processing packages available, this one is designed to be comprehensive, work on 3 major platforms, user-extensible, fast, and able to handle huge datasets.\r\nClick the Blog tab for more info.", "shortname": "geoscipy", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Python-accessible toolkit for Geoscience & Remote Sensing Applications", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2071743}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/geoscipy/", "video_url": null}
