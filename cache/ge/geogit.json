GeoGit draws inspiration from Git, but adapts its core concepts to handle versioning of geospatial data. Users are able to import raw geospatial data (currently from Shapefiles, PostGIS or SpatiaLite) in to a repository where every change to the data is tracked. These changes can be viewed in a history, reverted to older versions, branched in to sandboxed areas, merged back in, and pushed to remote repositories.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "geogit", "_id": "516d9a44bcf63a6e7fe8bc88", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1581911, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Geospatial Distributed Version Control System", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Version Control", "shortname": "versioncontrol", "fullname": "Version Control", "id": 52}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mapping :: GIS", "shortname": "gis", "fullname": "GIS", "id": 383}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Non-Profit Organizations", "shortname": "nonprofit", "fullname": "Non-Profit Organizations", "id": 618}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Aerospace", "shortname": "aerospace", "fullname": "Aerospace", "id": 599}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Government", "shortname": "government", "fullname": "Government", "id": 569}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Telecommunications Industry", "shortname": "telecommunications", "fullname": "Telecommunications Industry", "id": 368}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Agriculture", "shortname": "agriculture", "fullname": "Agriculture", "id": 765}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
