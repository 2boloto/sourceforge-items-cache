Cancer is a major subject matter of biomedical research but identification of the breast cancer related genes is very difficult for a small set of samples. Biological systems such as gene regulatory networks will help us detect the breast cancer related genes and understand the complex biological process in a systematic way. However, the construction of such a gene regulatory network is very challenging for a high-dimensional situation.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gene2dne", "_id": "505ef24b1be1ce47a8fd7f6b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 972986, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "To identify the genes associated with breast cancer", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: S/R", "shortname": "s_slash_r", "fullname": "S/R", "id": 573}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: XML-based", "shortname": "db_api_xml", "fullname": "XML-based", "id": 507}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: KDE", "shortname": "kde", "fullname": "KDE", "id": 232}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: Chinese (Simplified)", "shortname": "chinesesimplified", "fullname": "Chinese (Simplified)", "id": 382}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}]}}
