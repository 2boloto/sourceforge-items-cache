In this paper we propose a method inspired in the laws of Gestalt to extract features from images and test its efficiency in the object categorization problem. Our approach extends the common used idea of features based on pixel-level and on the Gestalt laws of proximity and similarity. We consider other Gestalt principles to capture not only semantic information about the object's shape, but also its appearance. Our feature descriptor is based on shape analysis and color homogeneity distribution from which we also propose a novel method inspired in the self-similarity technique. We investigated different ways of combining and testing these features using Caltech 101 database and our results show that such approach improves the efficiency in categorizing objects in 2D images.
