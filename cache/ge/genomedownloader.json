Currently, the contents of subdirectories Bacteria (default) and Bacteria_DRAFT (-d switch) can be used for the searches, automatically. These two directories follow certain organizational rules that are taken into account in the design of this program. In principle, other NCBI subdirectories could be used as well, but some of those investigated so far do not necessarily follow the organization rules that Bacteria and Bacteria_DRAFT do. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that using other directories will work for all cases, so: caveat emptor, no money back guarantee.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use additional directories contents in searches, by using the -D option to specify the directories to add. This is case-sensitive, so PLANTS will find what is wanted, but Plants will not, for example.\r\n\r\nThis program runs in Linux but could be made to run on Mac OS X with a few modifications.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "genomedownloader", "_id": "54c116dc81b24b647b57fc7f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2397941, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Downloads genome data from NCBI based on search terms.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
