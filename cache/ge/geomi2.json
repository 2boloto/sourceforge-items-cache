The framework was developed by NICTA and University of Sydney, Australia. \r\nGEOMI provides cutting edge visual analytic tools combining network visualisation techniques with network analysis methods to enable exploring and discovering such networks for critical insights. \r\n\r\nA new version of GEOMI, namely GEOMI-2, provides a large number of novel tools for visual analysis of large networks. The new version gives more tools for visual explorations and interactions of such networks for patterns and trends in three dimensions. Some provided tools are very domain specific such as for bio-networks and social networks. The new framework has been developed at University of Sydney, Australia.\r\n\r\nCheck project's current status at\r\nhttp://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~visual/geomi2", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "geomi2", "_id": "517abe9634309d5ba87c8b4d", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 272573, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "The 2nd version of GEOMI", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Academic Free License (AFL)", "shortname": "afl", "fullname": "Academic Free License (AFL)", "id": 324}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "id": 16}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a 3D engine", "shortname": "ui_meta_3d", "fullname": "Project is a 3D engine", "id": 466}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a graphics toolkit", "shortname": "ui_meta_toolkit", "fullname": "Project is a graphics toolkit", "id": 467}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
