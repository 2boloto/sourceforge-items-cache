GESPA predicts if a nsSNP is pathogenic using reports from literature and various algorithms to assess conservation in orthologous and paralogous protein alignments. Using reports from literature, GESPA is also able to predict the phenotype of a nsSNP with high accuracy. The software can be used clinically to determine if observed nsSNPs are associated with disease. A host of annotations are provided: orthologous and paralogous multiple sequence alignments, UCSC annotations, reports detailing conservation of a nsSNP in alignments, and links to external nsSNP and gene information such as relevant publications. GESPA is connected to a constantly updating SQL server allowing for fast data retrieval. NOTE: REQUIRES Java 1.7.0+.
