GenOO-HTS models biological entities into Perl objects and provides relevant attributes and methods that allow for the manipulation of high throughput sequencing data. Using GenOO-HTS as a core development module reduces the overhead and complexity of managing the data and the biological entities at hand. GenOO-HTS has been designed to be flexible, easily extendable with modular structure and minimal requirements for external tools and libraries.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "genoo", "_id": "5170130881b24b016ae88435", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1604123, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A Modern Perl Framework for High Throughput Sequencing analysis", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Perl", "shortname": "perl", "fullname": "Perl", "id": 176}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
