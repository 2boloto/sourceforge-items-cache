The simpler the class hierarchy, the easier solution;\r\n2. The data structures tend to change over time, or not be known in advance, working with them must be maintained;\r\n3. All routine work ETL should be automated wherever possible;\r\n4. Compiling the code on the fly bail speed and reserve for the optimization;\r\n5.
