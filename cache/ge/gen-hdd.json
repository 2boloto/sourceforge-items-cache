This may come in handy in case you've distributed your media data across several HDDs where it may happen that one HDD is going to sleep while Winamp is playing from another. In case this happens, there may be a huge delay in playing the next track when Winamp switches to the sleeping HDD. The purpose of the \"Keep HDD Alive\" plugin is to avoid such delays.
