We just packaged previously created themes and made minor changes to them and combined them in an easy to install deb file. To install simply use gdebi deb installer or Ubuntu Software Center if using Debian or Ubuntu based Linux system. If using other flovours of Linux simply extract the deb file to your home directory and you can install that way as well. This theme is made for XFCE and includes the common Mac OSX window border that is included in the XFCE \"window manager\" in the XFCE control panel. After installing deb file go to control panel and choose mintymac-osx as your theme mintymac-cursors as cursor theme and mintymac-osx-icons as your icon theme under Appearence Settings on XFCE. Also works fine on Cinnamon gnome and mate desktops as well.\r\nPLEASE NOTE; mintyMac uses theme packs from Macbuntu, CratOS,  Mac4Lin and our systems use ppa from noobslab.
