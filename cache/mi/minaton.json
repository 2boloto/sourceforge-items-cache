The mod wheel controls filter frequency. It uses jackmidi rather than alsa for good solid timing, future developments planned are a lv2 / ladspa plug in version, pitch wheel control to be added.\r\n\r\nExample sounds can be found on my blog, any suggestions and additions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "minaton", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Minaton is a fat sounding mono subtractive software synthesizer", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Feature requests", "mount_point": "featurerequests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 626289}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/minaton/", "video_url": ""}
