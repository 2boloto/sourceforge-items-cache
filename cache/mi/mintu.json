This app was made on need basis in a university , we have a closed LAN network of over 1500 people on it. we have our own local IRC server and and we need to share small update files for example we need everyone to get the new timetable or the new datasheet or a society induction form. stuff like this can be set as a trigger on IRC and everyone can get it if they want. this will handle the scripting in the remote.ini file and you can simply add the trigger to the channel topic , just right click on any file that you want to set a trigger for and add the list of channel you want it on. You cab also configure to send a message explaining the file attached with the trigger", "shortname": "mintu", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "mintu Mini_Ninja mIRC Trigger Utility", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 774633}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mintu/", "video_url": ""}
