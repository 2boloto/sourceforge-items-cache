Scientists in this area have made substantial efforts to standardize experimental methodologies.  For example, consortiums have developed standardized reporting systems for human SCI studies (Biering-Sorensen et al., 2011), standardized injury devices, such as the NYU impactor (Young, 2002), and standardized outcome measures, such as the BBB Locomotor Rating Scale to quantify recovery of movement after SCI in rats (Basso et al., 1995). \u201cMinimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations\u201d (MIBBI) facilitate communicating methods and results (Taylor et al., 2008). Developing standards for \u201cMinimum Information About a Spinal Cord Injury Experiment\u201d (MIASCI) would facilitate bioinformatic efforts and allow  investigators to more accurately replicate and extend studies.
