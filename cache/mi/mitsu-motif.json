It is based on the stochastic EM (sEM) algorithm, which overcomes some of the limitations of deterministic EM-based algorithms for motif discovery. Unlike previous sEM algorithms for motif discovery, MITSU is unconstrained with regard to the distribution of motif occurrences within the input dataset. MITSU also has the ability to automatically determine the most likely motif width by incorporating an information-based heuristic known as MCOIN. In tests on realistic synthetic and previously characterised prokaryotic data, MITSU has been shown to outperform an EM-based algorithm and previous sEM-based implementations.\r\n\r\nMITSU is described in more detail in our paper:\r\nA.
