MIDITOR  is comparable to a sequencer. It turns any ASCII editor into a MIDI editor, for loops, sequencing and composing. Any MIDI message can be sent at specific times including patch changes, control changes.... Tracks and channels can be easily rendered in parallel and the powerful macro preprocessor handles the repetitious nature of music writing. Music is easily scored in any editor chromatically and then output as a MIDI file to quickly check and play the score on FluidSynth or Timidity for instance. Conventional style guitar and drum tab can be used, even conventional style notation using macros, or just one line of chromatic notation.", "shortname": "miditor", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "MIDI multi track song writing in an ASCII editor!", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1133220}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/miditor/", "video_url": ""}
