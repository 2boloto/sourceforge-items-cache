The simulation code base consists of simulated versions of most of the SPHERES core flight code and additional code that simulates dynamics, communications, and other environmental interaction.\r\n\r\nThe simulation is particularly valuable during the early stages of algorithm development and implementation as an aid in accelerating the learning curve for any Guest Scientist for SPHERES. Algorithms may be implemented in C or Embedded MATLAB and executed in the MATLAB simulation environment to verify general desired behavior. With some limitations, the code used in the simulation can be directly transferred to the SPHERES hardware.\r\n\r\nWe are sharing this project with the public to gather more interest for SPHERES Guest Scientists. Feel free to use and contribute to this code base, just don't forget to credit the MIT Space Systems Lab if you distribute any results.", "shortname": "mit-spheres-simulation", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "MIT's spacecraft simulator for control algorithm development", "tools": [{"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2119967}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mit-spheres-simulation/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/MImaDblgBrU?rel=0"}
