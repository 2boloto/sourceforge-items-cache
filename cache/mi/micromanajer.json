If this process contains tasks that have to be done manually, you might encounter the problem that sometimes you forget to do a particular task, even if it's documented somewhere.\r\nThe approach of micromanajer is to define the steps of your process as a set of \"tasks\" in an XML file, where each task defines dependencies to one or more other tasks that have to be executed first. At runtime, when \"starting\" such a process, the only interaction is picking one or more of the next tasks.and closing tasks that are in progress to \"unlock\" subsequent tasks for picking.
