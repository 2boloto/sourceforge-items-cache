A taxi driver is vulnerable to robbery, and violent attacks. A taxi driver will have not a way to pre-screen or consider the possibility that the current passenger could potentially attack or hijacking their vehicle. Many taxi drivers would not simply pick passenger from a roadside hailing or without some kind of phone call registrations confirmation.  This provides a limited amount of safety assurance for traceability if the crime such as robbery occurs. This limited safety can be done after the crime occurred and the taxi driver is safe to make the call or report.\r\n\r\nThe goal of our project is to develop an application on a widely available mobile system.  This application can provide a taxi driver with a way to call for urgent help. Also provide a third party with the updated GPS information for their current location by sending it to a remote server for monitoring.", "shortname": "mitaxi", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Mobil app to provide taxi drivers with a way to call for urgent help.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2189895}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mitaxi/", "video_url": null}
