Hybrid scheduling model (both event-driven scheduler and multithreaded scheduler are implemented, and can switch to each other when necessary) to make MIROS be a real-time OS and meanwhile keep a small memory footprint.\r\nB). Dynamic memory allocation, heap space is extendable and memory fragments can be assembled.\r\nC). Middleware EMIDE embedded inside MIROS. With EMIDE, the WSN application programming can be simplified, and the reprogramming performance can be improved. \r\nD). Multi-core hardware platform support to make the WSN nodes be energy-efficient and more reliable.\r\nE). System services developed by the state-machine programming to improve the reliability of MIROS.\r\nF). An application GUI tool is developed to generate the application code automatically.
