A PLOT >> Nothing in the keyboard or knobs of a oridynary MIDI controller, or any random synthesizer, results from a gesture, from a movement. It does not encourage experimenting, getting away or breaking free from something but just the opposite \u2013 it nails one\u2019s ass at the elementary level and has nothing to do with freedom, dynamism, motion and gesture \u2013 and after all these basics constitute the foundation of music. But if music is to be, as per scientists, \u2018an art of organizing tones in time\u2019 than why are we surprised?
