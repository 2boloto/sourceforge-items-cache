While strides are being made in the back office to integrate systems together and associate and analyze information from different sources, little attention has been made to the personnel in the field.  The information requirements of the deployed workforce are just as critical as those in the operation center.  There are vastly more personnel deployed in the field, so a low cost but reliable solution must be developed to address these demands.  Utilizing commercially available tablet technology along with leveraging the same messages being used in the back office between applications promises to fulfill these requirements.  This software was to develop a prototype tablet application to bring multiple streams of data into the field in a low cost but reliable manner.  It is ideal for workforce management and storm damage assessment.", "shortname": "midas-ffdv", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "MIDAS FFDV Source Code", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1180084}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/midas-ffdv/", "video_url": ""}
