When there is a task that has to be done by you, you activate the macro (through a keystroke or by using the menu). A window box comes up, where you can fill in the subject of the task, the due date and some other details. The macro also records in the background the filename if you were making minutes at the moment, the current date and a paragraph selected with text (hopefully related to that action). If no text is selected, no text is recorded. Afterwards you can call a report, from a database called TakenDB.odb, from within Writer. It gives all the unfinished tasks, sorted on priority. That database also contains other useful reports, which you can use if you open the database with Open Office Base. The database also contains a form where you can browse through all the tasks and make changes. I use this extension on a daily basis for my work.
