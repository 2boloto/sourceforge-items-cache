Although, this is possible and have been around for some time. It was possible for a paranoid to run MindGuard from a USB stick just like you would have run it from a hard drive, but this task was quite hard to do. Why? Because the process was very geeky! You had to type a lot of geeky commands in a terminal and if, somehow, you forgot one or typed something wrong, the process had to be started all over again. Well, the process is now not at all geeky with Mind Guard Linux available that makes it possible for anyone to create a bootable CD/DVD or USB flash drive with MindGuard in it. \r\n\r\nNoPAE ISO is for Machines with Maximum of 4GB RAM & PAE ISO is for Machines with Maximum up to 64GB of RAM.", "shortname": "mindguardlinux", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "/mindguarddroid", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/mindguarddroid", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "BEWARE!
