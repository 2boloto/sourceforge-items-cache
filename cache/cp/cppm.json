The basic principles of C++M are similar to those of COM and CORBA, but some key design decisions differ greatly. Some key differences compared to the former are the use of a hierarchical namespace and the use of human readable \u201cfully qualified names\u201d instead of GUIDs, as well as the support for basic metadata that allows the distribution of modules in binary form only, while still allowing extensive reuse.\r\nComponent proxies are central to the abstraction of the ABI and allow the C++M model to do automatic marshaling of parameters, automatic lifecycle management (RAII) and to support exception handling across component (and compiler/library) boundaries. These proxies are generated with a special pre-compiler from the \u201cmodule description language\u201d.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cppm", "_id": "515c1e370910d42fc1160f85", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1468427, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "An independent module architecture for C++.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Object Oriented", "shortname": "swdev_oo", "fullname": "Object Oriented", "id": 562}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Boost Software License (BSL1.0)", "shortname": "boostlicense", "fullname": "Boost Software License (BSL1.0)", "id": 678}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
