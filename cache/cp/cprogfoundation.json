They can be aware of data\r\n    changes by making pools in a while loop. Every access to the shared\r\n    zone is conditioned by acquiring a semaphore lock. Data in the \r\n    memories can be easily saved to a file. Each method is thread safe\r\n    so concurrency related problems are solved by the library.\r\n    \r\n    Program Base Library - lists, heaps, sets and more\r\n    \r\n    This project internally uses the \"PBL - The Program Base Library\",\r\n    created by Peter Graf. This library is also compiled and exported for future \r\n    linking to other programs.
