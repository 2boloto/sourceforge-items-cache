Furthermore base on automation, you can collect statistics over the time. By creating charts you show the progress of the team and help making the continuous integration process very transparent for the whole team.\r\n\r\nWe keep the following three parts separated:\r\n-- cppcheckdiff as command line tool\r\n-- powershell script for daily execution\r\n-- showing statistics with a web page.\r\n\r\nBase on your environment, you can use the 3 features together or adapt the tools you like.", "summary": "cppcheckdiff gives you the diff of 2 cppcheck runs + statistics for ci", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 868359, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cppcheckdiff", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/tranmh/", "username": "tranmh", "name": "Minh Cuong Tran"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cppcheckdiff/screenshot/cppcheckdiff_xine.png", "caption": "run cppcheck version 1.52, 1.53 and 1.54 on the same code, xine-lib-1.1.20", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cppcheckdiff/screenshot/cppcheckdiff_xine.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "fullname": "C#", "shortname": "csharp", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Quality Assurance", "fullname": "Quality Assurance", "shortname": "quality_assurance", "id": 565}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Source code analysis", "fullname": "Source code analysis", "shortname": "sourceanalysis", "id": 754}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "id": 537}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}]}}
