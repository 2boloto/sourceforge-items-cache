It features a template parser that parses, compiles, and loads CPPSP pages automatically at runtime. CPPSP pages have a very similar syntax to ASP and ASP.NET, where all code is considered HTML by default, and server-side active code can be embedded using \"<% ... %>\". \r\n\r\nCPPSP is built upon the CPoll asynchronous I/O and utility library, which offers simple I/O abstraction, network abstraction, memory management, and container classes. \r\n\r\nCPPSP project home page:\r\nhttp://xa.us.to/cppsp/index.cppsp\r\n\r\nMain development happens on github at:\r\nhttps://github.com/xaxaxa/workspace/\r\n\r\nDocumentation is currently being worked on, but there is a doxygen reference at:\r\nhttp://xa.us.to/cppsp/doxygen/html/classcppsp_1_1_page.html\r\n\r\nGCC 4.7 or above is required even for the binary release because .cppsp pages need to be compiled at runtime.\r\n\r\nCPPSP currently only supports linux (due to the use of epoll).
