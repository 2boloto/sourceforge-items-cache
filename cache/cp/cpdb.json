Besides the database, also there are software tools, like a parser, to convert EMBL or GBK files to the CpDB relational schema. Once in the CpDB, one can extract unlimited reports from a bacterial genome using SQL. This software is part of the PhD in Bioinformatics from Anderson Santos and was developed under the Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (Cp) pangenome project. The Cp pangenome delivered to the cientific community 15 bacterial strains deposited at the GenBank dababase, between the years of 2009 and 2012. The full thesis was wrote in portuguese-br.
