Intended to be used in a terminal, takes argument(s) and outputs the result(s) chronologically.\r\nThe code is about 200lines, and benefits from the shunting yard algorithm.\r\nThis is not a complete calculator, don't know if it will be because i only coded it to enable myself to do quick calculations while in a terminal. Therefore it does not check for typos, and a wrong formulated expression may result into a segmentation fault.\r\nIt's infix notation, and as long as you remember to always include 2 numbers per operator(including -) it should be fine.\r\nIt's very important to give the exact argument number to functions as well.\r\nTo use the calculator in the terminal regardless of current path, add the executable to the path for looking up programs, or simply move the program into a path already set up.\r\nCase you're on windows there's already a program by the name calc provided by windows, either uninstal it or change the name of this executable.", "shortname": "cppcalculator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1838375}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cppcalculator/", "video_url": ""}
