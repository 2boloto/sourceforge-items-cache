It makes it basically impossible for a hacker who stole your password to log in to your console.\r\nThe way it works is simple but very efficient and it is being used by some large banking corporations in order to protect their customers online accounts\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is to define a second password (AKA the NinjaWPass password) from 10 to 30 characters.\r\nAt the WordPress login prompt, besides your current password, you will be asked to enter 3 randomly chosen characters from your NinjaWPass password. Whether your computer is infected by a keylogger or someone is spying over your shoulder, this protection will keep them away. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the plugin offers the possibility to receive an alert by email whenever someone logs into your WordPress admin interface and to block brute-force attacks.
