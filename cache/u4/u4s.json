The sun is too big to hide, and therefore usually placed in an area under your control, e.g. your front yard, or at your garden fence. The planet models come as small stickers, which can be easily \"hidden\" at light posts or trees. This should happen in the spirit of geo caching, i.e. no harm shall be done and part of the fun is looking for the next planet. To keep the stickers small, information about the planets must be retrieved with help of a smart phone from a website of which the address is printed as a qr-code on the sticker.
