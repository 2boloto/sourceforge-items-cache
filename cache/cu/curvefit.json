In many industries like ads, clothing, leather, the designed drawing by special software is in curves, the curves would be converted to line and arcs if user want to cut out them by machine. CurveFit is the library achieves this function that simplifies the lines and arc and keep the drawing in acceptable accurate level. This library accepts solver parameters and data , then generate optimized result. It can decrease up to 90% lines and arcs quantity significantly. This SDK (curve fitting library) supports most platform from 32-bit/64-bit Windows to Linux/Unix system, it supports .NET and JAVA environment also. Developers of CAD/CAM-systems can integrate it into their software, sample demo program with source code help you integrate it with your existing system or product and minimal programming knowledge required. \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "curvefit", "_id": "514eba1685540d4dc34bf13f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1426978, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "CurveFit is a software development kit (SDK) to optimize curves", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
