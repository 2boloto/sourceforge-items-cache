A distro for freaks'n'geeks, based on the mighty Debian GNU/Linux, with cyber-gothic eye-candy and speed and power in mind.

It contains heavily customized Debian Squeeze configs, as well as some manually rebuilt software (Midori, Vala - from official sources) and some components written specially for this distribution (for example, VampireFreaks Sanctuary Radio tray applet, written in Python).\r\nThis page is the primary download page. For all the news, see the main distribution website.\r\n\r\nNOTE (1.07.2012): the RC2 that contains critical update preventing login problems on some hardware will be released within 18 hours.", "shortname": "cultix", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A fast Debian-based Linux distribution for VampireFreaks community", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 806057}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cultix/", "video_url": ""}
