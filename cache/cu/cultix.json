A distro for freaks'n'geeks, based on the mighty Debian GNU/Linux, with cyber-gothic eye-candy and speed and power in mind.

It contains heavily customized Debian Squeeze configs, as well as some manually rebuilt software (Midori, Vala - from official sources) and some components written specially for this distribution (for example, VampireFreaks Sanctuary Radio tray applet, written in Python).\r\nThis page is the primary download page.
