Most of people are fed up with these same designs and they want some real change.\r\n            So the Serandibsoft  is came up with some nice GUI concept which was slightly adopted from Windows modern UI concept with some changes. This whole GUI idea was first taken by a design concept of Live Write made by Conner Monsees .Then some slight changes were done to adopt it for the application environment.\r\n\r\nThis whole thing is about being creative and innovative. And also the giant software companies should look for a real change in their GUI designs on their next releases. This CutePad will be a real push for it.
