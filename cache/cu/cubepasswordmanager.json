This only applies to Windows 8 users.\r\n\r\nThis password manager is very light-weight, extremely secure and very easy to use with a simple, no-frills interface. All the passwords are stored locally on your PC, where it is encrypted using a secure and unique encryption method.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Should you want to compile this yourself, this project was built using Visual Studio 2010. The DLL dependencies are included in the main VS files zip file(taken out of the \"redist\" folder of VS).\r\n\r\nThere is a folder containing the project written in QT, so you can compile and run this in Linux, although the QT project is not being updated anymore. Should you encounter a bug I will be glad to help, but I can't guarantee any major updates for it.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Various improvements to the GUI, a new and much stronger encryption algorithm as well as a new login screen.", "summary": "A secure and light-weight password manager", "tools": [{"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2318467, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/cubepass/", "shortname": "cubepasswordmanager", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/cube777/", "username": "cube777", "name": "Kobus van Schoor"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cubepasswordmanager/screenshot/main%20window.PNG", "caption": "Main Window", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cubepasswordmanager/screenshot/main%20window.PNG/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cubepasswordmanager/screenshot/login.PNG", "caption": "Login screen", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cubepasswordmanager/screenshot/login.PNG/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cubepasswordmanager/screenshot/new%20domain.PNG", "caption": "Creating a new domain", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cubepasswordmanager/screenshot/new%20domain.PNG/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cubepasswordmanager/screenshot/item%20details.PNG", "caption": "Viewing domain details", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cubepasswordmanager/screenshot/item%20details.PNG/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://cubepasswordmanager.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: .NET/Mono", "fullname": ".NET/Mono", "shortname": "ui_dotnet", "id": 469}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "fullname": "Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "id": 479}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Password manager", "fullname": "Password manager", "shortname": "passwordmanage", "id": 778}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "fullname": "WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "id": 906}]}}
