Using high-throughput validation assays in breast cancer cell lines, we showed that our integrative approach significantly improves on microRNA-target prediction accuracy as assessed by both mRNA and protein level measurements.\r\n\r\nCupid is implemented in 3 steps. First, re-evaluate candidate miRNA binding sites in 3\u2019 UTRs, as inferred by TargetScan, miRanda and PITA by integrating their scores, location in the 3\u2019 UTR, and cross-species conservation. Then, interactions are predicted by integrating information about selected sites, their multiplicity, and the statistical dependency between the expression profiles of miRNA and putative targets. Likelihoods for each predictive feature are computed based on a positive gold standard set. Finally, Cupid assesses Finally, Cupid assesses whether inferred targets compete for predicted miRNA regulators.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cupidmirnatargetprediction", "_id": "53da868da02bb15cde3fe2ce", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2294403, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "mercurial", "name": "hg", "label": "Mercurial"}], "summary": "miRNA target predictions by integrating expression, sequence and ceRNA", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
