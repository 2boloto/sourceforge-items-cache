As a consequence of this the initial script will only return information based on the environment it is running under which means you can access 32-bit repositories (via Windows on Windows, WOW) by running the initial script using 32-bit WScript (%WINDIR%SYSWOW64) or alternatively access 64", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "customddr", "_id": "52dd543381b24b2f0a41f7d8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2078652, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
