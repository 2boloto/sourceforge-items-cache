As a consequence of this the initial script will only return information based on the environment it is running under which means you can access 32-bit repositories (via Windows on Windows, WOW) by running the initial script using 32-bit WScript (%WINDIR%SYSWOW64) or alternatively access 64", "shortname": "customddr", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "robmvp", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2078652}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/customddr/", "video_url": ""}
