Not to blame the developers, however since they have updated the documentation on how to build Tulip in their latest commits to the repository. But unfortunately it requires that you build Tulip from the latest source revision in order to get this documentation. That can be difficult, and even following perfect instructions can be rather painful. Further, there is good motivation to offer prebuilt binaries for people in order to expedite their development.", "shortname": "tulipbuilds", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "This project is meant to host various platform/configurations of Tulip", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1997806}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tulipbuilds/", "video_url": ""}
