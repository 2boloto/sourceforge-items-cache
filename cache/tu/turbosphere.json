It is generally modeled after the Sphere RPG engine for its API, although the API has been modernized. It uses JavaScript as its game logic language, and supports many common file types for resources.\r\nTurboSphere uses Google V8 for JavaScript execution and SDL for graphics, audio, input and most other game related functions. It includes a map engine intended for top-down, zelda like games. Other, script based map engines are possible, and several have been implemented for TurboSphere's predecessor, Sphere (like the Majestic Map Engine (http://spheredev.org/smforums/index.php?topic=4496.0)).\r\nTurboSphere is largely compatible with the Sphere RPG engine, the main API change is the replacement of object creating functions with proper JavaScript constructors. This means that there are several completed games already made that work with TurboSphere, requiring only a small set of compatibility scripts to function in TurboSphere.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "turbosphere", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/flying-jester/", "username": "flying-jester", "name": "Martin McDonough"}], "external_homepage": ""}
