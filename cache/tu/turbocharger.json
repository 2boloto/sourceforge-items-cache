The turbine and compressor wheels are mounted on a common shaft. This sub-assembly is housed in the central housing. The turbocharger turbine consists of the turbine wheel and the turbine housing. The engineer exhaust gases are directed to the turbo wheel via turbine housing. The energy available in the exhausted gas is connected into kinetic energy by the turbine housing and is used for driving the turbine wheel and compressor wheels as both are mounted on commom shaft.\r\n", "shortname": "turbocharger", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Turbocharger", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1138858}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/turbocharger/", "video_url": ""}
