It contains a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned for maximum performance and compression with 3D applications (VirtualGL), video, and other image-intensive workloads. TurboVNC, in combination with VirtualGL, provides a complete solution for remotely displaying 3D applications with interactive performance. TurboVNC's high-speed encoding methods have been adopted by TigerVNC and libvncserver, and TurboVNC is also compatible with any other TightVNC derivative.\r\n\r\nTurboVNC forked from TightVNC in 2004 and still covers all of the TightVNC 1.3.x features, but TurboVNC contains numerous feature enhancements and bug fixes relative to TightVNC, and it compresses 3D and video workloads much better than TightVNC while using generally only 5-20% of the CPU time of the latter. Using non-default settings, TurboVNC can also be made to compress 2D workloads as \"tightly\" as TightVNC.", "shortname": "turbovnc", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/virtualgl", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "High-speed, 3D-friendly, TightVNC-compatible remote desktop software", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2207876}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Feature Requests", "mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Patches", "mount_point": "patches", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "VirtualGL", "mount_point": "virtualgl", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/turbovnc/", "video_url": null}
