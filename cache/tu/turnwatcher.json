Is there a way to do secret skill checks and saves for all your characters at once? Or an easier way to mix up the action by rolling initiative at the top of every round?\r\n\r\nIf you have ever wondered if there was a better way to manage your encounters, then Turn Watcher\u2122 is the solution for you!
