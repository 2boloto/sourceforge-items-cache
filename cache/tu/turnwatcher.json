We know that sometimes encounters are straight-forward and easy to monitor, but what if they become more complicated? How do you keep track of Orc number 12's hit points? How can you know exactly when a character will bleed out? How do you keep track of a character's new initiative order when they delay their action? How can you keep readied actions straight? Is there a way to do secret skill checks and saves for all your characters at once? Or an easier way to mix up the action by rolling initiative at the top of every round?\r\n\r\nIf you have ever wondered if there was a better way to manage your encounters, then Turn Watcherâ„¢ is the solution for you! Turn Watcher tracks any number of player characters' (PCs) and opponents' initiative order and hit points, freeing you to run your encounters smoothly and efficiently.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "turnwatcher", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/userid-554061/", "username": "alexis_wilke", "name": "Alexis Wilke"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/dooglio2/", "username": "dooglio2", "name": "R.
