In particular, we show that simple meta-learning based ensemble achieves better result than weighting methods. Furthermore, we propose a new one-class ensemble scheme, TUPSO, which uses meta-learning for combining one-class classifiers. We also investigate two new one-class classification performance measures to weigh the base-classifiers, a process that proved helpful for increasing the classification performance of the induced ensemble. Lastly, we show that TUPSO performs significantly better than the best classifier in the ensemble.
