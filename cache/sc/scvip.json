All the code is converted into a 3D model, something like solar system. \"Planets\" of that system are objects from the source code.\r\n    For example, the class A and its function A::F() are represented by a cube and a sphere rotating around it, these objects are textured with a source code of the class A and function A::F().\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently Scvip supports only C++ source code.\r\n\r\nThis version of Scvip requiers MS Windows 2k or later. Soon there will be cross-platform version. For now *nix users may use Wine.", "shortname": "scvip", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Source Code Visual Interpretation Program", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2111477}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/scvip/", "video_url": null}
