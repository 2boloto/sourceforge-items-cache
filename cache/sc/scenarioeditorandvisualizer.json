For the inclusive systems this means to make the best use of all interfaces human beings are blessed with taken from visualization, touch, voice, smell and taste. The right blend between visualization, simulation and virtual reality could hold the key to a solution. With reduced costs and processing power available and availability of experimentation platforms could hold the key to an enchanting learning experience.\r\nThe first step is an editing and visualization tool. \r\nDescribed in paper\r\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6629931&refinements%3D4278371973%26queryText%3DGlobal+Humanitarian+Technology+Conference%3A+South+Asia+Satellite+.LB.GHTC-SAS.RB.%2C+2013+IEEE#!\r\n", "shortname": "scenarioeditorandvisualizer", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Scenario Editing and Visualization tool for Scientific scenes", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1989627}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/scenarioeditorandvisualizer/", "video_url": ""}
