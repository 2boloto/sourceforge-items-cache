You can search for database schema objects using regular expressions, and output the schema and data in a readable text format, and find potential design issues with lint . The output is designed to be diff-ed against other database schemas.\r\n\r\nSchemaCrawler supports almost any database that has a JDBC driver, but for convenience is bundled with drivers for some commonly used RDBMS systems.
