Upload - Click the upload button and your screenshot will automaticly be uploaded to a image-hosting server and a link to it will be copied to your clipboard. \r\nYou just have to paste it to share it with anyone you want.\r\n\r\nThe tool is made to be as fast (extremely fast) and easy as possible. Everything is automatic. You only need to do stuff you want. Nothing else.\r\nTry it out to see!\r\n\r\n(The soruce code will be uploaded as soon as I've cleaned up the code.
