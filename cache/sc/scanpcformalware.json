The solution we published utilizes Metascan Client (embedded on the bootable USB thumb drive) to scan the computer, given that the computer is connected via LAN to a network hosting a Metascan server.\r\n\r\nHowever, some organizations may not have a network they can connect the computer to, and the embedded Metascan Client is not able to scan the computer without a connection to Metascan, which cannot be run on Windows PE, the operating system used on the thumb drive. So we would like to share another solution for scanning computers that have no network connection: the direct-connect solution. This solution is based on two features native to most Windows operated computers:\r\n\r\nTwo computers directly connected to each other by a network cable recognize each other through TCP/IP by", "shortname": "scanpcformalware", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": " How to use a bootable USB thumb drive to scan a PC or laptop for malw", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1917179}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/scanpcformalware/", "video_url": ""}
