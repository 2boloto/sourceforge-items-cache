Unlike Windows, which when moving the mouse wheel scroll the active Window, wherever your mouse pointer is located, Ubuntu scrolls whatever window is currently under the mouse pointer. \r\n\r\nIt has no UI, to keep it lightweight. It's only 14kb in size. \r\nTo enable it, just run the exe file and to run it with every Windows start up, put it in the Startup folder.\r\n\r\n*** Requires .NET framework v4.0 ***\r\n\r\n*** v1.2 Changes ***\r\n- app no longer activates the window before scrolling it, ie. you can have an active window and the app will scroll whatever window is under the mouse cursor without activating it\r\n- now includes a Tray icon with option to exit the app\r\n\r\n*** v1.1.
