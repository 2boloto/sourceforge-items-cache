The original purpose of the program was to provide the means for design and execution of experimental protocol interacting with the proprietary physiological data recording software. The core functionality needed for this task is to: show instructions to the test subject, start the recording of the physiological parameter, make sound to initiate the beginning of the movement, show target to the subject, capture the results of the experiment, stop the recording and save the result.
