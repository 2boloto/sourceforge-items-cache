One may think this is not useful, but Macintosh also has an IDE for their Scripting Environment called Apple-Script Editor and it is used quite often. So it may be a good idea to elevate BASH scripting with a similar IDE for Ubuntu Linux. On top of this, the BASH scripting Documentation is fragmented, so this becomes another reason to make an IDE for BASH scripting with documentation included. With support to generate code for GTK+ (YAD) dialogs, for automated user cases, the IDE becomes a complete Development Tool.
