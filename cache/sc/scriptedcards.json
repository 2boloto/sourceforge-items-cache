Most card games have a set of standard cards that you battle with and against. Scripted relieves the player of this burden and allows them to create their own cards or \"Scripts.\"  Players are given a certain amount of \"Points\" that they can spend on cards adding HP, EXP, and other attributes.  Shops are placed throughout the map were you can trade items for points or other helpful items.  Also in shops you can buy pre-made cards or decks.  The game is /NOT/ a scripted map and is entirely dependent on the player's actions.  Also determanating the way of the game are simple algebraic expressions.  Players who are inexperienced with the game will not find it hard to adjust to the change of the new game as it includes easy to read instructions that help the player throughout.", "shortname": "scriptedcards", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A Card game that changes everything", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 634870}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/scriptedcards/", "video_url": ""}
