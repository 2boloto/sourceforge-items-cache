The prototype is implemented in java and outputs reports in HTML format. It is designed to detect most of known taint-style security vulnerabilities. The tool supports PHP 5.3. It includes a custom PHP parser, which is able to understand the syntax of PHP 5 through PHP 5.3 and all new features introduced in these versions, such as the new object oriented programming support advantages and keywords. The prototype also presents visualization features such as the ability of exporting a visualized form of the generated parse tree and dependence graphs.\r\n", "shortname": "scattool", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Static Code Analysis Tool for PHP 5.3", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2066385}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "SCAT - Code", "mount_point": "scattool", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/scattool/", "video_url": ""}
