The use of SCNSL allows the easy and complete modelling of distributed applications of networked embedded systems such as wireless sensor networks, routers, and distributed plant controllers.\r\n\r\nPlease, read wiki page for more information.\r\n\r\nTo get the most updated version of the library, please check out from Bazaar repository by using bzr client as follows:\r\nbzr co bzr://scnsl.bzr.sourceforge.net/bzrroot/scnsl/trunk", "shortname": "scnsl", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 214356}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "bzr"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/scnsl/", "video_url": null}
