Look at all of the fancy buttons.  Look at all of the features you never use.  Now, think about all of the space, both in the window and on your disk, that those features take up.\r\n\r\nSchooner solves all of these problems.  It is a lightweight browser with all of the features that you need and none that you don't, built in VB.NET.  The design brief that I followed when I built it was \"it's a web browser for people who just want to browse the web.\"  Revel in the lack of extra features!\r\n\r\nSchooner's development name was YourWeb, so the code files are listed under that name.  It'll still install as Schooner, though.\r\n\r\nJust download the \"Schooner.zip\" file and run \"setup.exe\".\r\n\r\nYou can access the code by going to \"Files\" and then opening the \"VB project\" folder.  Don't open \"Code\".\r\n\r\nSchooner is completly public domain, liscensed under CC 0.
