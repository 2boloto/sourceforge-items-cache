Platform: *nix.  This in an alpha; expect evolution and broken backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nManaging a 1000 page scanned dictionary can be quite handy if you can just type in a word and the computer opens the volume at the right page.  SCDICT wants to provide exactly this interface.\r\n\r\nHow should the computer know the right page?  We assume that there is no text layer in the dictionary (they are often poor, anyway), and the only way out is to create an index, i. e. to write out the last word on every page (or every first one).  Clearly this information is sufficient to calculate the page for any given word whatsoever.  Making an index is an extremely dull task that can take you an hour or two, but this boring work pays off.  What's more, it may happen that someone has already done it.\r\n\r\nAfter you provide SCDICT with necessary information it only remains to type in words on the console.
