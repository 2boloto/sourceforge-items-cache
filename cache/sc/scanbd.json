It polls the scanner buttons looking for buttons pressed or function knob changes or other scanner events  as paper inserts / removals and at the same time allows also scan-applications to access the scanners. If buttons are pressed, etc., various actions can be submitted (scan, copy, email, ...) via action scripts. The function knob values are passed to the action-scripts as well. Scan actions are also signaled via dbus. This can be useful for foreign applications. Scans can also be triggered via dbus from foreign applications. On platforms which support signaling of dynamic device insertion / removal (libudev, dbus, hal) scanbd supports this as well. scanbd can use all sane-backends or some special backends from the (old) scanbuttond project. \r\nSupported platforms: Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD \r\n", "shortname": "scanbd", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "scanbd is a scanner button daemon looking for scanner button pressed", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 247953}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/scanbd/", "video_url": ""}
