ScorePlus includes both software emulator and hardware testbed. The software emulator emulates the communication and energy behavior of Smart Grid entities. The hardware testbed hosts physical devices, such as micro renewable energy generators (solar panel, wind turbine), energy demanders, storages, and topology switches, which are all connected by power network and communication network in a physical environment. Both the software emulator and hardware testbed follow the same architecture and interface, and the same Smart Grid application program can be tested on either of them without any modification.
