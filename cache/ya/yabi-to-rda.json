To help make this process easier, the CCG has developed YABI, an Internet based workflow application that is aimed at biologists who wish to conduct bioinformatics analysis. YABI integrates bioinformatics tools and data via an intuitive workflow creation and management environment. YABI can be used to access the NCI-SF in Bioinformatics and the tools available through the Embl Australia EBI mirror hosted at the University of Queensland. With the support of ANDS, QFAB has developed this software system to enable the publication of services and collections based of Yabi workflows and datasets. By sharing the description of their workflows, scientists facilitate the diffusion and re-use of their data. This website provides access to the workflows and datasets that have been made public. By login in, scientist can edit, manage and publish their collection descriptions to the Research Data Australia.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "yabi-to-rda", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ankunert/", "username": "ankunert", "name": "ankunert"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/pchaumeil/", "username": "pchaumeil", "name": "Pierre Chaumeil"}], "external_homepage": "http://yabi-to-rda.sourceforge.net"}
