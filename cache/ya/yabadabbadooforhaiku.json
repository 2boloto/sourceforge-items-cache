This makes it easier to write long programs: instead of constantly scrolling up and down between subroutines, you just double-click on the one you want to edit - more like we used to work in QuickBasic. Debugging, on the other hand, becomes a little more tricky than in the official IDE. \r\n\r\nYabadabbadoo does not require yab to be installed. It contains its own copy of the yab interpreter (yab4ybd) that does not interfere with any other yab installation you might have on your system.\r\n\r\nYabadabbadoo claims workspace 4 for its own use and demands a minimum resolution of 1024 x 768 on that workspace. If you don't like this behaviour, yab source code is included.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "yabadabbadooforhaiku", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/clasqm/", "username": "clasqm", "name": "Michel Clasquin"}], "external_homepage": "http://yabadabbadooforhaiku.sourceforge.net"}
