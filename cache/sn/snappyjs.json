We try and take away as much as possible the need for developers to describe \"how\" their website works and instead let developers worry about \"what\" their website is suppose to do.  We provide developers with a rich set of tools in which all we expect from developers is for them to describe \"what\" their website should look like and \"what\" their website should be doing and then we take care of \"how\" the website gets rendered and \"how\" the website works.  All our controls can be styled with CSS and are flexible enough to be rendered any way you can imagine.  We hope the tools we provide you out of the box are enough to achieve any interactions you want and if not, is easy enough for you to extend our toolset to achieve some interactions we didn't think of!
