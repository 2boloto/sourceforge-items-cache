The pipeline has been validated and streamlined by comparing its predictions to manually curated gene models in three fungal genomes, and its results show substantial increases in sensitivity and selectivity over previous gene predictions. Sensitivity is gained by repeatedly running the HMM gene predictor Augustus with varied input parameters, and selectivity by choosing the models with best homology to known proteins and best agreement to the RNA-Seq data. SnowyOwl has successfully predicted genes in 26 novel fungal genomes.\r\nThe pipeline can be installed locally for high throughput and control over configuration. It can also be run on a remote server through a convenient web interface for occasional use.", "shortname": "snowyowl", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "RNA-Seq based gene prediction pipeline for fungal genomes", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1896541}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/snowyowl/", "video_url": ""}
