I know it's unnecessary to put it on SourceForge, but I still do it to learn how to use SourceForge and SVN.\r\n\r\nThe game is programmed in C++, and it uses my own 'Game Engine', a sort of abstraction layer on top of SDL (http://www.libsdl.org). This engine includes texture loading and drawing, timers, a menu scripter and  text-, sound- and musicmanager classes.\r\n\r\nThe game has a menu, highscore system, sound and powerups.
