This is probably going back to the old days where the mainframe filesystems were record based, but I don't know the implementation there.\r\n\r\nThe record here is a block of data in a file which can exist independently. The way it is planned to detect a record is - the data which is written in a single go. If you take a mp3 file transferred to your computer from your thumb drive, the data is written in a single go. In such a case, the file consists of a single record. If you consider your email client, the e-mail folders are implemented as a files. Each e-mail folder will have multiple mails. These get added to the file as and when they arrive. With RBFS, each e-mail will be considered as a record. If your e-mail is added to multiple folders, instead of copying the data into multiple files, the record for the e-mail can be added to each file.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rbfs", "_id": "4f544550b9363c7802000570", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 714264, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Record based file system", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Filesystems", "shortname": "filesystems", "fullname": "Filesystems", "id": 142}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
