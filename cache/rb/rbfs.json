This is probably going back to the old days where the mainframe filesystems were record based, but I don't know the implementation there.\r\n\r\nThe record here is a block of data in a file which can exist independently. The way it is planned to detect a record is - the data which is written in a single go. If you take a mp3 file transferred to your computer from your thumb drive, the data is written in a single go. In such a case, the file consists of a single record. If you consider your email client, the e-mail folders are implemented as a files. Each e-mail folder will have multiple mails. These get added to the file as and when they arrive. With RBFS, each e-mail will be considered as a record. If your e-mail is added to multiple folders, instead of copying the data into multiple files, the record for the e-mail can be added to each file.\r\n", "shortname": "rbfs", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Record based file system", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 714264}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rbfs/", "video_url": ""}
