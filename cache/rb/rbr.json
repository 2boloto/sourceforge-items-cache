The application of this method is very broad, from science to industry, finance and health. The accuracy and robustness improvement of our method over existing method could bring huge benefits in some critical applications. For example, natural disaster prediction, stock price prediction, personal/population disease prediction. The fast-speed nature of our method not only allows big data analysis but also enables real-time recognition and predictions. The RBR framework also hints the mechanism of brain function and leads to a \"wide learning\" hypothesis. We believe that this method will make a great impact and enable many downstream applications.", "shortname": "rbr", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Random Bits Regression is a strong general predictor.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2314488}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rbr/", "video_url": null}
