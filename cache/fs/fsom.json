The method is originally designed for epigenetic profile clustering, as in the epigenetic research field; the signal profiles from different regions that play the same functional role supposed to be similar. But the lengths of such signals are always unequal and this feature of the data raises the need for method that able to flexibly categorize the profile sets with unequal length. Our FSOM addresses this problem and gives enriched information about the typed data, such as the similarity structure of the subtypes and the representative profile of the subtypes.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fsom", "_id": "53f3df270910d45a6fe0c37b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2308306, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "FSOM: Self-organizing epigenetic profile with flexible learning strate", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
