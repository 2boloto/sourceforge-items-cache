I have a coworker running Linux, and there's a feature (google freethefish) that lets you have a fish swimming around on your desktop.  I'm running Windows, so obviously, if I wanted a fish, I was going to have to do it myself.\r\n\r\nSince then, fsh has added a number of features.  You can have basic fsh, ninja fsh, invisible ninja fsh, sharks, laser sharks and barracuda.  Sharks will eat anything except other sharks, while barracuda will eat basic and ninja fsh.  Ninja fsh take the fight to the predators, and actively hunt down sharks and barracuda.  Laser sharks will shoot at anything they can eat once it lines up with their laser.\r\n\r\nYou can customize how many of each fsh you get, along with a number of other parameters (like whether predators eat or just kill, whether to show blood on kills, etc) using the fshConfig program.", "shortname": "fsh", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "An entertaining interactive desktop aquarium", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Preview", "mount_point": "preview", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 873591}, {"label": "Issue Tracker", "mount_point": "jira", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fsh/", "video_url": ""}
