I might update it and add other boards later.\r\n\r\nA final note: Any version prior to 2.5 will not work with 4chan (I cannot confirm about the other boards as I no longer use them)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xchanthreadimag", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/karan000/", "username": "karan000", "name": "Karan"}], "external_homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/xchanthreadimag/"}
