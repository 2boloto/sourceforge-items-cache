Revisions are created in a slowly progressive fashion to give the player some freedom about what they want fixed and what they want to stay the same. (Updates after REV04 are \"unnecessary\" updates which bring new gameplay features to the game.)  I'll find a better to do this eventually, but for now, this project can hopefully obtain some success. \r\n\r\nAs of now, you are NOT allowed to use any of these ROMS in the creation of your own game. This will likely change in the future, but for now, I'd like everything here to be PLAYED only.\r\n\r\nREV04 (Releasing on 2/5/12) will be the last speedy update!
