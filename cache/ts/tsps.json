It wraps computer vision algorithms into a simple, easy-to-use interface.\r\n\r\nTSPS was developed in openFrameworks for use in design, prototyping, and installed systems. We use TSPS for retail, fine arts installations, rapid prototyping, educational workshops, and provide the source openly for use in production. It builds on the backs of giants and our hope is that we can contribute ways to make it easier for beginners to explore computer vision while also providing a framework for experts to build off of.
