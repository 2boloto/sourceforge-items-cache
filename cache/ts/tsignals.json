The application also consists of an intelligent part where time is distributed to each direction in an effective manner. This algorithm takes into consideration the traffic densities at each of the four roads and calculates the time to be allocated to each one. This algorithm saves a lot of time when compared to the current system in place. \r\n\r\nThis video tutorial should be enough to get a hang of the application :\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luE0f6VSN5M\r\n\r\nSend your queries and suggestions to rbwapps@gmail.com\r\n\r\nCheck out my profile for other applications : https://sourceforge.net/users/revanthb3000", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tsignals", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/revanthb3000/", "username": "revanthb3000", "name": "Revanth Bhattaram"}], "external_homepage": "http://tsignals.sourceforge.net"}
