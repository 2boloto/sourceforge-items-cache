Note, this is not currently functioning, I'm working (albeit slowly) on this. Folks who wish to contribute/develop, please send me a PM and I will work with you.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to be a new iteration, but carrying on with the previous author credits, plus that of mine and anyone else contributing. It should be clear that if the original authors of the DrDamage addon come back and develop it, this mod will no longer be required.
