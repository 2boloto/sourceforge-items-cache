We used several interesting technologies such as informatics on microcontrolers and the building of a network, or the creation of an interface between vehicles thanks to softwares like CANo\u00e9 by Vector. We simulated the two cars by computers which were linked by ethernet. Moreover, we connected to them two GPS in order to give us the position in real time and display it on a screen in your car to prevent from an accident if the cars increasingly bring the distance closer. A microcontroler receives the data from the bus CAN by ethernet and transmits the instructions to the driver. We hope the whole project will be used in the future cars and as a consequence will allow to save lives on the road.", "shortname": "lynxece", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Lynx is a project of a network for car to car communication", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1450688}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lynxece/", "video_url": ""}
