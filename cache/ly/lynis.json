Main audience of this tool is security consultants, auditors and system administrators.\r\n\r\nThis tool performs a security audit of the system and determines how well it is hardened. Any detected security issues will be provided in the form of a suggestion or warning at the end of the audit. Beside security related information it will also scan for general system information, installed packages and possible configuration errors.\r\n\r\nThis software aims in assisting automated auditing, hardening, software patch management, vulnerability and malware scanning of Unix/Linux based systems. It can be run without prior installation, so inclusion on read only storage is possible (USB stick, cd/dvd).\r\n\r\nLynis assists auditors in performing Basel II, GLBA, HIPAA, PCI DSS and SOx (Sarbanes-Oxley) compliance audits, by automation of control testing.\r\n\r\nExtended support for companies is available.", "shortname": "lynis", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@cisofy_is", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/cisofy", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "System/security auditing tool for hardening and securing Linux/Unix", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 258466}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lynis/", "video_url": null}
