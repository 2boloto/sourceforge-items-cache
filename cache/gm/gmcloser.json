Unlike other gap-closing tools that use only NGS reads, GMcloser uses preassembled contig sets or long read sets as the sequences to close gaps and uses paired-end (PE) reads and a likelihood-based algorithm to improve the accuracy and efficiency of gap closure. The efficiency of gap closure can be increased by successive treatments with different contig sets.\r\n\r\nAn accompanied package, GMvalue, is a tool to determine misassembly sites in contigs and scaffolds. Unlike other related tools, GMvalue can define misassembly categories with several options, and can be applied to assemblies of a large size genome. By using the -e option, GMvalue also generates error-free assemblies by splitting or correcting misassembles.", "shortname": "gmcloser", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Closing the gaps in scaffolds with preassembled contigs", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2003646}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gmcloser/", "video_url": null}
