Unlike other gap-closing tools that use only NGS reads, GMcloser uses preassembled contig sets or long read sets as the sequences to close gaps and uses paired-end (PE) reads and a likelihood-based algorithm to improve the accuracy and efficiency of gap closure. The efficiency of gap closure can be increased by successive treatments with different contig sets.\r\n\r\nAn accompanied package, GMvalue, is a tool to determine misassembly sites in contigs and scaffolds. Unlike other related tools, GMvalue can define misassembly categories with several options, and can be applied to assemblies of a large size genome. By using the -e option, GMvalue also generates error-free assemblies by splitting or correcting misassembles.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gmcloser", "_id": "52805ff63e5e83294cf187f1", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2003646, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Closing the gaps in scaffolds with preassembled contigs", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
