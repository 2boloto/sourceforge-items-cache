For the odd case where you have to create test data and instantiate java objects from the source code that is being tested you may have to have some test data populated using arbitrary values or perhaps sensible values into your objects. When the number of these objects increases and if the number of fields in them increases then creating test data is usually a task in itself. \r\nThe aim of this project is to provide an API that can be reused and produce such data within your defined constraints.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "typebuilder", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/userid-2208884/", "username": "chris_mario", "name": "christo_mario2000"}], "external_homepage": null}
