While your server agents will repopulate most of the data, there is no easy way to export and import your Administrative (or custom) data. This can be a deal-breaker for anyone who has custom info for hundreds of servers.\r\n\r\nThis script allows you to do the following:\r\n\r\n-Dump all administrative data from your current database, storing the data in .csv files\r\n\r\n-Restore that data after rebuilding your OCS database (whether via a database restore, or by waiting for your clients to check in again.)\r\n\r\n-During the restore, you can see if any servers from the old instance are missing in the new instance, so that you won't have incomplete admin data.\r\n\r\nRequires a Linux-based OCS Inventory server v. 2.0+, and a mysql database.
