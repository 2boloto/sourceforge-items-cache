It has been used multiple times in live environments to bring an MVC framework into new section inside existing code or to clean up existing spaghetti code.", "shortname": "vandaphp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "moved", "summary": "A bare-bones MVC PHP framework", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 610872}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/vandaphp/", "video_url": null}
