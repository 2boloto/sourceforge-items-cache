It is almost entirely based on the CakePHP framework. The core of being able to split your code into models, views and controllers remains whilst removing all the CakePHP code that you may well already have versions of. \r\n\r\nIt is perfect to fit into existing code as at only around 80 lines of code it can be fitted in anywhere. It has been used multiple times in live environments to bring an MVC framework into new section inside existing code or to clean up existing spaghetti code.", "moved_to_url": "https://github.com/ianchanning/vandaphp", "shortname": "vandaphp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/icc97/", "username": "icc97", "name": "Ian Channing"}], "external_homepage": null}
