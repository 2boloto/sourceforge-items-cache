They also suck.  .NET does all the plumbing work for you, which is nice, but at the cost of flexibility and lots of overhead.  It also locks you into .NET on the client side unless you want to code all the SOAP/XML parsing yourself, which is a pain when you don't need it.  JLWebService is a simple web service framework that eliminates all the .NET junk and bulky SOAP/XML stuff you get with .NET web services.  It installs as an HTTP handler under IIS and does the kind of stuff .NET tries to do for you, only with a lot more flexibility and control, and a lot less overhead.  You have to do a little more of the work yourself, but you get the flexibility of writing your client-side code in any language you want, on any platform you want, and you have control over what gets sent over the network (no more sending a bazillion bytes of XML just to send a few bits of data, which is exactly what often happens with .NET web services).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jlwebservice", "_id": "52656950b9363c206b43f115", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1985651, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "A .NET web service framework without all the junk that comes with .NET", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
