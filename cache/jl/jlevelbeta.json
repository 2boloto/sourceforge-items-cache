Just import JLevel 2.0 and turn all the tag elements that you have ever known into simple method call.\r\n\r\nThe best is there for you to discover as JLevel not only stripped off tagging in Java html , it has formulated series of shortcuts by abstracting redundant html codes that we have often repeatedly written saving you valuable time.\r\nYou will no longer dread including html as a formatting tool in your java application when you use JLevel 2.0.\r\n\r\nAnother important feature that JLevel 2.0 has made possible inside java is the abilit", "shortname": "jlevelbeta", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "https://twitter.com/llevel1", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/JLevel4java", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Kogonuso JLevel - a simple java library that has changed the way html ", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "JLevel  - Code", "mount_point": "jlevelbeta", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1253600}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jlevelbeta/", "video_url": ""}
