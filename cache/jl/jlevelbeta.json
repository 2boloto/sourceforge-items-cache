It has automated all tagging operations of Html inside java, this means that you are no longer required to learn how to format html String when developing application that requires html in java or even when using Servlet technology to develop your websites. Just import JLevel 2.0 and turn all the tag elements that you have ever known into simple method call.\r\n\r\nThe best is there for you to discover as JLevel not only stripped off tagging in Java html , it has formulated series of shortcuts by abstracting redundant html codes that we have often repeatedly written saving you valuable time.\r\nYou will no longer dread including html as a formatting tool in your java application when you use JLevel 2.0.\r\n\r\nAnother important feature that JLevel 2.0 has made possible inside java is the abilit", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jlevelbeta", "_id": "5100cfb304161f3123119ba2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "jlevelbeta", "name": "git", "label": "JLevel  - Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1253600, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Kogonuso JLevel - a simple java library that has changed the way html ", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: JDBC", "shortname": "db_api_jdbc", "fullname": "JDBC", "id": 502}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
