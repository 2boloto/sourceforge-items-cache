Proteins interact with a wide variety of molecules and understanding of such complex interactions is essential to gain deeper knowledge of protein function. Shape complementarity is known to be important in determining protein-ligand interactions. Furthermore, these protein structural features have been shown to be useful in assisting medicinal chemists during lead discovery and optimization. We developed KVFinder, a highly versatile and easy-to-use tool for cavity prospection and spatial characterization. KVFinder is a geometry-based method that has an innovative customization of the search space. This feature provides the possibility of cavity segmentation, which alongside with the large set of customizable parameters, allows detailed cavity analyses. KVFinder is also user friendly, as it is available as a PyMOL plugin, or command-line version.", "shortname": "kvfinder", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Cavity Detection PyMOL plugin", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2193767}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kvfinder/", "video_url": null}
