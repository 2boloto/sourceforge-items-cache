Originated in summer 2007 as a collection of C compiled for Matlab (MEX) files and was eventually ported to a standalone C++ application with a GUI created in Qt.\r\n\r\nThis program takes atomic and magnetic force microscope (AFM/MFM) image pairs as input and uses threshold segmentation to identify magnetic nanodots by intensity in the AFM image. These are then used to assess the magnetic states of those dots in the MFM image\r\n\r\nAttribution: \"C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4\" by Blanchette and Summerfield was helpful in getting me started on the GUI.", "shortname": "surfnanodots", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Very basic computer vision program", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 678433}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/surfnanodots/", "video_url": ""}
