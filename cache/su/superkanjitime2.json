The kanji lists are taken from the textbook Nakama 2.\r\n\r\nIn this game, you must click on the appropriate kanji according to the pronunciation given to you. When a correct click is made, a sound plays and the kanji disappears. The goal is to make all the kanji disappear as fast as you can.\r\n\r\nYou can compete against yourself, classmates, or friends using a local leaderboard that shows how fast you've completed each level. You can also unlock achievement trophies that record various milestones from your Super Kanji Time II experiences.", "shortname": "superkanjitime2", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A time attack game for learning various kanji.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2202087}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/superkanjitime2/", "video_url": null}
