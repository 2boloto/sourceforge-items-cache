SUSHI Py is capable of reading a list of SUSHI services from a CSV file or a MySQL database, and it can likewise write the resulting COUNTER report to a CSV file or a MySQL database.\r\n\r\nSUSHI Py was developed because there is a notable lack of usable and well documented SUSHI harvesters. The few projects listed by NISO are several years old, appear abandoned, and are unnecessarily large. The goal of SUSHI Py is not just to be simple to use but also to be simple to understand. SUSHI Py is a proof of concept.\r\n\r\nSUSHI Py is for the following people:\r\n\r\n1. Librarians and other electronic resource managers who want to implement SUSHI without paying big bucks for a commercial ERM client.\r\n\r\n2. Librarians and electronic resource managers who want a clear and documented example of how SUSHI works so that they can build their own custom implementation.", "shortname": "sushipy", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A lightweight and open-source SUSHI library for Python.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 734710}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sushipy/", "video_url": ""}
