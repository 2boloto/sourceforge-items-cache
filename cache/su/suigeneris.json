Sui Generis scans files and folders, and organizes them into \"clusters\" of duplicate files.  You can then designate duplicates to move into a \"pen\" directory, from which you may delete them, archive them or whatever.  Sui Generis includes features to let you quickly select duplicates to put in the pen, as well as a way to preview files before you move them.  It also has a plug-in interface through which you can add preview tools for specific file types.  I hope it will be useful to you.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "suigeneris", "_id": "5482a55085540d3770bf4d36", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2374614, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "An easy-to-use tool to help you find and manage duplicate files", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
