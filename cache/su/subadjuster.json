So you decide to download some, but now they\u2019re not in sync! This is where Subtitle Adjuster comes in - with this program you can adjust the timing of said subtitles. This works by specifying one or two reference points, of which you know the correct timing, after which Subtitle Adjuster can automatically recalculate the rest, saving the result as a new subtitle file. So for example, if you wanted to bring the subtitles forward by 5s, you would pick just one reference point, subtract 5s from the original start time of that subtitle, and enter the result under the section \u2018Should Start At\u2019.
