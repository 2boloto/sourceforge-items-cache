It\u2019s version is experimental, but demonstrates a number of interesting features, that can be readily exploited to detect and act against web attacks. SuStorID can be coupled with modsecurity, the well known web application firewall, to gather training data and provide for real-time counteractions. So, SuStorID is a host-based Intrusion Detection System, and by means of modsecurity can access internal web server\u2019s data (i.e. http request/response fields) exactly as Apache does.", "shortname": "sustorid", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 661884}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sustorid/", "video_url": ""}
