At its core, it incorporates basic mechanisms for local and remote capturing and decapsulation of packets (CISCO ERSPAN and HP ERM are supported). It can be extended to support many types of packet-based traffic analysis by creating plug-ins and loading them in the main application. It includes many optimizations to ensure high performance traffic processing. Some of them are: multithreaded traffic processing; explicit thread pinning; configurable packet burst processing; support for PF_PACKET and PF_RING. It can be also used to inject the processed traffic to a TAP device or regular physical Ethernet interface. Its basic functuonalities make it a viable solution for preprocessing CISCO ERSPAN and HP ERM traffic which can be handed to some other application.\r\n\r\nRCDCap offers its own set of plug-ins for doing different types of traffic analysis. Notably, it has its own plug-in for analysing NDP, ARP, DHCP and DHCPv6 traffic.", "shortname": "rcdcap", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "RCDCap is a remote capture preprocessor", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 752151}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rcdcap/", "video_url": ""}
