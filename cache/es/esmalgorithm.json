We designed a simple exact subgraph matching (ESM) algorithm for dependency graphs using a backtracking approach. The total worst-case algorithm complexity is O(n^2 * k^n) where n is the number of vertices and k is the vertex degree. \r\n\r\nWe have demonstrated the successful usage of our algorithm in three biomedical relation and event extraction applications: BioNLP 2011 shared tasks on event extraction, Protein-Residue association detection and Protein-Protein interaction identification.\r\n\r\nThis Java implementation implements our ESM algorithm.
