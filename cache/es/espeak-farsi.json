It is utilised on Windows, Linux and Mac, and has been ported to Android as well. This project aims to use crowd-sourcing to improve the pronunciation of Farsi words in eSpeak. It has been created by Shadyar Khodayari. so that Farsi speakers who use eSpeak can help to develop and enhance its pronunciations (through fa_list and fa_rules). If eSpeak does not pronounce a word correctly, you can add it to the fa_dict through our interface, and it will be distributed in the next version.
