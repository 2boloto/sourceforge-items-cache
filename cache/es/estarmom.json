However, the current feedback systems in most of online marketplaces are too simplistic in the way they compute the feedback scores. To compensate for this computation weakness, the marketplace operators have to: (1) provide statistical data and an archive of comments/reviews along with the feedback score; (2) set a long list of rules and policies to impose on the marketplace participants, and resort to human intervention in conflict cases. Therefore, there is still space to improve these feedback systems to bring more convenience to the users. One approach is to make the computation part of a feedback system more robust against manipulations and attacks. EStarMom is a trust simulator tailor-made for this environment. It can be extended by plugging in more user behavior models, trust algorithms, and users' decision-making models.
