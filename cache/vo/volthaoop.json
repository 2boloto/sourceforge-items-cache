The accuracy is comparable to BWA-MEM and novoalign with speed faster than those aligner. Volt use mulththread mapper that enable optimized processing under multicore processor and Hadoop YARN environment. It use about 5GB of RAM to hold human reference and require additional 2-5GB to run. In Hadoop mode, Volt reads file from HDFS and write BAM file usng Hadoop-BAM api  where reads sorting is done using Hadoop in build function. With Pure Java architecture  Volt was directory integrated into Hadoop, so there is no\r\nIO bottleneck by using Hadoop streaming, nor additional setting for reads mapper is not necessary other than running Hadoop job. Currently, Volt support BAM format for output.
