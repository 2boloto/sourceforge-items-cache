It can also perform some Monte Carlo simulations of the periodogram.\r\n\r\nThe details of the theory are given in the following refereed paper:\r\nBaluev R.V., 2013, MNRAS, V. 431, P.1167-1179.\r\nThe version 1.0 uploaded here is the same package as the one that can be downloaded along with the above paper as \"Supporting information\".
