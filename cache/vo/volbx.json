Application calculate dynamically such handy values as quantiles, standard deviation, average and more for given sample.\r\n\r\nThis tool was originally created for real estate appraisal to give possibility, for people working in that area, to estimate past, current and future value of analysed properties. Project/start-up was dropped and decision about release of less specialized application was made. Most advanced and dedicated for real estates functionalities were cut but still some are quite useful.\r\n\r\nUsed QT 5.3.2, QWT 6.1.1, QuaZip 0.7, Boost 1.55.0, MinGW 4.8.2", "shortname": "volbx", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Graphical tool for data manipulation written in C++/QT.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2362450}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/volbx/", "video_url": null}
