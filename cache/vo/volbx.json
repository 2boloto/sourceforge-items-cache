User can load data, filter, select, visualize, export and more using few clicks. Volbx reads, along with inner application format, xlsx and ods spreadsheet files. User can save output stream as csv or xlsx and plots as png files.\r\nDynamic and interactive plots can be zoomed, moved, reset to initial state, quickly exported to clipboard and more. Application calculate dynamically such handy values as quantiles, standard deviation, average and more for given sample.\r\n\r\nThis tool was originally created for real estate appraisal to give possibility, for people working in that area, to estimate past, current and future value of analysed properties. Project/start-up was dropped and decision about release of less specialized application was made. Most advanced and dedicated for real estates functionalities were cut but still some are quite useful.\r\n\r\nUsed QT 5.3.2, QWT 6.1.1, QuaZip 0.7, Boost 1.55.0, MinGW 4.8.2", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "volbx", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/przurban/", "username": "przurban", "name": "P.
