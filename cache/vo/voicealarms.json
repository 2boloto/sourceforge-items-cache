Save and Load event lists.  All alarm sounds repeat until stopped.  Record yourself saying 'wake up you lazy bum' or 'hey dude, get up and walk the dog', then set alarms to play those voice messages on any given day/time. If you set the alarm as a date/time, the alarm will go off only once, on that date.  If you set the alarm as a time, the alarm will go off every day at that time.  The .wav recording code is MS Windows only, but the program can play any wave file that is usable in REBOL.
