Its prime objective is to enable video streaming as part of the realization of IoT with reduced overall ecological footprint, in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, while maintaining video fidelity as tradeoff with the energy and carbon footprints. The solution consists of a new novel architecture for IoM and a framework that comprises of compressive sensing based video encoding and communication protocols for green communication. IEEE 802.11 is enhanced for  new power saving functions to exploit it as the link layer providing high data rate at low power for  multimedia devices.
