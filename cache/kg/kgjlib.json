Internally NetSharedVariable uses a client-server configuration, but that complexity is hidden from the application code which simply needs to interact with an instance of NetSharedVariable.\r\n\r\nJavaDocs and Wiki coming soon!\r\n\r\nKGJlib is Public Domain so that it can be used in proprietary projects without needing attribution, but if you use it I would love to here from you.", "shortname": "kgjlib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Java library containing classes that I wrote and am happy to share.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1719566}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kgjlib/", "video_url": ""}
