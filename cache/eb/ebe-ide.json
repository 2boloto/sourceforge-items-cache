The target is beginning programmers learning a language.\r\n\r\nDebugging is supported through using gdb.  There is a gdb console showing all interaction with gdb and there is an text entry box allowing users to enter gdb commands.\r\n\r\nIt is simpler than most IDEs, requiring no projects.  There are tooltips and nearly every special keyboard shortcuts also exist in the menus.  Hopefully these features will assist people learning ebe.  \r\n\r\nThere are a few features targeting assembly language such as creation of user-defined variables based on addresses.", "shortname": "ebe-ide", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Easy beginner IDE for C/C++, Fortran and Assembly", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 660011}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ebe-ide/", "video_url": ""}
