The idea is that anything entered into the system can be shared at the time it is entered thus avoiding duplication of effort for users who need to inform others of what is going on via different communication channels including other Information Systems.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that others could take the code and adapt it for their own purposes but maintain the central concept of making everything in the system easily shareable.\r\n", "shortname": "ayeaye", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Expandable Information System based on Python, wxPython and MongoDB", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1236421}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ayeaye/", "video_url": ""}
