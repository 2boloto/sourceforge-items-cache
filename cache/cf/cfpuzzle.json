The task is based off of existing measures of CF, the Trail Making Task and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task and has been previously validated. \r\n\r\nThe application provided here allows researchers to create and administer multiple experiments. Response times and errors are exported to text files for analysis.  \r\n\r\nTwo versions are available for download, one with randomized presentation order (CF Puzzle-rand) and one with fixed presentation order (CF Puzzle-!rand).\r\n\r\nThe CF puzzle was developed by Dr. Robert Youmans and Christian Gonzalez and programmed in Adobe\u24c7 Flash\u24c7 by Dustin Rhodes.
