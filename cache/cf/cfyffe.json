If you want to reconfigure it for x86, feel free to, but I'm not going to as I only have x86_64 hardware.\r\n\r\nThis will never leave BETA status as it's usually total chaos about how releases are handled, features may appear and disappear faster than you can blink. The only thing I can promise about the kernels I upload is that if I upload it, it built, installed, and booted on my personal system without a problem.\r\n\r\nI use LUKS and LVM for everything but /boot, so I know they work when I upload the kernel.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll admit it, I'm a security freak, if I even think there MIGHT be a security hole, I don't rest until I've fixed it and verified it's been properly fixed, I also want my laptop to be as fast as possible, so in the end, you'll be getting a secure kernel that's about as fast as Linux can go on common home x86_64 PC hardware.
