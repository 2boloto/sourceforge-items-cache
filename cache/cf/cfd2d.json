The space discretization is based on Finite Element Method (FEM) using an approximately uniform triangular mesh. The two choices of FE spaces are offered, these are of the so called MINI-element and of the Taylor-Hood element. The first element consists of continuous piecewise linears with a cubic bubble function for the velocity field, and the second of continuous piecewise quadratics for the same. The pressure field is approximated via piecewise linears in both cases. Both stationary and time-dependent regimes supported. Elementary graphing tools are provided. GMRES and CG iterative algorithms are used for solving linear systems. Software \"Triangle\" is used for mesh generation.", "shortname": "cfd2d", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations solver in 2D domains", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 703256}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cfd2d/", "video_url": ""}
