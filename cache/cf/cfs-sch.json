This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems.  More information on the cFS can be found at http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov\r\n  \r\nThe SCH application provides a method of generating software bus messages at pre-determined timing intervals. This allows the system to operate in a Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) fashion with deterministic behavior. The TDM major frame is defined by the Major Time Synchronization Signal used by the \r\ncFE TIME Services (typically 1 Hz).  The Minor Frame timing (number of slots executed within each Major Frame) is also configurable.
