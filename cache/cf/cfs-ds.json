This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems.  More information on the cFS can be found at http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov\r\n  \r\nThe DS application is used for storing software bus messages in files. These files are generally stored on a storage device such as a solid state recorder but they could be stored on any file system. Another cFS application such as CFDP (CF) must be used in order to transfer the files created by DS from their onboard storage location to where they will be viewed and processed.\r\n\r\nDS requires use of the cFS application library.
