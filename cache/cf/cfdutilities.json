These utilities have accumulated during four decades or so of software development in the aerospace field.\r\n\r\nAll are written in Fortran 90 or FORTRAN 77 with potential reuse in mind.  The only exception is the C translations of a dozen or so numerics routines grouped as C_utilities.\r\n\r\nDavid Saunders and Robert Kennelly are the primary authors, but miscellaneous contributions by others are gratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\nSee 1-line summaries of the libraries and applications under the Files menu.  Each library folder also contains 1-line summaries of the grouped subroutines, while each application folder contains READMEs adapted from the main program headers.
