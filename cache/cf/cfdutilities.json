The only exception is the C translations of a dozen or so numerics routines grouped as C_utilities.\r\n\r\nDavid Saunders and Robert Kennelly are the primary authors, but miscellaneous contributions by others are gratefully acknowledged.\r\n\r\nSee 1-line summaries of the libraries and applications under the Files menu.  Each library folder also contains 1-line summaries of the grouped subroutines, while each application folder contains READMEs adapted from the main program headers.
