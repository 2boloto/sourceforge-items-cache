E-mail is handled through a REST request to their API, as opposed to standard SMTP protocols. It includes message identification, bounce back APIs and webhooks to track mail delivery.\r\n\r\nThis version features the capability to add file attachments to outgoing E-mail, including multiples. Mime-types are determined 'on the fly'. There is no limit to the number, type or size of attachments, other than those restrictions imposed by PostMarkApp.\r\n\r\nThis app extends earlier work by Jonathan Lane and Robert Rawlins, with thanks to Ben Nadel.\r\n\r\nFurther instructions and information are available in the header of the cfc.
