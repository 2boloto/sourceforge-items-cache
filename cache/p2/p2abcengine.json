These differences and the complexity of the cryptographic protocols hinder the deployment of these mechanisms for practical applications. In this policy engine, we bridge this gap and simplify the design and deployment of privacy-friendly authentication mechanisms. We unify the different concepts and features and define privacy-preserving attribute-based credentials (Privacy-ABCs) and provide a language framework in XML schema. Our language framework enables application developers to use Privacy-ABCs with their different features without having to consider the specific cryptographic algorithms under the hood, similarly as they do today for digital signatures, where they do not need to worry about the particulars of the RSA and DSA algorithms either.", "shortname": "p2abcengine", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Privacy-Preserving Attribute-Based Credential Engine", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1221839}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/p2abcengine/", "video_url": ""}
