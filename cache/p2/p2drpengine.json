I WANT a project devoted to D&D, AND Space Games, AND Platformers. I'm taking a D&D-BASED path, but putting my own knowledge and imagination into it. So, honestly, the quickest way to contribute is to make a SourceForge, directly message me and request for a Branch, and literally take the time to TACKLE issues as they're found. I'll be teaching some of my own peers to program through this, and if you feel inspired to do so, tell me, and I'll devote a Branch to your private team.", "shortname": "p2drpengine", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/AnthTheInformativeTechieGuru", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Java Client + JS/Canvas Server-Side System, with maintained Objects", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1848419}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/p2drpengine/", "video_url": ""}
