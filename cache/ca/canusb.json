This wrapper uses 'PInvoke' (like peek/poke) to 'martial' calls from managed to unmanaged code. It sounds complicated, and it is.\r\nIT IS ALSO TOTALLY UNNECESSARY. Why not have the DLL as managed code?? Why not simply reference the library in your project and just call its functions?? This project does just that\r\n\r\nLicence:\r\nLGPLV3.: In summary, the only thing we ask is if you  improve / bugfix / extend the library then feed these changes back into the project by emailing jon_newcomb or requesting sourceforge access.
