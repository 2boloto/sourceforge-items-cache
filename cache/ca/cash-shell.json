When I couldn't stop adding features to it and kept coming back for more, I decided to release it into the wild and let my fellow hackers and coders enjoy it, for better or for worse. I invite you to take it apart, break it, add to it, and anything else you might dream up.\r\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, this is not the best, or most professional code out there. Feel more than free to email me, send in a patch, or fork it and show me how it's done. I'll just be glad to learn more, and get more features into Cash.", "summary": "A shell for linux written in C", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 838722, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cash-shell", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/sav1or/", "username": "sav1or", "name": "savior"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "https://github.com/Saviorphoenix/Cash", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: System Shells", "fullname": "System Shells", "shortname": "shells", "id": 294}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}]}}
