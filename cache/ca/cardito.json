It does a simple recursive scan of all files in the specified directory and checks the condition of the found numbers to Luhn's algorithm. It does not require installation. It has to be placed locally on the machine which is to be scanned.\r\nCardito is small yet powerful. Currently, it supports the following file formats to be scanned: txt, csv, log, xml, htm, html, rtf. If you feel there is a need to add any more formats which you encounter, it is very simple to do so from the source. Also, you can raise a ticket for the same. If I feel there is an increasing demand for some file formats to be added to the executable, I'll sure compile it in the exe and release it.\r\nEnjoy using Cardito and drop your reviews good or bad. :)", "summary": "", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1100130, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cardito", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ameyanekar/", "username": "ameyanekar", "name": "Amey Anekar"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Perl", "fullname": "Perl", "shortname": "perl", "id": 176}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "id": 868}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "fullname": "Security", "shortname": "security", "id": 43}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Auditors", "fullname": "Auditors", "shortname": "auditors", "id": 864}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "id": 866}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}]}}
