It boosts self-esteem to win.\r\n2. it\u2019s more fun to play Chess without being forced to think too much.\r\n3. Cassette Chess can make you a better chess player because it allows for rapid chess strategy experimentation.\r\n\r\nMost chess games include a Grandmaster level CPU opponent, and this usually frustrates players and turns them away from learning and enjoying chess.  On the contrary, in Cassette Chess your opponents rank is \"Featherweight's Apprentice\"  i.e. \"Noob\".  You'll be delighted how easily you can rack up your opponents pieces and even do victory laps.\r\n\r\nCassette Chess is aimed at both novices and expert players.  Novices can use it to get a good sense of chess without thinking too much.  Expert players can use Cassette Chess to quickly experiment with different chess strategies.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cassette-chess", "_id": "52a85ecec4d10432d6750448", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2042800, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Cassette Chess is designed for rapid chess strategy experimentation.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Board Games", "shortname": "boardgames", "fullname": "Board Games", "id": 287}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Turn Based Strategy", "shortname": "turnbasedstrategy", "fullname": "Turn Based Strategy", "id": 83}], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
