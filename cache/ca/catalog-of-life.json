This extends the use of the gedcom format for use in Systematics or species categorization. \r\n\r\nThis move is inspired by a, belief that speciation can result from hybridization and may in fact be its primary driver instead of the accumulation of mutations. The accumulation of mutations may instead be responsible for a theoretical \"maturation\" of species which may have real physical meaning rather than being an amorphous concept which it might at first seem to be.\r\n\r\nSuch a view is not entirely out of left field as a slow consensus is possibly developing that something like this may be going on.  Scientists such as Donald Williamson and Lynn Margulis before she died, might regarded as pioneers in this way of thinking.\r\n\r\nThis tool is used to develop the data at http://genealogyoflife.com/.", "summary": "MS Access database converts the Catalogue of Life into a gedcom format", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 309574, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "donate", "name": "link", "label": "Donate"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "catalog-of-life", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/socrtwo22/", "username": "socrtwo22", "name": "socrtwo22"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://godskingsandheroes.info/software/#catalog_of_life_converter", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "id": 230}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)", "fullname": "Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)", "shortname": "visualbasicforapplications", "id": 838}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: Microsoft Access", "fullname": "Microsoft Access", "shortname": "db_msaccess", "id": 518}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "id": 252}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Social sciences :: Genealogy", "fullname": "Genealogy", "shortname": "Genealogy", "id": 284}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Library :: Research", "fullname": "Research", "shortname": "research", "id": 819}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}]}}
