This extends the use of the gedcom format for use in Systematics or species categorization. \r\n\r\nThis move is inspired by a, belief that speciation can result from hybridization and may in fact be its primary driver instead of the accumulation of mutations. The accumulation of mutations may instead be responsible for a theoretical \"maturation\" of species which may have real physical meaning rather than being an amorphous concept which it might at first seem to be.\r\n\r\nSuch a view is not entirely out of left field as a slow consensus is possibly developing that something like this may be going on.
