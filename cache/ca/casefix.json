Also, there are 3 functions that interface char arrays and strings to the streaming editors. So the library can modify the casing of any character, character block (word), any character string, character array, or any character stream. Currently, libcasefix only handles 7 or 8 bit character sets with some support for UTF-8. With that in mind casefix does support a number of character sets for internationalization. Also, there is a casefix command that implements  the functionality of the casefix library for use at the command line.", "summary": "a small set of casing tools for use by all", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1274433, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "casefix", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/cibolajerry/", "username": "cibolajerry", "name": "Jerry Brandenberger"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://casefix.yolasite.com/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "fullname": "BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 187}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Text Editors", "fullname": "Text Editors", "shortname": "editors", "id": 63}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "id": 253}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "id": 770}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: NetBSD", "fullname": "NetBSD", "shortname": "netbsd", "id": 204}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "fullname": "OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Win98 :: Win98 OSR2", "fullname": "Win98 OSR2", "shortname": "mswin_98_osr2", "id": 425}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Other", "fullname": "Other", "shortname": "other", "id": 212}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}]}}
