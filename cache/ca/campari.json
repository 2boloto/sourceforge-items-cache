This version adds many algorithms and features developed and used in recent published work. We would like to highlight in particular the extensions to the data analysis facility (clustering and network-based analysis) and the availability of unusual restraint potentials (e.g., to secondary structure content, spatial density maps, or polymeric descriptors). It continues to support the ABSINTH force field paradigm and implicit solvation model.\r\n\r\nCAMPARI is a joint package for performing and analyzing molecular simulations, in particular of polymers of biological relevance. It focuses on a wide availability of algorithms for (advanced) sampling and is capable of combining Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics sampling in seamless fashion. CAMPARI offers the user a very high level of control over all implemented features.
