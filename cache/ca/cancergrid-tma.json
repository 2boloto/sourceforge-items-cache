The application enables the user to navigate a grid of TMA core images within a slide, zoom and pan around an image, and enter a score constrained to a specific scoring system. The submitted scores are scored in the eXist open source database, in an XML format, which is compatible with existing TMA standards, and thus allow the data to be archived and re-used in future analysis.", "summary": "A web-based application for the management of tissue microarray images", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 592076, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cancergrid-tma", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ljmorris/", "username": "ljmorris", "name": "Lorna Morris"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cancergrid-tma/screenshot/Picture%2013.png", "caption": "Heatmap view and scoring form", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cancergrid-tma/screenshot/Picture%2013.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: XML-based", "fullname": "XML-based", "shortname": "db_api_xml", "id": 507}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "id": 252}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Medical Science Apps.", "fullname": "Medical Science Apps.", "shortname": "medical", "id": 266}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
