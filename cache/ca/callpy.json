It is possible to call an octave function from python too. In fact callpy is made up by three scripts. The first script (which is an octave function) is written in octave language, and the second one is a python script. The third is another octave script responsible for the python \u2192 octave call. The octave scripts are called callpy.m and calloct.m and the python script is called callpy.py.\r\nThe callpy.m file implements the octave callpy function in the octave \u2192 python direction. This means that callpy.m implements the octave side of the interface between octave and python. The callpy.py file implements the python side of our interface between python and octave. And the calloct.m implements the python \u2192 octave direction call.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "callpy", "_id": "53d165a69095474c3cd66bca", "tools": [{"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2290280, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Implements a bridge between octave and python", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
