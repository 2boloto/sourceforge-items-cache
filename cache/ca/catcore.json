Simply speaking, it is a framework that will allow a program to \"look for\" add-in functionality at startup, and then allow that plug-in to cooperate with itself. \r\n\r\nCATCore (Component Architecture Toolkit, Corelib) is this and more. With CATCore you can load plugins that run in there own thread(Actor) and communicate with each other via messages. But also applications can forward messages to other applications. So plugsins loaded in one app can communicate with plugins running in another app.", "summary": "This is distributed plugin framework for Scala", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 623802, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "catcore", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rittermanj/", "username": "rittermanj", "name": "Joshua Ritterman"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://www.validus-labs.com/catcore", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Scala", "fullname": "Scala", "shortname": "scala", "id": 704}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "id": 16}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "id": 606}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
