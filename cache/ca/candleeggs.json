The idea is to let any user talk to or type into their device and without any knowledge of the physicality or design currently necessary to use their device fully, be able to do just that. This thing will try to follow the GNU toolchain model, using functions that are unique objects and can be glued together by the overriding system, as well as my knowledge of teaching and linguistics to provide a simple, enjoyable interface to allow chimps in a zoo to get what they want out of their devices. EVERYTHING SHOULD BE HIDDEN from the users. They just get what they want. If they want to learn programming, the system should provide that too. They should be able to do ANYTHING that can be done with a computer.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "candleeggs", "_id": "4fe152651be1ce1cd6000017", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 799823, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "provides a natural language interface to Python", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other Audience", "id": 5}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
