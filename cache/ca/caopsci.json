We have a special interest in understanding how collaborative scientific networks behave as well as on the structure, organization and dynamics of scientific knowledge. Our work also includes developing data mining software. Although we are primarily interested in complex social behavior regarding science, we are also very interested in working on complex systems in general.We believe that our project is important because we are committed to the promotion of open science and to open scientific collaboration. Our scientific and computational work are also political in that they intend to contribute to the development of a more open and democratic science by understanding, from a complex systems point of view, how sciences is done and by making of this project a case of openness.\r\n\r\nWe've moved to:\r\nhttps://github.com/CSB-IG/literature", "summary": "Software for studying scientific collective behavior towards Op|Sci", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1077232, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "https://github.com/CSB-IG/literature", "shortname": "caopsci", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rgarcia-herrera/", "username": "rgarcia-herrera", "name": "Rodrigo Garc\u00eda"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/victormfloresr/", "username": "victormfloresr", "name": "Victor Manuel Flores R\u00edos"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jmsiqueiros/", "username": "jmsiqueiros", "name": "JMSiqueiros"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/superbenja/", "username": "superbenja", "name": "R.
