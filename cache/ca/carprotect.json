This project simply use the car input as identification and activate or deactivate the petrol pomp.\r\n\r\nEvery time you enter the car, you simply press on 2 push-button of your car cabin to ensure you are the legitimate driver. In this order: key1, key2, key1.\r\nThe button can be anything: windows, radio control, light, warning, turn indicator, ... I think a good option is the steering wheel multi function command.\r\n\r\nIf you don't execute this combination of code after 30 seconds the car petrol pomp power supply will be stopped. This will stop the car and avoid the robber to go any further, forcing him to leave the car!\r\nThe horn or anything else can be activated through another output of the arduino after the initial delay of 30 seconds.
