In other words, there are no provisions for \u201cslow\u201d I/O cases.\r\n\r\nThe original motivation for this tree was a better backend for memory managers. \r\n\r\nHowever, the end result was a new sub-category of trees. The implementation giving here is just one implementation of the new tree sub-category, there can be others.\r\n\r\nIn any case, read the PDF: \u201cCapsule Trees - A Primer\u201d, before delving into the code.\r\n", "summary": " ", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1883245, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "capsule-tree", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/koby-m/", "username": "koby-m", "name": "koby"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "id": 15}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Algorithms", "fullname": "Algorithms", "shortname": "algorithms", "id": 620}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "id": 770}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
