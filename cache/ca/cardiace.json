The kit consisted of an instruction manual and a die-cut cardboard \"computer\".\r\n\r\nThe computer \"operated\" by means of pencil and sliding cards. Any arithmetic was done in the head of the person operating the computer. The computer operated in base 10 and had 100 memory cells which could hold signed numbers from \u00b10 to \u00b1999. It had an instruction set of 10 instructions which allowed CARDIAC to add, subtract, test, shift, input, output and jump.", "summary": "CARDboard Illustrative Aid to Computation (Simulator)", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 646320, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cardiace", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gudduarnav/", "username": "gudduarnav", "name": "Arnav Mukhopadhyay"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://arnavguddu.6te.net/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
