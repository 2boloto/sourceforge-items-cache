Therefore, the two applications are based on simple algorithms, which are, however, widely used in similar calculations, also in similar calculators available online.\r\n    \r\nThe program takes into account a number of factors to produce outcomes as close to actual results as possible. However, the calculations are based on mathematical algorithms and therefore results may differ from reality. Thus, the author is not responsible for the consequences of its use.\r\n\r\nDownload options:\r\n- complete application with all the source code as well as jar and exe files.\r\n- exe file only.\r\nTo run the project use Kalkulatory.jar or Kalkulatory.exe.\r\n\r\nSee wiki for a full project description in polish.", "shortname": "calculators", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A combination of a virtual breathalyzer and a calories calculator.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1224101}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/calculators/", "video_url": ""}
