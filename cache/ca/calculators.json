Therefore, the two applications are based on simple algorithms, which are, however, widely used in similar calculations, also in similar calculators available online.\r\n    \r\nThe program takes into account a number of factors to produce outcomes as close to actual results as possible. However, the calculations are based on mathematical algorithms and therefore results may differ from reality.
