We focus on testing nonlinear dependence/correlation of two continuous variables (X and Y). We address this problem by a framework named CANOVA (continuous analysis of variance). In the CANOVA framework, we first define a neighborhood of each data point according to its X value, and then calculate the variance of the Y value within the neighborhood, finally perform a permutation test for the significance of the observed within neighborhood variance. CANOVA is efficient in testing nonlinear correlation and has its own advantages in real data applications.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "canova", "_id": "54465ab39095471e3c88b304", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 2348618, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Efficient Test for Nonlinear Dependence of Two Continuous Variables", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
