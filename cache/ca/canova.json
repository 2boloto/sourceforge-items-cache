We focus on testing nonlinear dependence/correlation of two continuous variables (X and Y). We address this problem by a framework named CANOVA (continuous analysis of variance). In the CANOVA framework, we first define a neighborhood of each data point according to its X value, and then calculate the variance of the Y value within the neighborhood, finally perform a permutation test for the significance of the observed within neighborhood variance. CANOVA is efficient in testing nonlinear correlation and has its own advantages in real data applications.", "shortname": "canova", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Efficient Test for Nonlinear Dependence of Two Continuous Variables", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2348618}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/canova/", "video_url": null}
