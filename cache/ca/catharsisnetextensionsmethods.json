It can significantly speedup your daily .NET development tasks, relieving you of writing boilerplate code time and again. Do more by writing less code; write less code using a popular fluent-kind interface approach; safely perform many tasks in a single line of code with joined methods calls.\r\n\r\nThis library is extensively unit-tested, greatly reducing the possibility of bugs and quirks.\r\n\r\nPurpose : Provide extension methods for common .NET types and common domain classes to simplify and speedup typical .NET business applications development process.\r\n\r\nTarget : .NET Framework 3.5/3.5 Client Profile/4.0/Silverlight 5\r\n\r\nNuGet package : https://www.nuget.org/packages/Catharsis.Commons", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "catharsisnetextensionsmethods", "_id": "5347ed2cbcf63a4e0093d067", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2190389, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}], "summary": "Library of extensions for many common .NET types.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "id": 606}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
