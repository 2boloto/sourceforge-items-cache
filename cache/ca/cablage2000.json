It shows a graphical representation of a logic scheme with wires connecting logic modules which have specific parameters. This software has been developped for NIM/TTL logic, thus his simplicity allows also the representation of other logic systems, numeric systems or analogic systems i.e. the pedal board of an electric guitar.\r\n\r\nThe Secret of NIM is divided in two parts. The first one is the main part of the software. It edit different project, connect modules with wires and edit the parameters of those modules. The other part of the sofware is an utility. It edits the modules which will be used for the projects or create them if they aren't in the database yet.\r\n\r\nThe Secret of NIM is a all-in-one software, easy to use and very helpful for saving the wiring of an experiment. But it can't do the logic itseft, it allows only a visualisation of the logic.", "shortname": "cablage2000", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An easy way to remerber NIM logic", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2067710}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cablage2000/", "video_url": null}
