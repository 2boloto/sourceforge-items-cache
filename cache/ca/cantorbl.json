Optics is made of two lenses, and provides oncomers-friendly (though still somewhat blinding), near-&-middle-distance (0-10m) light for slow riding in parks and sidewalks. Lenses are shifted relative to LEDs to improve a bit the light distribution. Simulations (including 3D) of beams in octave enable comparison of this light with many other lights. Driver is linear, using AMC7135 and Atmel AVR ATtiny45, Li-Ion battery powered. The firmware provides convenient control - bikelight-specific. For housings a modified common \"Magic-shine\"-type headlight (Xeccon-S14T) was used, and also \u041c25-housing from easy2led-dot-com. Complementary (also DIY) brake light also has lens optics, and is based on the same driver.", "shortname": "cantorbl", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Cantor is a set of ideas for building a quality home-made bike light", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2234028}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cantorbl/", "video_url": null}
