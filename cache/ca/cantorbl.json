Optics is made of two lenses, and provides oncomers-friendly (though still somewhat blinding), near-&-middle-distance (0-10m) light for slow riding in parks and sidewalks. Lenses are shifted relative to LEDs to improve a bit the light distribution. Simulations (including 3D) of beams in octave enable comparison of this light with many other lights. Driver is linear, using AMC7135 and Atmel AVR ATtiny45, Li-Ion battery powered. The firmware provides convenient control - bikelight-specific. For housings a modified common \"Magic-shine\"-type headlight (Xeccon-S14T) was used, and also \u041c25-housing from easy2led-dot-com. Complementary (also DIY) brake light also has lens optics, and is based on the same driver.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cantorbl", "_id": "537cfaabd46bb4600e2d0bcf", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2234028, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Cantor is a set of ideas for building a quality home-made bike light", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Hobbies", "shortname": "hobbies", "fullname": "Hobbies", "id": 772}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
