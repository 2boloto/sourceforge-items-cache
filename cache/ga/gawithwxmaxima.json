The functions called by the operators allowed rational parametric coefficients for the bases in a multivector (or in any vector).\r\n\r\nWorked examples were taken from a reference book...Linear and Geometric Algebra (LAGA) and also from ...Vector and Geometric Calculus (VAGC). Each valid example helped to validate the GAwxM syntax.\r\n\r\nWork has now ceased on a Windows version and the obsolete code has been removed.
