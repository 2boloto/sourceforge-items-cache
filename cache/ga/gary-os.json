The file is generated using a customized Funtoo/Gentoo configuration with a default Grml Linux kernel configuration via the Metro automated build tool.\r\n\r\nThere are currently no major projects which take this same approach on this scale.  The result is a smaller boot/rescue file that is just as comprehensive, yet easier to deploy and manage.\r\n\r\nGaryOS enables you to drop a single file on any media, point a bootloader at it and go.  Upgrades are as simple as replacing the file and/or adding another bootloader entry.\r\n\r\nRescue media is more likely to be available and up-to-date if it is convenient to deploy and manage, which is one of the primary aims of GaryOS.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gary-os", "_id": "530ff2dd85540d167b55e205", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2117857, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "GaryOS is an entire GNU/Linux system in a single bootable file", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "id": 253}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: OS distribution", "shortname": "osdistro", "fullname": "OS distribution", "id": 798}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: OS distribution :: Live CD", "shortname": "livecd", "fullname": "Live CD", "id": 799}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Unix Shell", "shortname": "shell", "fullname": "Unix Shell", "id": 185}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: X Window System (X11)", "shortname": "x11", "fullname": "X Window System (X11)", "id": 229}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "id": 537}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "id": 866}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: Project is an Operating System Distribution", "shortname": "os_projectdistro", "fullname": "Project is an Operating System Distribution", "id": 438}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: Project is an Operating System Kernel", "shortname": "os_projectkernel", "fullname": "Project is an Operating System Kernel", "id": 437}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Virtualization", "shortname": "virtualization", "fullname": "Virtualization", "id": 664}]}}
