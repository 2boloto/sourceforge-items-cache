The file is generated using a customized Funtoo/Gentoo configuration with a default Grml Linux kernel configuration via the Metro automated build tool.\r\n\r\nThere are currently no major projects which take this same approach on this scale.  The result is a smaller boot/rescue file that is just as comprehensive, yet easier to deploy and manage.\r\n\r\nGaryOS enables you to drop a single file on any media, point a bootloader at it and go.  Upgrades are as simple as replacing the file and/or adding another bootloader entry.\r\n\r\nRescue media is more likely to be available and up-to-date if it is convenient to deploy and manage, which is one of the primary aims of GaryOS.", "shortname": "gary-os", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "GaryOS is an entire GNU/Linux system in a single bootable file", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2117857}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gary-os/", "video_url": null}
