Download, extract wherever you want, launch the executable and read the instructions that are conveniently placed in the main window of the program.\r\n\r\nThis program allows gamers to fake their ping and packet loss. Only games which allow direct IP connections are supported - this program will not emulate the game server and will not advertise itself on any master server of any game.\r\n\r\nThe idea is this:\r\ngame client -> proxy -> game server\r\n\r\nDemonstration video:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/2VWNhmfD1Qk", "shortname": "gamersproxy", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Proxy for games that emulates network conditions like ping and lag.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 922520}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gamersproxy/", "video_url": ""}
