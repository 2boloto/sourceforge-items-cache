This allows free rotation of the sphere, avoiding the distortions of Aitoff and other projections often used. It is a very practical way to view and prepare skymap plots of GALPROP output.\r\nGALPROP outputs a spectrum per HealPix pixel, while Aladin requires each energy to be stored as a column. A conversion is required to make GALPROP skymaps viewable in Aladin.\r\nThis program performs this conversion, outputs both the original energy bins and energy-integrated spectra, and in addition convolves with a user-defined Gaussian both in energy bins  and energy-integrated. Also outputs the spherical harmonic decomposition as HealPix, per energy bin. There is also an option to divide by a second HealPix file, for example to give intensity if file 1 is counts and file 2 is exposure, to give intensity.\r\nNow also converts back.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "galpropskymapco", "_id": "51010f1b7929e554666b469c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1253913, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Convert galprop skymaps to standard healpix", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Astronomy", "shortname": "astronomy", "fullname": "Astronomy", "id": 134}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
