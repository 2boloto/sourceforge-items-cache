This allows free rotation of the sphere, avoiding the distortions of Aitoff and other projections often used. It is a very practical way to view and prepare skymap plots of GALPROP output.\r\nGALPROP outputs a spectrum per HealPix pixel, while Aladin requires each energy to be stored as a column. A conversion is required to make GALPROP skymaps viewable in Aladin.\r\nThis program performs this conversion, outputs both the original energy bins and energy-integrated spectra, and in addition convolves with a user-defined Gaussian both in energy bins  and energy-integrated. Also outputs the spherical harmonic decomposition as HealPix, per energy bin. There is also an option to divide by a second HealPix file, for example to give intensity if file 1 is counts and file 2 is exposure, to give intensity.\r\nNow also converts back.\r\n", "shortname": "galpropskymapco", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Convert galprop skymaps to standard healpix", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1253913}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/galpropskymapco/", "video_url": ""}
