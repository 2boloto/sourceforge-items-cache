It is the product of two lines of research: simulation languages based on Zeigler's theory of simulation and logic-based agents. There is, in GALATEA, a proposal to integrate, in the same simulation platform, conceptual and concrete tools for multi-agent, distributed, interactive, continuous and discrete event simulation. \r\n\r\nGALATEA is also a direct descendent of GLIDER, a DEVS-based simulation language which incorporates tools for continuous modelling as well.
