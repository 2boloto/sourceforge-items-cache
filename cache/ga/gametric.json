Furthermore, -1 universal time-unit is the maximum allowed time-travel for the quantum-level.\r\nThe universal time-unit represents the CPU power of approx. 171.7Ghz - 180Ghz which is based on the quantum mechanics of a time-travel. Today, we can only approximate such a device, and this algorithm does such a task telling us how many time-units one String needs to evolve into another representing a different approach to String Metrics.
