GammaLib is also wrapped into a Python module.\r\n\r\nGammaLib does not rely on any third-party software, except of HEASARC's cfitsio library that is used to implement the FITS interface. Large parts of the code treat gamma-ray observations in an abstract representation, and do neither depend on the characteristics of the employed instrument, nor on the particular formats in which data and instrument response functions are delivered. Instrument specific aspects are implemented as isolated and well defined modules that interact with the rest of the library through a common interface. This philosophy also enables the joint analysis of data from different instruments, providing a framework that allows for consistent broad-band spectral fitting or imaging.\r\n", "shortname": "gammalib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@gammalib", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Toolbox for high-level analysis of astronomical gamma-ray data", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 282143}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gammalib/", "video_url": ""}
