It will be comprised of various high level scheduling mechanisms and the optimum mechanism will be\r\nselected dynamically and fully automatically based on the state of each node or cluster in the distributed environment. This means the balancing of the input load will not be decided by a centralized and a predefined rule set, but rather by the collaborative decisions gathered from each distributed entity.\r\n\r\nThis framework is equipped with a system monitoring tool that\r\nvisualizes the behavior of the application in action and a simulating tool to test the performance before integrating it to the real world system.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gajaba", "_id": "4f3c9e960594ca3e1700017f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 698043, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Gajaba is a rule based dyanamic load balancing framework.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
