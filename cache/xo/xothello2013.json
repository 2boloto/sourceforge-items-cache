It has some strategies like corner preference, corner protection, sides preference, chance skipping preference etc. implemented and looks ahead upto 4 levels.\r\n\r\nI had first written this game 13 years ago in Turbo C for one contest, which I went on to win, and my mom had liked it very much and would play it a lot. In 2004, I lost it when my hard disk crashed. I tried downloading different versions of Othello but none of them marked the valid squares which the player could play and my Mom found locating valid squares very cumbersome. She would say she felt lost at every move. Also, she couldn't understand where the computer had played and which marbles it had captured. So I re-wrote it last year and now she's happy again. Thought of uploading it here so that everyone can enjoy it.\r\n\r\nDo read the README file to get started.\r\nIf 'qmake' in the README doesn't work, try 'qmake-qt4' instead.", "shortname": "xothello2013", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Othello's game written in C++ on Linux using Qt.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1494762}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/xothello2013/", "video_url": ""}
