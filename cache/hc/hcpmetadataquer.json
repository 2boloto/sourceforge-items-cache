It is restricted to operation-based queries, which reflect the creation and deletion of objects within HCP. It generates a list of objects within HCP as a whole, for a single Tenant, some Namespaces or even subdirectories whithin a Namespace.\r\n\r\nResult is a file in CSV-format or a SQlite3 database file for easier analysis.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it delivers a directory tree summarizing the number of files and subdirectories for each directory. The result is provided as a file in JSON-format ('selected name'.tree) to be easily evaluated using standard scripting languages (Java, Perl, Python to name a few); it's human-readable, also.\r\n \r\nYou'll need to have either an administrative account with the Search role assigned or an user with the Search role for the namespaces to be queried. MAPI access isn't required.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hcpmetadataquer", "_id": "5049954c1be1ce1f2a346a86", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 887463, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Query HCP for objects based on operations (create, delete, ...)", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving", "shortname": "archiving", "fullname": "Archiving", "id": 19}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Formats and Protocols :: Data Formats :: Comma-separated values (CSV)", "shortname": "CSV", "fullname": "Comma-separated values (CSV)", "id": 769}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Logging :: Log Analysis", "shortname": "loganalysis", "fullname": "Log Analysis", "id": 861}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: Python Database API", "shortname": "db_python", "fullname": "Python Database API", "id": 506}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: SQLite", "shortname": "db_net_sqlite", "fullname": "SQLite", "id": 531}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "fullname": "Qt", "id": 479}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Auditors", "shortname": "auditors", "fullname": "Auditors", "id": 864}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
