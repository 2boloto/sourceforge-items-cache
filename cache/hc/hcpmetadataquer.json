The result is provided as a file in JSON-format ('selected name'.tree) to be easily evaluated using standard scripting languages (Java, Perl, Python to name a few); it's human-readable, also.\r\n \r\nYou'll need to have either an administrative account with the Search role assigned or an user with the Search role for the namespaces to be queried.
