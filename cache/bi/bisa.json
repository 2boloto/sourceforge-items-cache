Analysis results can be restricted to a chromosome; the minimum base pair overlap in two sets or maximum distance between regions can be set; as can the maximum allowed distance between region centres. BiSA is capable of reporting overlapping regions that share common base pairs; regions that are nearby; regions that are not overlapping; average region sizes. BiSA can also annotate binding regions of interest with nearby genes. The results of overlap analysis can be imported into the Knowledge Base, allowing them to go into downstream analysis and independent annotation. A Venn diagram tool is also integrated into the software to allow users to visualize overlap results.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bisa", "_id": "51694656c431432dbd9d5933", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1553175, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Genomic Region Archiving and Binding Sites Analysis (BiSA)", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Other network-based DBMS", "shortname": "db_net_other", "fullname": "Other network-based DBMS", "id": 533}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "fullname": "SQL-based", "id": 508}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Microsoft SQL Server", "shortname": "db_net_mssql", "fullname": "Microsoft SQL Server", "id": 530}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: ADO.NET", "shortname": "adonet", "fullname": "ADO.NET", "id": 835}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Healthcare Industry", "shortname": "healthcareindustry", "fullname": "Healthcare Industry", "id": 362}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Apple Mac OS Classic", "shortname": "macos9", "fullname": "Apple Mac OS Classic", "id": 311}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
