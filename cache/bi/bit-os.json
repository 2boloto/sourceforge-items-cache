Based on the ever pupular Linux Mint with a slightly darker theme, and builtin Bitcoin goodies.\r\n\r\nSo all your friends ever talk about is Bit OS. How do you get your hands on it? Just download and install, it's free. Easy. Run Live from USB, Upgrade from Ubuntu, or install along side Windows. \r\n\r\nGreat I have bitcoin and devcoin wallets, now, how do I fill them with coin? Bit OS has a built in mining screensaver to earn you coin while your computer sleeps. Kickback and watch your coin value skyrocket.  \r\n\r\nWant more Bitcoins? You could apply for an account on Mt. Gox and do an international wire transfer but who needs the headache. Look around your appartment. What a bunch of junk. Just put some stuff up on Craig's List to trade for Bitcoins. \r\n\r\nNow you've been bit. Spread the epedemic.\r\n\r\nDonate! \r\n\r\nBitCoin:\r\n12yBwyDJHABCvohdT8qBTeMJEYDqpXnVYV\r\n\r\nUnob:\r\nufPeusFC7oqDHfCnT5aBBK7U76nQTXxG2x", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bit-os", "_id": "51f9b5c181b24b78ec086d95", "tools": [{"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1921402, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Linux Distro codenamed Dark Penguin, Bit as in Bitcoin or Vampire Bite", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: Project is an Operating System Distribution", "shortname": "os_projectdistro", "fullname": "Project is an Operating System Distribution", "id": 438}]}}
