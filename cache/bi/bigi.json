The 3 main libraries are BI (Big Integer), Dec (Big Decimal), and Fract (Big Fraction).  These libraries are written in c++/cli and can handle a value of any amount of digits.  All the basic math (+-*/%Pow and ModPow) as well as equivalence are handled internally in Assembly language.  There is also a math library for handling the trig, log, hyperbolic functions and such.\r\n\r\n  I am starting this project here in the hopes of getting some help.  The bulk of the project is in managed c++, but would like to convert to native c++ and just have managed to work with other managed languages.  I am also looking to create complex versions of the Dec and Fract classes.  The Assembly language routines are working correctly, and Ive been able to get satisfactory response times, however, this is with my own memory management implementation.  Interested?  send me an email.  Ill post source code shortly.", "summary": "BigI is a collection of Big Number libraries", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1164177, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bigi", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/akrichard/", "username": "akrichard", "name": "Richard"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
