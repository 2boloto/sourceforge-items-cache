This Program allows you to keep track of all your friends birthdays as well as send them customized birthday messages anytime. It also automatically alerts you of any upcoming birthdays. It also comes with an extension to allow you to keep track of events without having to go online. The only time you need to be online is when you want to send a customized message. It also has message templates to make you sound cute and adorable or wild or humorous. Join me in this simple yet fun program to develop.
