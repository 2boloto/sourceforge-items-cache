The base learning algorithm is random forest which is involved in the process of determining which features are removed at each step. The algorithm starts with the entire set of features in the dataset. At every iteration, the number of the attributes is reduced by removing those attributes  which have zero importance value. After discarding those genes, a new random forest is built again with the selected set of genes that yields the smallest out-of-bag (OOB) error rate", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "birf", "_id": "51c94c6f1be1ce21a05a38a8", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1885215, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "A Balanced Iterative Random Forest For Gene Selection From Microarray ", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
