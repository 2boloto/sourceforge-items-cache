Speaking biologically, a typical DNA/RNA sequence consist of nucleotides while a protein sequence consist of amino acids.\r\n\r\n In this project  we aim to perform local sequence alignment between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences and find out structural or functional similarity. User can enter multiple DNA sequences. The given sequences are aligned by Sequence Alignment methodology - arranging sequences of DNA, RNA, protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences. The sequence Alignment is done by using The Smith-waterman algorithm  - a general local alignment method also based on dynamic programming.   In this project user has an option to save sequence in either of these formats. FASTA format or CLUSTAL format.Medical Fields can make use of this application  .", "shortname": "biosequencealig", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1888091}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/biosequencealig/", "video_url": ""}
