It does this currently by using a byte-wise look up table to build frequency data. The look up table is the result of XORing the input byte with either 170 (10101010) or 195 (11000011), outputting the lengths of consecutive 0s and 1s, maximizing the quantity of 1s per byte. This series of lengths is then reduced further, alternating between quantity of consecutive 1s and lengths that were already greater than 1. These numbers are then used as frequency data to build a Huffman tree, and then written to a temp file as their Huffman coded equivalents. This process is then repeated as many times as desired to achieve a further compressed file.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "binaryheuristic", "_id": "51cd70b4485acd7d1eeb7de2", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1887585, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "A recursive, binary level, Huffman coding compressor", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
