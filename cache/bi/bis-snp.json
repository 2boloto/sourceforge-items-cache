It uses bayesian inference with either manually specified or automatically estimated methylation probabilities of different cytosine context(not only CpG, CHH, CHG in Bisulfite-seq, but also GCH et.al. in other bisulfite treated sequencing) to determine genotypes and methylation levels simultaneously. It works for both of single-end and paired-end reads.Specificity and sensitivity has been validate by Illumina IM SNP array. In default threshold (Phred scale score > 20), it could detect 92.21% heterozygous SNPs with 0.14% false positive rate (90.88% sensitivity in C/T SNPs with 0.16% false positive rate, 98.51% sensitivity in non C/T SNPs with 0.16% false positive rate). Cytosine calling is not only based on reference context, so it could detect non-reference cytosine context.", "shortname": "bis-snp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Bisulfite-seq/NOMe-seq SNPs & cytosine methylation caller", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 783152}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bis-snp/", "video_url": ""}
