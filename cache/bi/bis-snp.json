It uses bayesian inference with either manually specified or automatically estimated methylation probabilities of different cytosine context(not only CpG, CHH, CHG in Bisulfite-seq, but also GCH et.al. in other bisulfite treated sequencing) to determine genotypes and methylation levels simultaneously. It works for both of single-end and paired-end reads.Specificity and sensitivity has been validate by Illumina IM SNP array. In default threshold (Phred scale score > 20), it could detect 92.21% heterozygous SNPs with 0.14% false positive rate (90.88% sensitivity in C/T SNPs with 0.16% false positive rate, 98.51% sensitivity in non C/T SNPs with 0.16% false positive rate). Cytosine calling is not only based on reference context, so it could detect non-reference cytosine context.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bis-snp", "_id": "4fc6d1d4b9363c7eeb000076", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 783152, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Bisulfite-seq/NOMe-seq SNPs & cytosine methylation caller", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
