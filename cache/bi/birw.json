BiRW is a package designed for analysis and prediction of the phenome-genome associations. BiRW package contains a program for analysis of circular bigraphs (CBGs) and the bi-random walk (BiRW) algorithm to capture the CBG patterns in the networks for unveiling human and mouse phenome-genome association. The processed OMIM human disease phenotype-gene association network and MGI mouse phentoype-gene association network are also released together with the source code.", "summary": "Bi-random Walks for Phenome-Genome Association Prediction", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2275444, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "birw", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/compbio-cse/", "username": "compbio-cse", "name": "Kuang Lab @ UMN"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://birw.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "fullname": "MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "id": 626}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
