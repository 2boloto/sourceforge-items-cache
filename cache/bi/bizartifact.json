The artifact-centric approach to Business Process Management (BPM) is fundamentally data-centric, and process flexible which complements the conventional process-centric approaches to BPM, as embodied in BPMN and BPEL. The ArtiFact system provides an advanced, light-weight approach to specifying artifact-centric BPM applications, including their interoperation with REST- or WSDL-based services. The system includes a simple, \"direct\" UI for specifying ArtiFact models, an XML-based representation of those models, an engine for executing business processes according to those models, and a framework that enables multiple organizations to collaborate on a shared business process.\r\nThe ArtiFact v1.0 system is the first contribution into a community by IBM of its Siena, Barcelona, and ACSI technologies.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bizartifact", "_id": "51a35056485acd7d50015787", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1806046, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}], "summary": "Artifact-centric Business Process Management", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise", "shortname": "enterprise", "fullname": "Enterprise", "id": 576}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise :: Business Service Management", "shortname": "bsm", "fullname": "Business Service Management", "id": 673}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise :: Business Process Management", "shortname": "processmanagement", "fullname": "Business Process Management", "id": 748}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache License V2.0", "shortname": "apache2", "fullname": "Apache License V2.0", "id": 401}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
