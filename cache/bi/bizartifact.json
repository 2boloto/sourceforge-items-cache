The artifact-centric approach to Business Process Management (BPM) is fundamentally data-centric, and process flexible which complements the conventional process-centric approaches to BPM, as embodied in BPMN and BPEL. The ArtiFact system provides an advanced, light-weight approach to specifying artifact-centric BPM applications, including their interoperation with REST- or WSDL-based services. The system includes a simple, \"direct\" UI for specifying ArtiFact models, an XML-based representation of those models, an engine for executing business processes according to those models, and a framework that enables multiple organizations to collaborate on a shared business process.\r\nThe ArtiFact v1.0 system is the first contribution into a community by IBM of its Siena, Barcelona, and ACSI technologies.", "shortname": "bizartifact", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Artifact-centric Business Process Management", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1806046}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bizartifact/", "video_url": ""}
