For example, a PCI configuration address consists of segment-bus-device-function, where segment is 16 bits, bus is 8 bits, device is 5 bits, and function is 3 bits. You can view a PCI configuration address in this format by inputting 16.8.5.3 in the format window and seeing the results in hex in the results window.\r\n\r\nThere is also a built-in calculator with arithmetic and logic functions.
