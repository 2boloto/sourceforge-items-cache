It's an easy to learn language with simple syntax.\r\n\r\nBizarre is focused on new and experienced programmers alike. It's and ideal language to learn if you want to script an advanced program without too much confusion. A new programmer will be able to easily understand and write code in Bizarre.\r\n\r\nBizarre has a unique structure to it. It was made specifically to make sense. When a new programmer looks at say C code he most likely won't have a clue what he's looking at. On the other hand when a new programmer looks at Bizarre code he will likely understand most of the code that he is reading.", "shortname": "bizarre", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A dynamic programming language aimed at simplicity and speed...", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Repository", "mount_point": "bizarre", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 722932}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bizarre/", "video_url": ""}
