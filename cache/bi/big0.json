Data is extremely dynamic in nature and keeps on changing at a very high frequency. This project aims at computing the analytics of the used data space of the universe. Data would be collected from disks. Each computer that has a used disk can contribute to this analytical engine. A client component would sit on the client computer that assimilates used data and sends to the centralized system when the computer comes up after each boot. Users can get to see various types of analysis.\r\n\r\nAt present, I've thought about some usage of this kind of analytics, will write about them soon.\r\n\r\nI am actively seeking contributors to this idea.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "big0", "_id": "50f65cac0594ca59702c912c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1235212, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Count used data space of the universe.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
