While retaining the major functions of the original birgHPC, including automated computing cluster conversion and auto slots detection, the new version (birgHPCC) is capable of creating and configuring a compute unified device architecture (CUDA) computing cluster, hence the extra \u201cC\u201d in the name. In addition to the increase in image size (less than 2 gigabytes) and a new Linux base (previously Debian, now Ubuntu), CUDA-capable bioinformatics software programs, such as NAMD, HOOMD-blue, VMD, GPU-HMMER and GPU-BLAST, are pre-installed in birgHPCC, along with the CUDA driver, libraries and software development kit (SDK).
