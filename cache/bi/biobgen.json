By running \"Bio.B-Gen\" multiple times for different molecular species and spacial domains quite complex initial systems can be generated. After the system is generated and all the overlaps are resolved an short GROMACS simulation run (10-20 ps) is usually required to ensure proper relaxation of the system.", "summary": "Initial system (box) generator for biological molecular simulations", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2078743, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "biobgen", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rozmanov/", "username": "rozmanov", "name": "Dmitri Rozmanov"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
