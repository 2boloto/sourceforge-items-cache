The user enters a price at set intervals called the period. Two simple moving averages are generated. These two simple moving averages generate buy and sell signals. A price range the option is traded in is generated. And if the user enters a minimum bet and a percent paid a betting scale is generated. The user can use the price range and or the signals to place bets. The betting scale is optional but can help the user maintain her/his balance and recover losses. Directions are on the spreadsheet and in readme.txt and manual.

Pick a set interval to continually update spreadsheet.\r\n10 prices must be entered before data should be used off spreadsheet.\r\n", "summary": "Spreadsheet for trading binary options.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2282702, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}, {"mount_point": "mercurial", "name": "hg", "label": "Mercurial"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "binaryoptionstradingstation", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/lloydburris/", "username": "lloydburris", "name": "Lloyd Burris aka Reactor"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/binaryoptionstradingstation/screenshot/screenshot.png", "caption": "BOTS", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/binaryoptionstradingstation/screenshot/screenshot.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://binaryoptionstradingstation.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Financial :: Investment", "fullname": "Investment", "shortname": "investment", "id": 77}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "fullname": "Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "id": 5}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}]}}
