The user enters a price at set intervals called the period. Two simple moving averages are generated. These two simple moving averages generate buy and sell signals. A price range the option is traded in is generated. And if the user enters a minimum bet and a percent paid a betting scale is generated. The user can use the price range and or the signals to place bets. The betting scale is optional but can help the user maintain her/his balance and recover losses. Directions are on the spreadsheet and in readme.txt and manual.
