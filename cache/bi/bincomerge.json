It shows hexadecimal and raw ASCII data.\r\nBinCoMerge is seeking for common blocks from the bigger ones to the lower ones. It works by levels of minimum block sizes which are powers of 2. For example, with a file sizing between 16 KiB and 32 KiB, Bincomerge will firstly seek for all common blocks bigger than 16 KiB. Then, it will seek for all common bigger than 8 KiB, then 4KiB, 2KiB, 1024 Bytes...\r\nBecause it works by levels, BinCoMerge can show some results before it finishes.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bincomerge", "_id": "515bec0a2718463428e6e81c", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 246286, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "bug", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bug"}, {"mount_point": "improvements", "name": "tickets", "label": "Improvements"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Compare binary files in hexadecimal view", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Version Control", "shortname": "versioncontrol", "fullname": "Version Control", "id": 52}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Information Analysis", "shortname": "informationanalysis", "fullname": "Information Analysis", "id": 385}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Binary editors", "shortname": "bined", "fullname": "Binary editors", "id": 782}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: wxWidgets", "shortname": "ui_wxwidgets", "fullname": "wxWidgets", "id": 481}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
