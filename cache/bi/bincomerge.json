Then, it will seek for all common bigger than 8 KiB, then 4KiB, 2KiB, 1024 Bytes...\r\nBecause it works by levels, BinCoMerge can show some results before it finishes.\r\n", "shortname": "bincomerge", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Compare binary files in hexadecimal view", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 246286}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Bug", "mount_point": "bug", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Improvements", "mount_point": "improvements", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bincomerge/", "video_url": ""}
