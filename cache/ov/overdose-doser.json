It is coded in python with qt support giving it multiplatform compatbility.  It uses the ping command repeatedly on a multitude of threads to generate lag.  It is small and uses minimum cpu cycles.  In testing, it was able to maintain 360 kb/s of lag without maxing a single core.\r\n\r\nOverdose was designed to give users a slight advantage in action based multiplayer games.  BzFlag and Teeworlds for example.  With lag, the position of the player will appear to be slightly ahead of where the player actually is.  This slight discrepancy makes the user much harder to hit.", "shortname": "overdose-doser", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple Artificial Lag Generator", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1245620}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/overdose-doser/", "video_url": ""}
