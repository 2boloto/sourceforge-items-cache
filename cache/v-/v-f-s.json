Unlike most archive file formats, vfs is designed with two specific purposes in mind: To bundle and compress all of an application's resources in a single, smaller file as opposed to a mess of stray files and directories; and to provide incredibly fast access to those resources on demand. As such, vfs archives are designed to be made once and accessed an abundance of times, and are not designed to be edited or feature-rich like the more general, commonplace formats. It depends on LZ4 compression to bring file size down while allowing fast access.\r\n\r\nThe vfs.c file is both an archive reading library and an archive writing utility bundled into a single file, depending on how the file is compiled. Both the utility and the library are extremely simple to use, and are designed for speed and simplicity instead of having a large feature set.", "shortname": "v-f-s", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Small, fast archive generation and resource retrieval library.", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2359150}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/v-f-s/", "video_url": null}
