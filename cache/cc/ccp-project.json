Cobbler Crisp accomplishes this through its affordable price (0 dollars and cents), its user interface that is easy to use, and its functionality that does not place academic barriers. Examples of these barriers include: independence when transcribing Braille to Print, and the skills lost after a product is returned after a student borrows it from his/her school, and he/she has to go to a different school or a college setting.", "shortname": "ccp-project", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Affordable, easy-to-use, and portable Braille writer.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1195932}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ccp-project/", "video_url": ""}
