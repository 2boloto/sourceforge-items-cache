Its intended use compliments Windows Deployment Services (WDS). VHDs can be deployed via BitTorrent, multicast, or direct unicast. BITs deployment may be implemented in future releases. This system was developed to ease student computer lab management. It is a replacement for other imagecast products like Symantec Ghost (tm).  CCCLI is a functional system currently being used at Camosun College. Currently, it is roughly mid-to-late Alpha stage. It works, but it is site-specific, there is no installer, configuration and use is extremely technical, and the code-base needs a complete rewrite. Administration is via server-based PowerShell script. There is no GUI yet.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cccli", "_id": "4ec1c188b9363c62c200006a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 627661, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Computer lab cloning via virtual hard drives", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Other/Nonlisted Topic", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other/Nonlisted Topic", "id": 234}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Administration", "shortname": "edadministration", "fullname": "Administration", "id": 726}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Installation/Setup :: Unattended", "shortname": "unattended", "fullname": "Unattended", "id": 828}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
