Here, the NRZI signal which stems from the laser-pickup of a CD player is recorded directly, providing sort of a \"pit-land photo\" of the CD. The resulting image file, in turn, is demodulated and decoded in software, i.e. within a \"virtual CD player\". Auxiliary tools for data tracks are: dsec2iso, dsec2mpg.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the image extraction functionality requires a proprietary hardware interface in combination with a modified CD player. The associated open hardware project \"ccccd-HW\" can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccccd-hw/\r\n\r\nNote: Special restrictions apply.
