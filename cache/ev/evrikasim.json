Modules are libraries containing definitions of concepts that can be used in the simulation. By definitions we mean properties, actions, reactions, etc. Evrika is used for creating both simulations and modules, so you can build your own module of elements, \r\nthen use them to create virtual experiments and simulations. Also, you can make advanced calculations. Evrika is basically an executable that reads and interprets code, outputing result. Each new version will offer new possibilities to define your elements and use them, so it is important to always have the last release. Of course, Evrika is backward-compatible, cross platform and free to use. In the near future an advanced editor and viewer will be created, so you can better manage your code and view the results.", "shortname": "evrikasim", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Science simulator and advanced calculator based on modules", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1187368}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/evrikasim/", "video_url": ""}
