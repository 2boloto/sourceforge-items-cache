Currently focused on Pathfinder (as that's what I spend my time on), but intended to be game-agnostic for most functions. Network-centric with a user-defined central list server (with a default public list server) to find games and players or just chat/spectate.\r\n\r\nIntended to manage game assets (character sheets, effects, initiatives, automate rules, etc) with a print function so you're not bound to the application to play your game.\r\n\r\nPlugins planned include a 3D mappiing capability using the Unreal Engine and initiative/effect tracking. Plugins may be under a different license than the base application, depending on the plugin.\r\n\r\nevilrpg itself is going to be under the BSD license supporting Windows, Linux, and (hopefully) Mac. Support is also planned for Android, and possible IOS if the community supports it (code is portable).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "evilrpg", "_id": "53d2a27681b24b505f4b7e1c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2290874, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "plugin-based RPG manager in C++ and Qt5", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Role-Playing", "shortname": "rpg", "fullname": "Role-Playing", "id": 84}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Mobile", "shortname": "mobileapps", "fullname": "Mobile", "id": 688}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "fullname": "MySQL", "id": 524}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "fullname": "SQL-based", "id": 508}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "fullname": "Qt", "id": 479}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
