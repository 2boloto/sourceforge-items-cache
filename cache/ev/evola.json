Each creature runs as a separate process.

But its inventor is not the only one working on it. A secret organization has copied his operating system, launching a plot to destroy the digital infrastructure of modern society. A committee organized to coordinate the handling of this crisis has hired an expert videogamer (the player) to prevent that evil plan from coming to fruition.", "shortname": "evola", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "abandoned", "summary": "A videogame about the wonders of operating system concepts.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1867722}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Bug Reports", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/evola/", "video_url": null}
