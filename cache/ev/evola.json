Each creature runs as a separate process. Operating system constructs like signals, files and network ports are represented by objects in this world, and their usage is exposed to running programs by their presence.\r\n\r\nSTORY: EvulOS was invented by a grad student for his thesis, and later gained government research funding. But its inventor is not the only one working on it. A secret organization has copied his operating system, launching a plot to destroy the digital infrastructure of modern society. A committee organized to coordinate the handling of this crisis has hired an expert videogamer (the player) to prevent that evil plan from coming to fruition.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "evola", "_id": "51b7635185540d2cefdaf5c6", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1867722, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bug Reports"}], "summary": "A videogame about the wonders of operating system concepts.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: First Person Shooters", "shortname": "firstpersonshooters", "fullname": "First Person Shooters", "id": 82}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Role-Playing", "shortname": "rpg", "fullname": "Role-Playing", "id": 84}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Simulation", "shortname": "simulation", "fullname": "Simulation", "id": 85}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: OpenGL", "shortname": "ui_opengl", "fullname": "OpenGL", "id": 475}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Other toolkit", "shortname": "ui_othertoolkit", "fullname": "Other toolkit", "id": 495}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
