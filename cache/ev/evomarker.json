Finding the best informative features from a large set of attributes is a combinatorial problem. Capturing partial solutions (some of the important features in a parent in Genetic Algorithm) may yield to fitter parents and fasten the search procedure to converge to a combination of important features. Consequently, this work proposes to use genetic algorithm to efficiently solve this problem. \r\n\r\nThe data is uploaded to EVOMARKER in two files. First one is value file that is a standard CSV file format, where each row is a sample and each column is a variable/attribute/feature. The class numbers are given in the last column for each row (sample). The names of each feature has to be uploaded in the second file which is standard txt file. Each row has a feature name and the order of the rows has to be the same with the order of the columns in the first file. \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "evomarker", "_id": "50fee9df0594ca3b5ae0507e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1251112, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "EVOMARKER: A Powerful Biomarker Detection Tool Using Genetic Algorithm", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
