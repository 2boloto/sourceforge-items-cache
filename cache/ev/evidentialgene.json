The basic Evigene methods involve using available best-of-breed gene prediction and assembly software, combining all evidence for genes, from expressed sequences, genome assembly sequences, related species protein sequences, and any other, to annotate and score gene constructions. Over-produced constructions are classified by gene evidence for best qualities per \"locus\", including genome-aligned and gene-transcript aligned (genome-free) locus identification.   All software developed for EvidentialGene is publicly available.
