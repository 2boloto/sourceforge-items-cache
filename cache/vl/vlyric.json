This is accomplished by utilizing VLC’s “Remote Control” (rc) extra interface, and Marquee display module.\r\n\r\nVLyriC is geared towards individuals who need to broadcast a live video feed of a large meeting or conference (primarily LDS Stake Conferences), and include a text overlay to display names/titles of those speaking and/or lyrics of songs to be sung during the meeting or conference.\r\n\r\nVLyriC depends on the .NET Framework 4 (either the Client Profile or Full frameworks are OK), and has been run on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1.\r\n\r\nThis project is based on the original VLyriC written by Charles Boling (http://ebs.boling.us/apps/vlyric/).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vlyric", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/inventor96/", "username": "inventor96", "name": "Caleb"}], "external_homepage": "http://vlyric.sourceforge.net"}
