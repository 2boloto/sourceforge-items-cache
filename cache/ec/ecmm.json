These models provide many desired characteristics, such as socially influenced mobility decisions and are quite realistic. One specific model, namely the Enhanced Community-based mobility model, is very suitable for opportunistic routing research comparing to the others, because of its advanced properties. These include a pause period, conformance to the existing social ties and the ability to produce periodical epochs during the simulation. This  is therefore, the main mobility model provided by this project. Up to now, OMNET++ and the INET and INETMANET frameworks do not include an opportunistic routing protocol implementation. Additionally, they lack socially-aware mobility model support, thus making the simulation environment not suitable for opportunistic and delay-tolerant research, especially for Mobile Social Network.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ecmm", "_id": "502919ffb9363c2d251a137f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 850153, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "OMNET++ implementation of the Enhanced Community-based Mobility Model", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Simulations", "shortname": "simulations", "fullname": "Simulations", "id": 600}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
