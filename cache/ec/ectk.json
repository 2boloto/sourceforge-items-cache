It allows to define electrochemical experiments either interactively or via a script file sourced by ECTk. Virtually any potensiostat can be driven, the only condition being that the instrument has analogue inputs and outputs. ECTk is developed and maintained by the Electrocatalytic Green Engineering Group at Concordia University.\r\n\r\nECTk communicates via any analogue IO board supported by  the comedi library. This offers a great flexibility as a large number of IO boards are supported by comedi. ECTk is running under Linux and was developed under Linux Ubuntu.\r\n\r\nECTk was developed with the aim to conduct experiments in electrochemistry with a great flexibility. In particular, ECTk can be extended to satisfy the needs for a particular application. It is for example possible to drive, besides a potensiostat, simultaneously other instruments like a rotating electrode set-up.", "shortname": "ectk", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "ECTk - The electrochemical tool kit", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1975770}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ectk/", "video_url": null}
