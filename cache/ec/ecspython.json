ECS:Python is light-weight and easy to use.\r\n\r\nTo get started all you need to do from your project is #include \"EcsPython.h\", and link to the EcsPython library. Included with ECS:Python is a demo project (/example) written to assist developers in understanding how to use the API.\r\n\r\nECS:Python requires a Python distribution to be installed on your system. Python can be downloaded from: www.python.org/download\r\n\r\nWhat's new in v2.8:\r\n* Basic support for constructing C++ objects from Python\r\n* __call__() returns a pointer to the C++ object\r\n* Added support for void* arguments\r\n* Fixed floating point argument bug\r\n* Fixed char* return value bug", "shortname": "ecspython", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Light-weight C++ library for embedding Python into C++", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1075845}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ecspython/", "video_url": null}
