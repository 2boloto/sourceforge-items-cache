ECS:Python allows you to expose objects from a C++ application to an embedded Python interpreter for interactive scripting. ECS:Python is light-weight and easy to use.\r\n\r\nTo get started all you need to do from your project is #include \"EcsPython.h\", and link to the EcsPython library. Included with ECS:Python is a demo project (/example) written to assist developers in understanding how to use the API.\r\n\r\nECS:Python requires a Python distribution to be installed on your system. Python can be downloaded from: www.python.org/download\r\n\r\nWhat's new in v2.8:\r\n* Basic support for constructing C++ objects from Python\r\n* __call__() returns a pointer to the C++ object\r\n* Added support for void* arguments\r\n* Fixed floating point argument bug\r\n* Fixed char* return value bug", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ecspython", "_id": "509ffc337929e50e440d5b56", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1075845, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "link", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Light-weight C++ library for embedding Python into C++", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "shortname": "development", "fullname": "Software Development", "id": 45}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Win2K", "shortname": "mswin_2000", "fullname": "Win2K", "id": 420}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
