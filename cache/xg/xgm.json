Many new units have been added to the Greek factions (and other factions), along with aditional campaigns based on the Greek City States, new buildings, character traits, night battles, named legions, loyalty, and much more. Combat with phalanx based armies has also been made much more challenging. We have tried to stay close to the \"look and feel\" of vanilla RTW, so this mod should appeal to people who like vanilla RTW, but who want to play a more developed version of the Greek factions.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xgm", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/dimebagwhore/", "username": "dimebagwhore", "name": "DimeBagWhore"}], "external_homepage": "http://xgm.sourceforge.net"}
