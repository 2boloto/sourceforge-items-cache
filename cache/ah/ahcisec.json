In most cases only the BIOS of laptops will support sending security commands. This is a disadvantage if you want to use ATA security functions with normal desktop mainboards. Especially for SSDs with build in encryption features based on AES this program is a must have. You can use it from an MS-DOS boot disk without any drivers and it will send all known standard security commands in AHCI mode. This version of AHCISEC was tested with MS-DOS 6.22 started from an USB stick.", "shortname": "ahcisec", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Send ATA Security Commands to HDDs and SSDs running in AHCI mode", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2248084}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ahcisec/", "video_url": null}
