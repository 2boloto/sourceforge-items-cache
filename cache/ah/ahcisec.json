In most cases only the BIOS of laptops will support sending security commands. This is a disadvantage if you want to use ATA security functions with normal desktop mainboards. Especially for SSDs with build in encryption features based on AES this program is a must have. You can use it from an MS-DOS boot disk without any drivers and it will send all known standard security commands in AHCI mode. This version of AHCISEC was tested with MS-DOS 6.22 started from an USB stick.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ahcisec", "_id": "538aedd304161f4ce343224b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2248084, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Send ATA Security Commands to HDDs and SSDs running in AHCI mode", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
