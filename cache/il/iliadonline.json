The engine's design is inspired by a small existing game that has been around for decades, Odyssey http://www.odysseyclassic.com\r\n\r\nCurrently, the source for Odyssey has been opened, but it's still in VB6.  Instead of managing an old code base in an extinct language we're starting from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to bring modern technology on board to expand the play experience.  The goal is to keep to the roots, but bring the gameplay up to date.\r\n\r\nThe engine is being designed to give more control to game designers. Each game created with the engine can be wildly different thanks to content tools and scripting capabilities.", "shortname": "iliadonline", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An Open Engine for use on the OUYA", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1133745}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/iliadonline/", "video_url": ""}
