It holds a lot of penetration testing tools. Instead of having to type everything you can use handy shortcuts. These shortcuts will start an entire penetration test on the target you are currently viewing and will also automate the whole process of becoming \"anonymous\" whilst scanning and exploiting your target.\r\n\r\nThis distro will be for educational purposes only and for penetration tests for which you are authorised to do. If you are not authorised to do the penetration test you are responsible for the consequences of your own actions.
