The standard setting utilizes less than 128MB RAM only, which was fine when the game was developed initially, but nowadays patches and mods lead to a situation where more memory is necessary to smoothly run the game.\r\nThis tool gives the user the ability to easily setup different memory parameters.\r\nAdditionally it features an advanced so called \"wrapper\" to run modded files within the game's runtime file system. This wrapper runs several hundred times faster than the initial wrapper.dll release by QTim and thus enables the users to run even heavily modded game installations without any significant performance impact.\r\nLast but not least, for fine-tuning the JVM memory usage, this selector features a dll code injection mechanism into the running JVM.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "il2selector", "_id": "4e7349481be1ce34c5000edd", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "link", "name": "link", "label": "IL-2 Selector"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 595138, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 Executable Memory Management Enhancer", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Simulation", "shortname": "simulation", "fullname": "Simulation", "id": 85}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
