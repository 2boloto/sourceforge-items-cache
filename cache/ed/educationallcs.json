This eLCS package includes 5 different implementations of a basic LCS algorithm, as part of a 6 stage set of demos that will be paired with the first introductory LCS textbook.   Each eLCS implementations (from demo 2 up to demo 6) progressively add major components of the entire LCS algorithm in order to illustrate how work, how they are coded, and what impact they have on how an LCS algorithm runs.  The Demo 6 version of eLCS is most similar to the UCS algorithm.   Each version only includes the minimum code needed to perform the functions they were designed for.  This way users can start by examining the simplest version of the code and progress forward.  This code is intended to be used as an educational tool, or as algorithmic code building blocks.", "shortname": "educationallcs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "eLCS - Educational Learning Classifier System", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2264635}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/educationallcs/", "video_url": null}
