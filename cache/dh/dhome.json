Our goal is to give the user full access to all of this, in a simple and intuitive way.\r\n\r\nOur project is currently only compatible with the Zipabox by Zipato. We aspire to making it compatible with a great number of other ones.\r\n\r\nDHOME is destined for people to use in their private domicile, but also for companies looking to measure their offices' impact.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dhome", "_id": "55001583b9363c1239387e8d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2423808, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "Open source home automation web interface to analyze your energy data.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
