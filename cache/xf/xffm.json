It also includes several previously XFCE applications (icontheme, difference viewer, search tool, samba navigator)  plus some new stuff (applications menu, filesystems in user space, process control, file shredding, file previews and more).\r\n\r\nIn particular, Rodent filemanager is fast, small and powerful file manager which runs in multicore mode. Currently targeted  for the GNU or BSD operating systems, a  Mingw-w64 version is on the horizon.\r\n\r\nYou should note that Rodent Filemanager is *not* targeted for dummies. Emphasis is on ease of use for the advanced user, not the computer illiterate. \r\n\r\nRodent applications are provided as is, with no particular warranty nor purpose. But if these applications are as useful to you as they are to me, you've  made my day. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!", "shortname": "xffm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "RodentXffm", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://facebook.com/xffm5", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Basic desktop applications", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Rodent-icontheme", "mount_point": "icontheme", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 70875}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Support Requests", "mount_point": "support-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Rodent", "mount_point": "rodent", "name": "git"}, {"label": "libtubo", "mount_point": "tubo", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "librfm", "mount_point": "librfm", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/xffm/", "video_url": ""}
