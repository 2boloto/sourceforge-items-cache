Currently targeted  for the GNU or BSD operating systems, a  Mingw-w64 version is on the horizon.\r\n\r\nYou should note that Rodent Filemanager is *not* targeted for dummies. Emphasis is on ease of use for the advanced user, not the computer illiterate. \r\n\r\nRodent applications are provided as is, with no particular warranty nor purpose. But if these applications are as useful to you as they are to me, you've  made my day. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xffm", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/sagitter/", "username": "sagitter", "name": "Antonio Trande"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/edscott/", "username": "edscott", "name": "Edscott Wilson Garcia"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gregorioinda/", "username": "gregorioinda", "name": "Gregorio Inda"}], "external_homepage": "http://xffm.org"}
