It is designed to be as easy to run as a hand-held calculator. The goal is a neat tool covering all fields of mathematics at advanced highschool and university level.\r\n\r\nMACE has 160 logical operations, statistical distributions and functions in the fields Analysis, Arithmetic, Complex Functions, Linear Algebra, Differential Calculus and Statistics. \r\n\r\nWith this release 10 new functions from the field Differential Calculus come including Curve Sketching numerical integrals, diffferentials, tangents. \r\n\r\nMACE provides a dialog, which supports you to insert functions intuitively. Moreover Mace has a comprehensive help menu to support the user.\r\n\r\nMACE has also its own skripting language for the advanced user.\r\n\r\nMACE can calculate with complex numbers and integral residue classes.\r\n", "shortname": "mace", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/MaceAlgebraicCalculator", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "MACE is a Mathematical program for Algorithms, Calculations, Equations", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 875801}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mace/", "video_url": null}
