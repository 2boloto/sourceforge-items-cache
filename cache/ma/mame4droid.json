MAME4droid (0.139u1) emulates arcade games supported by original MAME 0.139u1.\r\n\r\nThis MAME4droid version is targeted to Dual-Core devices, because it is based on a high specs 2010 PC MAME build. Anyway don't expect arcade games of the 90 to work at full speed. With some games that are really bad optimized (like outrun or mk series) you will need at least a 1.5 ghz dual-core device (Cortex A15). This is related to MAME build used, since it is  targeted to high specs PC's as i said before. \r\n\r\nThis version emulates over 8000 different romsets.\r\n\r\nPlease, try to understand that that with that amount of games, some will run better than others and some might not even run with MAME4droid.\r\n\r\nPlease, don't email me asking for a specific game to run.\r\n\r\nOfficial web page for news, source code & additional information:\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/imame4all/", "shortname": "mame4droid", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "MAME Android Emulator.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2390009}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mame4droid/", "video_url": null}
