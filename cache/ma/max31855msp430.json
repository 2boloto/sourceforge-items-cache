The MSP430 is connected to a UART to USB converter interface to display results on a computer. Complete code, written and tested on TI's Code Composer Studio V4, is included, as well as schematics and reference pictures. These can be downloaded below.\r\n\r\nThree separate development components are used in setting up this solution. These include: the Playing With Fusion MAX31855K-4CH board, a 64-pin MSP430Fxxx breakout populated with an MSP430F167 and a UART to USB converter breakout using the Silicon Labs CP2102 IC. The MSP430 was programmed and debugged using a TI \"MSP-FET430UIF\" debugger. Additionally, the CP2102 chip has the capability to output both 5V (USB) or 3.3V generated on-chip over the GPIO lines. This 3.3V power can also be used in low-power applications to power external devices (maximum total current <100mA), such as the ", "shortname": "max31855msp430", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Interface the Playing With Fusion MAX31855K-4CH thermocouple breakout ", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1270381}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/max31855msp430/", "video_url": ""}
