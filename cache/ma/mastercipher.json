This unique algorithm designed by me is very difficult to exploit using a brute-force attack because of its very complex logic and combination of different algorithms mixed together to develop a strong and an almost unbreakable encryption of a plain text.\r\n\r\nThe software as a whole is of a very small size and has a very easy and basic user interface which makes it very very simple and easy to use. A plain text can be encrypted in many different ways to produce a different encryption each time. As a whole user will be able to carry out the encryption and decryption mechanism without hassle.", "shortname": "mastercipher", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "abandoned", "summary": "Master Cipher offers a suitable solution when you need a protection me", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2455997}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mastercipher/", "video_url": null}
