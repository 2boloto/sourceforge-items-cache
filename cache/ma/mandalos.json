The system can thus be seen essentially as a Human Experience Resynthesizer.\r\nPrincipal usage will be for Real-time Art Content Creation.\r\nParralel processing (GPU) will be a critical element in the implementation of this system. Even then, the goal of this project may fall outside the scope of what is possible with digital computing, in which case the system becomes a model basis for an analog/holographic computer.", "shortname": "mandalos", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Data management and creation system based on holographic principals.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1893270}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mandalos/", "video_url": ""}
