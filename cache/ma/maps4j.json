Specifically, it is based on the study and implementation of the learning strategies presented by Korf in early papers, from an perspective based on Multi-Agent Systems. As a result we have developped Maps4J, a solution where cooperation and coordination among agents, during learning and resolution process, play the main role. Moreover, this project tries to illustrate the virtues of Multi-Agent Systems, related to the learning and the resolution tasks, from a approach based on coordination.\r\n", "shortname": "maps4j", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "MacroAgents Problem Solver for Java", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 816942}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/maps4j/", "video_url": ""}
