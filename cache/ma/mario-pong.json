It was our mission to take their idea of a pong/breakout type game, and the collision detection code they taught us, and to make our own game with the knowledge we learnt.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to texturing the game, I quickly snatched some Mario sprites and sounds for the blocks and after implementing those I decided to do the whole game as Mario theme. The main reason was that I could implement the coins as points, knowing how rewarding it feels collecting coins in Mario, I thought this mechanic would work well.\r\n\r\n== Requirements ==\r\nTo play this game you will need these installed :)\r\n\r\n1. .Net Framework 4\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=24872\r\n\r\n2.
