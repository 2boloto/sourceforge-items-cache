The power of modularization of mixins is enhanced by two unique features.\r\n\r\nThe first feature is the modularization of constructors. In Magda, many mixins with independent definitions of constructors can be combined without the need to copy any code and without the risk of clashes. \r\n\r\nThe second distinctive feature modifies the way declarations of new methods, overriding methods, and method calls are done, in order to rule out accidental name clashes, even with respect to future modifications of the code. \r\n\r\nA collection of samples written in Magda language are also available.", "shortname": "magdalanguage", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Magda language resource site", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 646698}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/magdalanguage/", "video_url": ""}
