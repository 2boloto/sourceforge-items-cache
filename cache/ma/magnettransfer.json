Many people have the same setup as I do, where .torrent files are saved in a shared folder on a server, so that the Torrent Client automatically starts the download.  \r\n\r\nThis application includes a client and a server, coded in Java.\r\nThe server application, listens, on the configured port for, Magnet URIs to be sendt from the client.  When one is recieved, the configured torrent client adds the download to the client.\r\n\r\nThe client is very simple \"fire and forget\" type of java program, where a registry setting enables it to start everytime you click a \"magnet:\" in any browser.  The client then sends the magnet URI, in it's entirety, to the server application, which then adds the download to the torrent client.\r\n\r\nThis is just an alpha release, so the current code has a very crude design.", "shortname": "magnettransfer", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Starts Magnet downloads in a torrent client on a remote computer", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "MagnetServer", "mount_point": "mserver", "name": "git"}, {"label": "MagnetClient", "mount_point": "mclient", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 726168}, {"label": "MagnetServer_branch1", "mount_point": "magnetserver", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/magnettransfer/", "video_url": ""}
