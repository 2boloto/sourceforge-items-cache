The objective is to find the gems amongst the other dynamic maze elements.

Scripts allow new players to acquire skills gently and provide diabolically dastard puzzles for the expert.\r\n  The included maze help manual is an exhaustive treatise of mazeology that will enlighten you to the subtle beauty of maze's simplicity and sophistication. \r\n  The desktop screenshot shows the two versions running side by side for comparison.\r\n  ", "shortname": "mazeman", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A scriptable 2d randomizable maze game", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1038662}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mazeman/", "video_url": ""}
