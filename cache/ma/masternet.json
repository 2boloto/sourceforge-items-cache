Essentially, a \u201cthinking internet\u201d.\r\n\r\nWe are adopting a SETI style model for computation distribution. Each client computer simulates a neuron or a bundle of neurons and is capable of sending reqs to the MASTER server, which then divides its problem and solves it by using the massive amounts of processing cores connected to it by the world-wide network (in this case, the Internet). \r\n\r\nTherefore each client both has a connection to the server to request computation, with solutions encouraging them to connect to the network, because of its advanced parallel computation and AI functionality. Also to perform the calculation of requests as part of a massively parallel computation system.\r\n\r\n\"MASTERNET\" provides both a computational resource as well as pseudo-intelligence that with enough nodes will be on par with the intelligence of a living creature ", "shortname": "masternet", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1947836}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/masternet/", "video_url": ""}
