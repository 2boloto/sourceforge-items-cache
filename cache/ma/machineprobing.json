The \"Machine Probing\" Operation will allow for Probing Cycles to be Simulated and Posted to G-Code.  The Technology will allow you to select \"Canned Probing Cycles\", which are the ones that came with the Probe. This is the first of two Operations that will be created.  The other operation is called \"Custom Machine Probing\".\r\n\r\nThe \"Custom Machine Probing\" Operation will allow an array of different and advanced probing features.  Instead of just using the built-in Canned Probing Cycles (Macros).  The G31 Skip signal will be used along with Local/Common/System Variables and you can enter custom Expressions and assign those Expressions to Machine System Variables or any origin you would like.  The Probing Operation can be used on any Machine that is similar to either Fanuc's Macro or Okuma's User Task (Macro) languages.
