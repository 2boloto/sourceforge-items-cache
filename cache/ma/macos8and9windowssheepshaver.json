It contains everything needed, simply unzip the file and install a few things. For in-depth information, see the READ_ME.TXT file in the package.\r\n\r\nThis is a project that I have been tweaking around with since late 2011. It started with Mac OS 9.0.4, a newworld ROM file, and the SheepShaver program + the GUI. I have since added a lot to the package, and will post any update info here.\r\n\r\nAs of current update:\r\n- Minor bug: Must install GTK Runtime to default folder in Windows 7. Not under my control, this is a problem with GTK.\r\n- Glitch fixed: Disk Tools not wanting to boot.\r\n- GTK Runtime setup added to package\r\n- HFV Explorer added to package\r\n- Added Mac OS 8.TOAST to package, rather than a seperate download\r\n- A new update of HFV Explorer allows a fullscreen resolution of higher than 640x480", "shortname": "macos8and9windowssheepshaver", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "SheepShaver Package for Windows.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2243081}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/macos8and9windowssheepshaver/", "video_url": null}
