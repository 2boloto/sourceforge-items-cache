Users could understand the underlying bins (genomes) of the microbes in their metagenomes by simply providing assembled metagenomic sequences and the reads coverage information or sequencing reads. For users' convenience MaxBin will report genome-related statistics, including estimated completeness, GC content and genome size in the binning summary page. Users could use MEGAN or similar software on MaxBin bins to find out the taxonomy of each bin after the binning process is finished.\r\n\r\nMaxBin supports most Linux system. It currently does not support Mac system yet.\r\n\r\nMaxBin was published on Microbiome journal (2:26)! Please cite the Microbiome paper if you use MaxBin in your work.\r\n\r\nPlease go to http://downloads.jbei.org/data/MaxBin.html to download test datasets and sample binning results for HMP datasets.\r\n", "shortname": "maxbin", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An automatic tool for binning metagenomics sequences", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2213020}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/maxbin/", "video_url": null}
