MADARA was originally developed as an agent-based middleware specifically for real-time, distributed artificial intelligence, but is now more general purpose for distributed timing, control, knowledge and reasoning, and quality-of-service.\r\n\r\nMADARA is composed of several tools and middleware, and the main entry point into the system is the Knowledge and Reasoning Language (KaRL) Engine, which provides a real-time scripting language for nanosecond execution times hooked into a flexible transport layer for distributed reasoning. The KaRL engine also supports object-oriented C++, Java, and Python programming through Containers, classes that provide abstractions and references for variable location within the KaRL Knowledge Base.\r\n\r\nThis project is currently in process of being ported from http://madara.googlecode.com.", "shortname": "madara", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Middleware for distributed applications", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2352494}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/madara/", "video_url": null}
