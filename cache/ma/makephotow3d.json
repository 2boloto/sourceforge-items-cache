Here we create a nice animation that slides back and forth, for a smooth wiggle 3D (\"w3D\") effect.  First the image is broken down into planes.  Each plane is given a depth distance.  The image belonging to each plane is horizontally compressed enough that the \"shadows\" cast by the image belonging to the planes in front of it cover the \"holes\" in the plane.  The whole thing is then animated in a gentle see-saw fashion to get the wiggle effect.
