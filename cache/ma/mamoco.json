Our aim is to support introduction of problem based learning into the courses of mathematics and natural sciences, where closed-form problems are dominating the curriculum, and to allow schooling youth to bring their knowledge outside of the classroom, thus building their carrer network.\r\n\r\nThe project is in development and is expected to launch in spring 2015.
