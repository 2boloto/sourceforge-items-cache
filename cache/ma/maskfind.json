I noticed that sometimes people were missing some of the IP addresses on a router/firewall when port scanning a host.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the diagram above, if somebody were to do a blind penetration test and they were to run a port scan against the web site's IP(x.236.50.2) after discovering the web site they would only come across 2 open ports. If they were to run maskfind against the websites IP after discovering the web site they would discover that the firewall actually has a /29 block assigned and then after port scanning all of the IP's they would be able to discover 4 open ports.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems please post in the forums and I will help you out.", "shortname": "maskfind", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "For finding remote subnet masks", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 770494}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/maskfind/", "video_url": ""}
