The objective is to find a number or a sequence of numbers that add up to the target number.\r\nFor example, when a single number like 6 is displayed, you can press 6 directly or a sequence of numbers that add up to 6 like 1, 2 and 3 or 2 and 4 or 1 and 5. Also, if a number like 11 is shown as the target number, you can press 2 and 9 or 3 and 8 or 4 and 7 or 1, 3 and 7 or 2, 3 and 6 or 5 and 6. For any target number the goal is to add up to it.\r\nA high number like 30 requires a sequence that can vary like 1, 9, 2, 8, 4 and 6. The goal still being that the sum of the sequence adds up to 30. Because there is a limit to how many numbers can be summed, the limit of the target numbers is 40.\r\nAs the game progresses and your score increases, the game becomes progressively harder by increasing the range of target numbers and reducing the available time.", "shortname": "mathsmagic", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Maths Magic Game", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 771587}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mathsmagic/", "video_url": ""}
