MatchPoint is a framework in its original meaning. It focuses on concepts and paradigms that form a frame which eases the utilization of registration algorithms (own and external work) and their integration in arbitrary applications. The concrete implementation of algorithmic components is not a focus of MatchPoint. Topics addressed and facilitated by MatchPoint are inter alia support of algorithm evaluation, registration algorithms as services, support of parallel data processing, encapsulation of registration domain complexity and intuitive, less error prone handling for none registration domain experts. If you search for registration algorithms you should look at projects like ITK, Plastimatch, Elastix ... . If you search for framework that helps you to integrate these registration developments or others into your application, you are at the right place.", "shortname": "matchpoint", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Translational (image) registration framework", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1948769}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/matchpoint/", "video_url": ""}
