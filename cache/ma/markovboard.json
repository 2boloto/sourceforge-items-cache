I have designed a 3D camera that can take still images of a scene with a given subject.  The camera and objects share a common base structure, RigidBody.  The camera includes a projection method so giving the view of the world from the camera.  The objects are called Scene Objects and contain, in addition to Rigid Body, a Bounding Box.  The Bounding box is a cube surrounding the object giving easy to calculate points for statistics.\r\nWhen a shot is taken the Markov chains showing the statistics of shot transitions updates.  For ease of reading the Markov chains are depicted as tables.\r\nCurrently QTCreator is required to run the program.", "shortname": "markovboard", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Senior Project.
