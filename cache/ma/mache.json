This CPU-intensive technique cannot be used to generate \"live\" or dynamic SIRDS.\r\n\r\nThis project explores an algorithm that takes advantage of OpenGL hardware acceleration to generate animated SIRDS. The algorithm is so simple that it can be deployed on light-weight platforms like smartphones and tablets.\r\n\r\nImagine taking a picture using your mobile device as the randomized \"foreground\" image. Looking through this image with the correct divergence of focus will reveal a hidden 3D object or scene. As with all SIRDS, the 3D object will appear to be wrapped in a texture of the foreground image like a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.\r\n", "shortname": "mache", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Dynamic Generation of Single Image Random Dots Stereogram", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 662344}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mache/", "video_url": ""}
