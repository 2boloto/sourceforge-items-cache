The user then selects the number of fiducial markers (or landmarks) and places them on the floating and reference images. A \"Find Centroid\" button is included, which will locate all centroids in the image. After selecting the markers on both images, the user clicks \"Register\". The floating image has a transformation applied which will map it to the reference image. An \"Overlap\" button is included which will allow the user to confirm registration.\r\n\r\nSupports Bitmap, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and Analyze75 image formats.", "shortname": "matlabaffinereg", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Matlab GUI for 2D Affine Image Registration", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1898794}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/matlabaffinereg/", "video_url": ""}
