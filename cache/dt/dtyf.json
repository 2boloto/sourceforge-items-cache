The program reads Data-Project-1.txt which contains data for bacterial populations in diseased and healthy subjects. The program takes the averages of diseased and healthy subjects for each bacteria. Then it calculates the distance between diseased and healthy. Based on the distances, the bacteria are classified as up-regulated or down-regulated. These are used to select diagnostic markers and then determine whether the subjects in Data-Project-2.txt are diseased or healthy.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dtyf", "_id": "555b9f56bcf63a244935f348", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 2465318, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}], "summary": "Determining diseased and healthy subjects using the terminal", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
