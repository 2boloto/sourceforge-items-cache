It has been tested with an HP 8720D VNA with firmware 7.74. It is likely to require modification to run on other VNAs such as the 8753 series, since the software passes commands to the VNA that other VNAs may not understand. \r\n\r\nThe software has only been tested on Solaris SPARC, but it should compile under Linux too. \r\n\r\nThe software has a command line interface, with no GUI. It is unlikely to built on Windows without a considerable effort. Windows uses are encouraged to use the KE5FX GPIB Toolkit, which includes a file VNA.EXE.
