Today\u2019s multi-core computers bring that parallelism into the realm of everyday use.  It is important to provide thread safe containers and classes in this environment.  The HPC Template Library (HTL) aims to replace certain portions of the STL.  It is a merger and rewrite of classes from the STL, QT, Boost, and SigSlots libraries.  It is designed as a dynamic linked library for the user to include directly in their projects.  It is written for the Windows platform, although the user could adapt it for use in Linux / Unix by changing only the HtlThread and HtlTime sub packages.  The code is designed to be easy to read and well documented.  The HTL has 14 sub packages to parcel functionality of different classes.
