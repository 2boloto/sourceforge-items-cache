Each benchmark is designed for specific domains such as multimedia, digital signal processing, security, image processing, etc. The programs are provided with the objective to enable researchers analyze their innovative algorithms and techniques and help users compare the quality of results of state of the art commercial High Level Synthesis tools available in industry.\r\n\r\nYou can log in to our Youtube channel to watch some videos about S2CBench and SystemC in general www.youtube.com/DARClabify\r\n\r\nTo know more about the designs and why they were included in the benchmark suite you can read  the following academic paper:\r\nB.
