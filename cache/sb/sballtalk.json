The XObject can be anything such as nodes, users, tasks, services, resources and so on.\r\nAdditionally, SballTalk has modules that can be added to it dynamically. Each module performs special task such as monitoring, virtual machines management, virtual switches management and so on.\r\nLightweight core of SballTalk is a cluster aware which manages objects and\r\nresponsible for synchronizing XObject Repositories. All data relating to each object is saved locally on each node of the cluster so there is no need to use a shared storage space.\r\nRGManager/Pacemaker could be developed as modules by SballTalk.", "shortname": "sballtalk", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "SballTalk is a Distributed (X)Object Repository based on corosync.
