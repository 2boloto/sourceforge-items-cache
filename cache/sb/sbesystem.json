The loss of the faculty to speak is also one of the symptoms. To obtain the ability to communicate, the patients are dependent on the use of assistive technology. Modern Eye Control systems are able to afford this. However in some cases patients cannot use those systems. The aim of this master thesis is to develop an alternative communication system to support the patients during interaction with other people. The described system is a combination of software and hardware. To use the system, the patient only needs the capability of a minimal residual movement of any body part.", "shortname": "sbesystem", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple communication system for paralysed patients", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2375158}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sbesystem/", "video_url": null}
