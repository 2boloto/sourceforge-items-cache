The solution is to reduce the server communication for such mistakes. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the project is to capture and address unintentional human errors that could be resolved at the client side during the login process.\r\n\r\nSolution Abstract:\r\nAn array of images are loaded at the client side. One of the images is displayed for every password entered based on a simple algorithm. The image is computed based on the password and hence it will change only when the user changes his password. Hence, the displayed image will become familiar to the user until he changes the password. It helps the user understand whether he input the right password before sending it to the server. \r\n\r\nThis would be of great help in highly busy servers like stock-market and bandwidth challenged networks such as mobile data networks and dial-up networks.", "shortname": "loginprecheck", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "The project is to do pre-check of password before sending to server", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code on GIT", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code on SVN", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1038652}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/loginprecheck/", "video_url": ""}
