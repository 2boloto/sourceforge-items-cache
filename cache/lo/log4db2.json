This utility aims to reduce the time used for developing, testing, debugging and monitoring SQL routines, by centralizing the messages produced by the code.\r\n\r\nThe idea and architecture of this utility are based on the popular Java logging utilities, such as Log4j and slf4j/logback.\r\n\r\n * Log4j [http://logging.apache.org/log4j]\r\n * Logback/SLF4J [http://logback.qos.ch/] [http://www.slf4j.org/]\r\n\r\nThe license of the source code is \"BSD 2-Clause license\", and for the documentation is \"FreeBSD Documentation license.\" With these two licences you are free to use, modify and distribute any part of this utility.", "shortname": "log4db2", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Logging utility for DB2 for LUW written in SQL-PL", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2089378}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/log4db2/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/QeZmAiTLqdk?rel=0"}
