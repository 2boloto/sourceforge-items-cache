A key feature of the Loci framework are that these computational kernels are documented such that the data-flow between kernels can be extracted using relational annotations that are provided by the rules. In this system the given data is provided as a set of facts (relations). The application is then given in the form of a collection of transformation rules. Finally, the user makes a query (e.g. what is the heat flux at this surface?) From this the scheduler provided by the Loci framework provide a composition of the provided transformations that will answer the query. The effect of the programming model is to place numerical programming in a sphere similar to one of information management using relation databases where problems are solved using powerful relational queries.", "shortname": "lociframework", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Loci Autoparallelizing Framework", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2462542}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lociframework/", "video_url": null}
