It does the following:\r\n\r\n- takes two related traces from ProcMon (the Windows Internals API monitor)\r\n- splits them into separate threads\r\n- matches the threads from one trace to the other, based on similarity (basically identifies which thread is which)\r\n- displays all the threads and their details in a sortable table\r\n- edits out all the numbers, timestamps, pointers, etc that shouldn't matter when comparing diffs\r\n- shows you a visual diff of any pair of threads, so you can see where the differences actually are\r\n\r\nIt uses KDiff3, GNU diff and grep, and Qt 4 (the Windows binary includes everything required to run). Tested on Windows, should compile on Unix.", "shortname": "logdiff", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": " LogDiff is a tool that compares two ProcMon traces grouped by threads", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1757996}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/logdiff/", "video_url": ""}
