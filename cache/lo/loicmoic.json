It was written by me in Visual Basic. It uploads a large amount of data to the selected server. It has a very similar GUI to Low Orbit Ion Cannon so that it is easy for people to use. Once your press \"IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER\" it asks yout to click OK in case that you accidentally pressed it or you realized that it wouldn't be a good idea. MOIC will be updated regularly (Hopefully) and I would be grateful of any contributions of any info about bugs etc. (I'm only twelve years old so there will be a few bugs to fix.\") This comes as a standalone exe or as in installer. Both versions are included in the Zip. Thanks for checking this out and download it if you want! Thanks, Christian.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~READ~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nThe exe is called gtaguy235's game because AVG has already added my program to their definitions and it detects it as virus. (You can check the source if you want, it is fine.)
