Longford also incorporates Box2D allowing realistic physics to be added to your games and apps. Longford is designed to be as platform agnostic as possible. Currently it can output native apps for Windows and BlackBerry PlayBook (and BB OS10 phones). However, since the code is available open source, it can be ported to any operating system and device and we encourage people to do this. Soon, Longford will support Windows Phone 8, stay tuned!\r\n\r\nWith Longford you can write your app once in Lua and then export it for any platform that Longford supports. You do not need to change the Lua code when recompiling for different targets. Thus Longford is a truly cross platform programming system.
