Thanks to these efforts, we have reached a clear picture of the most commonly mutated genes in various types of cancer. However, we are still far from a complete picture of rarely mutated genes, which can be an important target for personalized medicine.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this difficulty, we have implemented LowMACA (Low frequency Mutation Analysis via Consensus Alignment), a new method able to assess specific characteristics of rarely mutated genes that show patterns of positive selection. LowMACA aggregates and analyzes the mutational patterns of several genes whose encoded proteins have a high level of sequence similarity or share specific protein domains.
