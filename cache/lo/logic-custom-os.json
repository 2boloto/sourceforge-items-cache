My concept of \"Layer of Layer OS\" or LoLOS, is that this command driven OS can run on the JVM(layer one) and then run on your primary Operating system(Unix,Linux,Windows,Mac) which is layer two. This project is a proof of concept for my self and I would share it with the Open Source world. Logic Custom OS will have many features all listed in the wiki. The project is Java based and will support most versions of Java the JRE and JDK. And most importantly its open source anyone can edit this software and use it for themselves!", "shortname": "logic-custom-os", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A students experimental command driven OS ", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 674120}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/logic-custom-os/", "video_url": ""}
