You can also write the Java code into its window. Uses Javassist internal compiler on the new Java code assembled by renaming variables to overlap eachother and reordering, copying, and removing blocks of code. Listen to the recorded music in files section of sourceforge or try it for yourself. This branched into my other projects: GigaLineCompile, JSelfModify, JSoundCard, and Human AI Net as I got more into the AI and systems side of things and explored vision research as a better user interface to network minds together through the Internet.
