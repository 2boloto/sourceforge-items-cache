An integrated approach based on standardized exchange formats, models and interfaces will lead to an increased efficiency in automotive HMI-development with benefits for the entire supply chain: from the vehicle manufacturer and its suppliers to the developers of specialized development tools.\r\n\r\nA model-based approach is required for the iterative refinement of system specifications for complex automotive HMI-systems leading to formal and machine readable exchange documents. Thus today\u2019s digital divide resulting from inconsistent exchange formats and paper based workflows among the process participants can be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe project automotiveHMI is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi).", "summary": "An exchange format for automotive specification information.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1994549, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "automotivehmi", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/orfgen/", "username": "orfgen", "name": "Marius Orfgen"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://www.automotivehmi.org/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
