The most significant change is the addition of a 'info' field to automaton states, allowing them to be associated with a token type.  A few automaton operations were modified to preserve the value of this field.  I have not given much thought to whether it would even make sense to preserve the 'info' field through some of the other operations.\r\n\r\nThis project also includes an extension of RunAutomaton, called TokenAutomaton, that can be used as a lexer, as well as its support classes and examples of its use.\r\n\r\nLexers generated by JPlex depend on this library.  I separated it from JPlex so that projects using JPlex would not depend on GPL code.  Revision 1 of this project is dual-licensed, as it is the same code that was formerly part of JPlex.  All code in this library was either originally published under the BSD license or was exclusively authored by me.", "summary": "A Java library for creating DFA-powered lexical analyzers", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 831724, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "automatonlexer", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kevinsevenseven/", "username": "kevinsevenseven", "name": "Kevin"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "fullname": "BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 187}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Compilers", "fullname": "Compilers", "shortname": "compilers", "id": 48}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
