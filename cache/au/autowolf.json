The source code to the game has been released as GPL.\r\n\r\nThe port implements a \"bot\" for this game, where the player is controlled by the computer, in the attempt to solve every level autonomously.\r\n\r\nAvailable as binaries for Windows and OS X, and as source package for Linux/UNIX (requires SDL and SDL_mixer to build). An experimental build has been released for 16-bit DOS and can be run with DOSBox.\r\n\r\nSee the following YouTube videos for demonstration:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H4a7JfuKRw (alpha02, SDL)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04n72MSuZIA (alpha01, DOS experimental)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAtqihh__jM (alpha01, SDL)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0CONDuIvk (prerelease, SDL)\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ooIlHWqP68 (prerelease, SDL)\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "autowolf", "_id": "4fbfde8e1be1ce484c00012e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 779393, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Bot for id Software's Wolfenstein 3D", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: First Person Shooters", "shortname": "firstpersonshooters", "fullname": "First Person Shooters", "id": 82}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Hobbies", "shortname": "hobbies", "fullname": "Hobbies", "id": 772}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: SDL", "shortname": "ui_sdl", "fullname": "SDL", "id": 480}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: MS-DOS", "shortname": "msdos", "fullname": "MS-DOS", "id": 215}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
