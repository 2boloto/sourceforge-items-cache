You have to provide an answer, validate it, send it to the authority, wait for answers, reply again, follow up the action plan, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAuditTracker does just that for you. Enter items of your audit report, upload evidences and let Audit Tracker remind actionnees they have to answer the audit, write a letter to the scheme or act upon something they have commited to. \r\n\r\nMoreover, AuditTracker can generate the answer to scheme for you as a Word document. If you need to provide some evidences, AuditTracker will also collect them for you as a Zip file, ready to be sent to the certifying authority.\r\n\r\nYou can try an online demo here: demo.audittracker.org", "summary": "Track down your certifying audits", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1965670, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Doc"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "audittracker", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/choowie/", "username": "choowie", "name": "Jean-Luc Dupont"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/log.png", "caption": "Login page", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/log.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/site.png", "caption": "Site management", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/site.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/user.jpg", "caption": "Adding users", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/user.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/standard.jpg", "caption": "Adding a standard", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/standard.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/creation1.jpg", "caption": "Audit creation wizard 1/4", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/audittracker/screenshot/creation1.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}], "license": [], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "fullname": "MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "id": 524}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Scheduling", "fullname": "Scheduling", "shortname": "scheduling", "id": 130}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: To-Do Lists", "fullname": "To-Do Lists", "shortname": "todo_lists", "id": 588}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "fullname": "Security", "shortname": "security", "id": 43}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "id": 537}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Auditors", "fullname": "Auditors", "shortname": "auditors", "id": 864}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "id": 866}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Security", "fullname": "Security", "shortname": "secindustry", "id": 867}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Management", "fullname": "Management", "shortname": "management", "id": 725}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}]}}
