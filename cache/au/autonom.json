It originally will be used in an unknown place by an autonom entity in order for it to find its way, without any human intervention.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0.0 has been released for both on Linux and on Windows platforms. In this very first release, there's a two-dimensional matrix which is 10x10 size. Our autonom entity enters into the matrix from the pre-determined starting point which is (9,4). autonom is expected to find its way until it reaches the (0,x) point.\r\n\r\nIn version 1.0.0, we have limitations;\r\n- We're in 2 dimensional world, meaning we have only x and y axis.\r\n- We have a one-way graph. There's only one solution to find the way from the starting point to the (0,x) point.\r\n\r\nFuture versions will include 3 dimensional space and will include more complex mazes with many solutions.\r\n\r\nArda Ulas UNLU\r\nardaulas@hotmail.com", "summary": "Enter a two dimensional maze and exit automatically.", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1933175, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "autonom", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ardaulas/", "username": "ardaulas", "name": "ardaulas"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "id": 15}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games", "fullname": "Puzzle Games", "shortname": "Puzzles", "id": 268}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}]}}
