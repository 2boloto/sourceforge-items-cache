Deposited are 3 versions, used for my PhD Thesis.  These allow for mutation of short 2-15 amino acid peptides, and associated screening of these using AutoDock or AutoDock Vina, allowing for 8 CPU systems to screen 10K peptides a day or 1-2K with flexible residues added in.  A detailed method for determining the peptide ligand for any sequenced and modeled T cell receptor will be published and link added at some point. These scripts are written quickly in a couple weeks to meet a task and could be re-written more eloquently.  I may or may not work on this project again, the goal would be to introduce amino acids into any protein in openCL to allow automated design on GPU's.Limits-The standard PDB codes used slightly modified, proline not at angles, peptide shld be linear,", "shortname": "autmatedpeptide", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Screening peptides for MHC and/or MHC-T cell receptor affinity", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1259000}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/autmatedpeptide/", "video_url": ""}
