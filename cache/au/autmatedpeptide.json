Deposited are 3 versions, used for my PhD Thesis.  These allow for mutation of short 2-15 amino acid peptides, and associated screening of these using AutoDock or AutoDock Vina, allowing for 8 CPU systems to screen 10K peptides a day or 1-2K with flexible residues added in.  A detailed method for determining the peptide ligand for any sequenced and modeled T cell receptor will be published and link added at some point. These scripts are written quickly in a couple weeks to meet a task and could be re-written more eloquently.  I may or may not work on this project again, the goal would be to introduce amino acids into any protein in openCL to allow automated design on GPU's.Limits-The standard PDB codes used slightly modified, proline not at angles, peptide shld be linear,", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "autmatedpeptide", "_id": "510680b40594ca4bc209e69d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1259000, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Screening peptides for MHC and/or MHC-T cell receptor affinity", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Molecular Science", "shortname": "molecular_science", "fullname": "Molecular Science", "id": 609}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Affero GNU Public License", "shortname": "agpl", "fullname": "Affero GNU Public License", "id": 670}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
