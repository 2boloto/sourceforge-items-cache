The protocol specification can be deployed in a few strategically-placed network nodes and in user-installable software modules (pseudo device drivers and/or user-mode daemons) that reside underneath the socket API of end-nodes' operating systems. \r\n\r\nProject was moved here from the UT of Dallas website as it contains a few additional changes and to increase visibility - changes and tickets are welcome!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "automulticastnoexplicittunnels", "_id": "5407bc129095473e9112aaf9", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2317321, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
