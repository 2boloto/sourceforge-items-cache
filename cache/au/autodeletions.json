You could for example create your own custom scheduled tasks to run this tool daily in the background of your servers, or even decide to run it interactively.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to configure AutoDeletions to send alert mails concerning errors that may occur during the deletion process.", "summary": "Log file remover oriented for Windows Servers (x86 & x64)", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2209319, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "autodeletions", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/albertoandreo/", "username": "albertoandreo", "name": "Alberto Andreo"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/autodeletions/screenshot/2014-05-24%2010_06_19-AutoDeletions%20v1.7.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/autodeletions/screenshot/2014-05-24%2010_06_19-AutoDeletions%20v1.7.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/autodeletions/screenshot/2014-05-24%2010_07_00-About%20AutoDeletions....png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/autodeletions/screenshot/2014-05-24%2010_07_00-About%20AutoDeletions....png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/autodeletions/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "id": 230}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "fullname": "C#", "shortname": "csharp", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: File Management", "fullname": "File Management", "shortname": "file_management", "id": 601}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "id": 253}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Logging", "fullname": "Logging", "shortname": "logging", "id": 148}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
