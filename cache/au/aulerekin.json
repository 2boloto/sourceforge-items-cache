With the help of the Microsoft Kinect sensor the movement of the lecturer are followed and the movement information send to a connected PTZ unit like a webcam.\r\nThe application is not bounded to specific hardware or software. So it is possible to develope plug-ins for the detection of the movement and for the movement following. So several techniques like image algorithms can be used for the detection as also different camera types.\r\n\r\nThe application was developed for my master thesis in computer science and the code will be published as soon i have my grades.", "shortname": "aulerekin", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "This project enables a PTZ camera to follow a person with the Kinect", "tools": [{"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "aulerekin", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 732133}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aulerekin/", "video_url": ""}
