The entire project is based on the principles of Photogrammetry.\r\nThe subject of interest is embedded with patterns of retro-reflective dots. The reason that these dots were attached is that they appear very bright in the image if it is captured using flash. An auto-bar is used to define the coordinate system reference. \r\nThe algorithm which performs this transformation is broken down to several steps. First step is converting the images to grayscale. Then detecting the retro-reflective dots by the \u201cPolygon\u201d approach. Same dots in different images were matched by Pattern Matching algorithm. Then internal and external camera calibration was performed. Finally, the 3D Coordinate points were generated by the \u201cBundle Adjustment\u201d procedure.", "summary": "The project aims at generating 3D coordinates from a set of 2D images", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2358945, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "auto3dcoordinatesgenerator", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/sankhya/", "username": "sankhya", "name": "Sankhya Chakravarty"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://auto3dcoordinatesgenerator.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
