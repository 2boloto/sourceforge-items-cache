Unique words are the one which have the same meaning or might be redundant in the document. These are removed by a method called stemming. \r\n\r\nBy using the Stemming mechanism the occurrence of a word is calculated and the results are displayed in the format of how many times they occur and the number of sentences they have occurred.\r\n", "shortname": "autosummarizationtoolusingjava", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Auto summarization provides a concise summary for a document.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1948264}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/autosummarizationtoolusingjava/", "video_url": ""}
