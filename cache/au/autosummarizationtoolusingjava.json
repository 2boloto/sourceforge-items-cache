In this I present a Statistical approach to addressing the text generation problem in domain-independent, single-document summarization.\r\nMy thesis Includes salton\u2019s vector space model which divides the sentences into categories which can also be used for summarizing the contents in WebPages.\r\n\r\nThe summarizer initially breaks the entire document into sentences based on the separators.\r\nThe Second step is that the unnecessary words are removed from the document. \r\nThe document after removing the stop words is revised again for the unique words. Unique words are the one which have the same meaning or might be redundant in the document. These are removed by a method called stemming. \r\n\r\nBy using the Stemming mechanism the occurrence of a word is calculated and the results are displayed in the format of how many times they occur and the number of sentences they have occurred.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "autosummarizationtoolusingjava", "_id": "522b6a087929e54964d3d0d7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1948264, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Auto summarization provides a concise summary for a document.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
