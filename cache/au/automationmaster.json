With Automation Master you can play \"what if\" games to test control strategies.  Equipment damage during system start-ups is reduced by thoroughly testing control systems in the laboratory prior to their installation in the field. Performance at capacities which may not be reached for years is assured since the automated system can be tested under any conditions using real time simulation.  Automation Master reduces the field debugging cost of control software by up to 90%.\r\n", "shortname": "automationmaster", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Realtime Simulation Software for factory/warehouse automation projects", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2055158}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/automationmaster/", "video_url": ""}
