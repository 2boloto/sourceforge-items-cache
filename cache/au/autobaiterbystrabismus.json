It sends a series of replies to scam emails, a new reply for each email from a given address. The idea is to waste the time of a large number of 419 scammers, who will all be trying to extract money from an automated script. The scam emails may be collected in a \"catcher\" account, e.g. by signing up at muguguestbook.com. The script runs on the same server that hosts the email accounts, and the emails have a \"from\" address corresponding to a \"baiter\" account. Attribution is to the server on which the script and email accounts are hosted.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be taken with safety. A careful inspection of the catcher account is essential in order to avoid the involvement of Innocent Third Parties (ITPs). An empty file called safety.txt can be deleted to halt execution of a runaway script.", "summary": "Automatically baits 419 scammers", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2396811, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "autobaiterbystrabismus", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jbstrabismus/", "username": "jbstrabismus", "name": "JB Strabismus"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://autobaiterbystrabismus.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
