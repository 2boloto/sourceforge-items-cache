It's built on top of arguably the most popular commercial security testing tool Burp Suite from PortSwigger and Buby from E. Monti and T. Duehr.\r\n\r\nThe major use cases and advantages can be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Run security scans offline from a command line headless (without UI);\r\n\r\n2) Change the type of scanning easily by changing configuration parameters;\r\n\r\n3) Extend the BScan's functionality by adding external modules;\r\n\r\n4) Utilize Burp's default spidering, active and passing scanning features;\r\n\r\n5) Integrate scan with different sources of known injections (e.g. Google's fuzzdb: http://code.google.com/p/fuzzdb/);\r\n\r\n6) Create comprehensive security regression tests suites from artifacts provided by security auditors and run them periodically from a command line;\r\n\r\n7) Log found issues to a plain text file. \r\n\r\nMore info: http://gryb.info/bscan", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "b-scan", "_id": "50218f80b9363c238aa1d704", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "trunk", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 845788, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "BScan is an extendable application security scanner", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
