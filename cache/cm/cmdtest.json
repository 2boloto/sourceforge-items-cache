Comments must stay on their own line and should start with a # sign.\r\n\r\nThe documentation uses the term target to refer to a program that is being tested. To create a new target use the TARGET command. To change current target use the SWITCH command. Targets are discarded only at the end of the program. If you do not check explicitly for program exit using END TARGET or EXIT CODE, the program will check this itself at the end. Finding a target still running at this point is considered to be a failed test.\r\n", "shortname": "cmdtest", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Utility to test console applications", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1859830}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cmdtest/", "video_url": ""}
