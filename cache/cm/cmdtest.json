Each line is interpreted and compared against a list of known commands. Comments must stay on their own line and should start with a # sign.\r\n\r\nThe documentation uses the term target to refer to a program that is being tested. To create a new target use the TARGET command. To change current target use the SWITCH command. Targets are discarded only at the end of the program. If you do not check explicitly for program exit using END TARGET or EXIT CODE, the program will check this itself at the end. Finding a target still running at this point is considered to be a failed test.\r\n", "summary": "Utility to test console applications", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1859830, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cmdtest", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/xtnickx/", "username": "xtnickx", "name": "Nicu Tofan"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://cmdtest.sourceforge.net/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "fullname": "Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "id": 479}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "fullname": "BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 187}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing", "fullname": "Testing", "shortname": "testing", "id": 575}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
