Before this Month, we only had herring kernel/device tree for the device.  Aries is smooth and allows for more compatible rom development and porting.  Stock software on SGS4G was halted at Gingerbread for SGS4G from Samsung.  While others have made ICS Roms with a hacked GB kernel (herring), this is one of the first fully working (besides gps) aries releases and runs on Jellybean 4.2.2.  It is based on the CyanogenMod project.
