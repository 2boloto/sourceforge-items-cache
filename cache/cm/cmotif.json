The discovery of phosphorylation motifs is a very valuable work in bioinformatics. Although several algorithms have been proposed to uncover phosphorylation motifs, the problem of efficiently discovering a set of significant motifs with sufficiently high coverage and non-redundancy still remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called C-Motif for a non-redundant identification of significant phosphorylation motifs. In tests with real data including both non-kinase-specific and kinase-specific phosphorylation data, the C-Motif algorithm successfully reports a relatively complete set of of conditional phosphorylation motifs efficiently.
