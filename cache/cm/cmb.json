There is no central administrative authority to decide who deserves to be trusted and who does not. Because of this, CMB can scale-up very well, so that local communities can be seamlessly aggregated into larger ones.\r\n\r\nAnother way of seeing CMB is as a partnership of independent Local Exchange Trading Systems, having a common marketplace for exchanging one LETS-currency for another (via circular trade).\r\n", "shortname": "cmb", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 268586}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Demo", "mount_point": "link", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cmb/", "video_url": ""}
