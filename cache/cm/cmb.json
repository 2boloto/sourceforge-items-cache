There is no central administrative authority to decide who deserves to be trusted and who does not. Because of this, CMB can scale-up very well, so that local communities can be seamlessly aggregated into larger ones.\r\n\r\nAnother way of seeing CMB is as a partnership of independent Local Exchange Trading Systems, having a common marketplace for exchanging one LETS-currency for another (via circular trade).\r\n", "summary": "", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 268586, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "link", "name": "link", "label": "Demo"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cmb", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/epandurski/", "username": "epandurski", "name": "Evgeni Pandurski"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/woodgold/", "username": "woodgold", "name": "Cathy Woodgold"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cmb/screenshot/280733.jpg", "caption": "Maintaining your shopping list", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cmb/screenshot/280733.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "https://www.multiswap.net/about/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "id": 12}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "fullname": "Python", "shortname": "python", "id": 178}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PL/SQL", "fullname": "PL/SQL", "shortname": "plsql", "id": 254}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "id": 197}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: Python Database API", "fullname": "Python Database API", "shortname": "db_python", "id": 506}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "fullname": "PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "shortname": "db_net_pgsql", "id": 525}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise", "fullname": "Enterprise", "shortname": "enterprise", "id": 576}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Financial", "fullname": "Financial", "shortname": "financial", "id": 75}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Manufacturing", "fullname": "Manufacturing", "shortname": "manufacturing", "id": 365}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Bulgarian", "fullname": "Bulgarian", "shortname": "bulgarian", "id": 328}], "os": []}}
