The benefits of such an approach are evident, since the time taken from design to analysis is greatly reduced leading to large savings in cost and time for industry. The tight coupling of CAD and analysis within IGA requires knowledge from both fields and it is one of the goals of the MIGFEM is to provide a simple-to-understand IGA FEM code. \r\n\r\nThe work is funded under the Framework Programme 7 Initial Training Network Funding under grant number 289361 'Integrating Numerical Simulation and Geometric Design Technology.'  \r\n\r\nIt was started when the author, Dr. Vinh Phu Nguyen, was in Delft University of Technology and the Johns Hopkins University.
