The most commonly cited explanation for the processes underlying gene amplification is the  the repeated fusion and breakage of chromosomes following the loss of a telomere. However, this proposition has never been fully investigated. Using BFBsimulator, we can ask: i) Can the complex patterns of amplification within cancer genomes really be generated by BFB cycles? ii) What visible effect might BFB cycles have on tumour copy number profiles? iii) Is there a specific copy number \u2018signature\u2019 of evolution though breakage fusion bridge cycles? iv) What is the prevalence of BFB cycling across different cancers?", "shortname": "bfbsimulator", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Simulate the structural and copy number consequences of BFB", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 652631}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bfbsimulator/", "video_url": ""}
