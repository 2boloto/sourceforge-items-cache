Current tools enable to analyze next generation sequencing data in various methods. However, there is still need for  fast, easy to use and efficacious tools. We provide an efficient filtering tool for next generation sequencing data produced by genetic disease studies. FMFilter allows to choose one of the inheritance models (recessive, dominant, compound heterozygous and de novo), the affected and control individuals to design the filtering mechanism. It provides an environment of analyzing these cases by removing the requirement of advanced computer techniques. It has the capability to filter with control individuals and eliminate the majority of the false alarms specific to a population. It requires negligible memory which enables to handle very large variant files in ordinary computers.", "shortname": "fmfilter", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Fast Model Based Variant Filtering Tool", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2453294}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fmfilter/", "video_url": null}
