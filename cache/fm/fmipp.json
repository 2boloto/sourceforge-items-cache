On the one hand, this increases flexibility in use and portability to virtually any platform. On the other hand, such a low-level approach implies several prerequisites a simulation tool has to fulfill in order to be able to utilize such an FMI component.\r\n\r\nThe FMI++ library addresses this problem for models and tools with interfaces according to the FMI specification by providing high-level functionalities, which ease the handling and manipulation of such models and tools. Furthermore, the FMI++ library provides utilities to implement FMI-compliant interfaces for a large class of simulation tools.\r\n\r\nThe FMI++ library intends to bridge the gap between the basic FMI specifications and the typical requirements of simulation tools.
