The system creates a file mapping object (also known as a section object) to maintain this association. A file view is the portion of virtual address space that a process uses to access the file's contents. File mapping allows the process to use both random input and output (I/O) and sequential I/O. It also allows the process to work efficiently with a large data file, such as a database, without having to map the whole file into memory. Multiple processes can also use memory-mapped files to share data.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fmstream", "_id": "5071dc151be1ce25119637f2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1002320, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Read-write access to memory-mapped files on Windows and POSIX systems", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Filesystems", "shortname": "filesystems", "fullname": "Filesystems", "id": 142}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
