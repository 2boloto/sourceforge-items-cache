It is mainly used in the verification or synthesis of cyber-physical systems where the system model is nonlinear. The tool also supports specifications in assume-guarantee style.\r\n\r\nThe underlying algorithm is based on a translation to Bernstein polynomials, and several optimization techniques are implemented to ensure efficiency. Concerning performance, the tool enables to check all examples in the PVS Bernstein testsuite within a second, which can be an order of magnitude faster than some other tools such as QEPCAD or REDLOG.\r\n\r\nAlthough JBernstein uses double, it offers automatic error-estimation capabilities (experimental) so that the generated result is correct (the solver may return unknown when the error-estimate is too large)", "shortname": "jbernstein", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "JBernstein: Exploration techniques for non-linear constraint checking", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1207572}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jbernstein/", "video_url": ""}
