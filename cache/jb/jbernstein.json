It is mainly used in the verification or synthesis of cyber-physical systems where the system model is nonlinear. The tool also supports specifications in assume-guarantee style.\r\n\r\nThe underlying algorithm is based on a translation to Bernstein polynomials, and several optimization techniques are implemented to ensure efficiency. Concerning performance, the tool enables to check all examples in the PVS Bernstein testsuite within a second, which can be an order of magnitude faster than some other tools such as QEPCAD or REDLOG.\r\n\r\nAlthough JBernstein uses double, it offers automatic error-estimation capabilities (experimental) so that the generated result is correct (the solver may return unknown when the error-estimate is too large)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jbernstein", "_id": "50e3f68c04161f4e041be89c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1207572, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "JBernstein: Exploration techniques for non-linear constraint checking", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Algorithms", "shortname": "algorithms", "fullname": "Algorithms", "id": 620}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics", "shortname": "mathematics", "fullname": "Mathematics", "id": 98}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Embedded systems", "shortname": "embedded", "fullname": "Embedded systems", "id": 749}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java SWT", "shortname": "ui_swt", "fullname": "Java SWT", "id": 472}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Aerospace", "shortname": "aerospace", "fullname": "Aerospace", "id": 599}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "id": 202}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
