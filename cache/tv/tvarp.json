If you are interested in using it please let me know.  Currently it is designed for use with the SIMA-VS502 video switch, and I am using it in our local TV Station.  There are changes that need to be made to the source code to be able to use it elsewhere.   I am considering moving to using the ATEM switchers for playback in HD.", "shortname": "tvarp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 392343}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "link", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tvarp/", "video_url": null}
