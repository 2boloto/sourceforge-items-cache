It does not correctly handle a FIN ACK message paired with a FIN Output message (it treats the pair as single FIN ACK messages, basically ignoring the FIN Output message).\r\n\r\nThis utility aims to solve the above problems by acting as a converter/preprocessor for FlexCube.\r\n\r\nOther back-office applications might also find this useful.", "shortname": "rjeflexcubizer", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Convert Alliance Access RJE files to FlexCube compatible format", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 868216}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rjeflexcubizer/", "video_url": ""}
