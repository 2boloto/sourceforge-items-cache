The databased tables are viewed as files but in a specific format: All table entries are converted into lines in a file of text. Columns are separated by tab, so all the data of the table is in a tab-delimited text file. The file format is a form of CSV format. The table header is in the first line of the file. It is a tab-delimited line containing the name and some type-properties of each column. The file system sql2textfs relies on the `retranse`  - a language based on regular expressions - project which was developed at the same time. The configuration file of sql2textfs, which is written in retranse, is essential since much of the convertion functionality lies there and each database type requires a special configuration file.", "shortname": "sql2textfs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "a FUSE filesystem for mounting database tables as text files", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1277116}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sql2textfs/", "video_url": ""}
