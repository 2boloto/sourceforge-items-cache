Simply place a placard near your printer telling users the code that you have assigned to the printer and all of your employees, contractors and visitors can print from their iPhones, BlackBerry, Android or Windows phones or from virtually any device or computer that is capable of sending email.\r\n\r\nI developed this initially back in 2009 and have made a few changes along the way.
