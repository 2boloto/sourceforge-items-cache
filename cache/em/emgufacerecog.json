The reason that face recognition is so popular is not only it\u2019s real world application but also the common use of principle component analysis (PCA). PCA is an ideal method for recognising statistical patterns in data. The popularity of face recognition is the fact a user can apply a method easily and see if it is working without needing to know to much about how the process is working.
