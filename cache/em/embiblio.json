Embiblio servers store and distribute Chords.  Neurok takes Chords and turns them into neural networks, who reference an Embiblio database.\r\n\r\nPeople might like to use Chords to communicate concepts more effectively to other people.  With a GenieBulb's (a mapping to WebServices), Chords can also be used to automate GUI routines that users find themselves doing frequently.  Machines might also appreciate the abstraction level provided in Embiblio Chords, as in it's provision-- a metaphor to neurology.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to help out in anyway feel free to drop a line.
