Using a new numerical method, EmCAD computes an equivalent circuit that is fully representative of the electromagnetic bahaviour of the microwave device. This kind data is more flexible than the response curves provided by most other electromagnetic simulators.\r\nThe equivalent circuit is granted to be passive and causal and can be used to perform several kind of analyses both in the time and in the frequency domain.\r\nThe generated circuit can also be exploited, in example, for the computation of the complex zeros and poles associated with the scattering parameters. These data play an important role in the design/tuning of microwave filters but can not be easily extracted from the response curves generated by other full wave simulators.
