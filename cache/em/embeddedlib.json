The \"Embedded Firmware Library\" is a project which offers a kind of API to control the controller-functions and the functions of the peripheral units on a certain board. As an application developer, you don't have to know anything about the registers of the controller. And you can write controller- and board-independent code. In principle, another developer can use your code without modifications on his board and with his favorite controller.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "embeddedlib", "_id": "508a5e2c0594ca7b3f03eebf", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1043281, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Library for typical microcontroller- and peripheral functions", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Hardware", "shortname": "hardware", "fullname": "Hardware", "id": 146}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Hardware :: Hardware Drivers", "shortname": "drivers", "fullname": "Hardware Drivers", "id": 292}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "id": 16}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
