The \"Embedded Firmware Library\" is a project which offers a kind of API to control the controller-functions and the functions of the peripheral units on a certain board. As an application developer, you don't have to know anything about the registers of the controller. And you can write controller- and board-independent code. In principle, another developer can use your code without modifications on his board and with his favorite controller.", "shortname": "embeddedlib", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Library for typical microcontroller- and peripheral functions", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1043281}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/embeddedlib/", "video_url": ""}
