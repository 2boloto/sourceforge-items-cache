Consists of an application to represent the employees of an organization in a graphic map according to personal skills, using their evaluations on the different competences which the company needs.\r\n\r\nThis software generates a graphical representation of the employees in a 2D map of coordinates, that pojects each worker as a figure in the map. The geometric characteristics of each one of these shapes will tell us how are the skills of the employee represented, and it is shown in a simple and visual mode. Furthermore, each employee is placed according to his/her knowledge allowing thus an easy detection of groups with similar profiles segmenting heterogeneous groups and perceiving employees\u2019 skills evolutions during a given period of time.\r\n\r\nThe principal contribution of this project is to allow the human resources manager use vague data, that is data associated with a degree of uncertain.\r\n\r\n(More details on wiki page)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "empl-prof-view", "_id": "5107de6224b0d96ac73e1ea8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1260964, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
