Consists of an application to represent the employees of an organization in a graphic map according to personal skills, using their evaluations on the different competences which the company needs.\r\n\r\nThis software generates a graphical representation of the employees in a 2D map of coordinates, that pojects each worker as a figure in the map. The geometric characteristics of each one of these shapes will tell us how are the skills of the employee represented, and it is shown in a simple and visual mode. Furthermore, each employee is placed according to his/her knowledge allowing thus an easy detection of groups with similar profiles segmenting heterogeneous groups and perceiving employees\u2019 skills evolutions during a given period of time.\r\n\r\nThe principal contribution of this project is to allow the human resources manager use vague data, that is data associated with a degree of uncertain.\r\n\r\n(More details on wiki page)", "shortname": "empl-prof-view", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1260964}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/empl-prof-view/", "video_url": ""}
