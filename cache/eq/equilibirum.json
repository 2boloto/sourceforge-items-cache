It is made using the RPG Maker VX Ace and at the moment is still using a lot of stock sprites but I have been working on changing some of them. The game takes place in a world called Gaia and you are an adventurer that has set out to save it. After you wake up in the forest you quickly make a friend and you are thrown into battle. This game uses class systems and game mechanics to make this a very challenging game at times. There are optional dungeons and side quests that you can do as well as a lengthy story line that takes you all across the land of Gaia. \r\n\r\nRight now this is just the demo of the game but it can give you an idea of what is to come. This demo takes you through the first 3 bosses in the game and has an optional dungeon.
