Currently it is still under development though all the basic functionalities (compiling, resolution) are working. As far as I know this is the only open source Java based implementation out there that does not simplify Warren's design. \r\n\r\nI have done some comparison's with other Java based Prolog engine's and jWAM does seem to outperform them all quite well (tuProlog, JLog, JIP, jTrolog). However, if you need a Java based Prolog engine for your project I recommend tuProlog and jTrolog as they are at the moment way more mature than jWAM.\r\n\r\nMost notable to-do's: \r\n- Built-in predicates.\r\n- Debugging tools.\r\n- Testing.\r\n- Documentation and commenting.\r\n- Android port. (I have the engine working with a test app but I still need to build a proper app). \r\n- Alpha release", "shortname": "jwam", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A 100% Java Warren Abstract Machine implementation.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1897626}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jwam/", "video_url": ""}
