This contains 100% of the data in a standard kdbx file, and is encrypted\r\nusing exactly the same compression, cryptography and integrity code. The difference is that\r\ninside the encrypted container, rather than XML, is a binary format serialized using Protocol\r\nBuffers. This has the advantage of being smaller and faster than XML, and is therefore particularly\r\nsuitable for use with mobile versions of KeePass, such as Keepass2Android <http://keepass2android.codeplex.com/>.\r\n\r\nNote that as this is a new file format, the KdbpFile plugin is required for desktop KeePass to be\r\nable to import files that have been exported using it. Other ports and implementations of KeePass\r\nmay in the future include native support for the format, but if they do not, they will not be\r\nable to read these files.", "shortname": "kdbpfile", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A plugin to allow Import and Export in Fast KDBP format", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1888224}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kdbpfile/", "video_url": ""}
