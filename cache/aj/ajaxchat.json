If they click user 2's name it pops up accept or cancel buttons for user 2. Once they click accept a chat box appears instead of the list of users you can chat with. It only allows you to chat with 1 person at a time. Later we could allow you to chat with more than 1 person in a chat box or more than 1 chat box at a time like gmail. It also allows you to upload a file which shows up as a link for the user you are talking with. The file gets uploaded to the mysql database as a blob. Ajax checks for new messages once each second. When the user stops chatting all the messages and files uploaded gets removed from the database from that session.", "summary": "Chat application using MySQL, PHP and Javascript", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 795558, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ajaxchat", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/stokescomp/", "username": "stokescomp", "name": "michael stokes"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/register.png", "caption": "Register page", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/register.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/chat_list.png", "caption": "Chat list after logging in", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/chat_list.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/home.png", "caption": "The home page", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/home.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/chat_screen.png", "caption": "Chat session and the upload", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/chat_screen.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/request_chat.png", "caption": "Chat request screen", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/request_chat.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/ajaxchat_scheme_workbench.png", "caption": "Ajaxchat Scheme Workbench file", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ajaxchat/screenshot/ajaxchat_scheme_workbench.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "id": 868}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "fullname": "MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "id": 524}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: Chat", "fullname": "Chat", "shortname": "chat", "id": 22}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}]}}
