It disables LanSchool if you need it to. It can be hidden if a teacher is walking by. You can change the title name so that teachers will think that you're on another website/program when you're really on TwitterInSchool. It's very basic to use and updates will be made frequently. It was made in Visual Basic 2008 using various components on it. LanSchool Liberator WAS NOT made by me! I got it from YouTube. I just implemented it into the program. I do NOT deserve any credit on disabling LanSchool. TwitterInSchool is a stealthy program that saves settings that you have put on it. Currently, the only setting that you have is disabling LanSchool. Share this program on Facebook/Twitter for all the people to know.\r\nDO NOT TAKE CREDIT ON THIS ON YOURSELF. THIS PROGRAM IS MADE BY ME, YoungDragon, and I do not like it if you take my work and take it off as your own.\r\n", "shortname": "twitterinschool", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Go on Twitter in school!", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 725694}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/twitterinschool/", "video_url": ""}
