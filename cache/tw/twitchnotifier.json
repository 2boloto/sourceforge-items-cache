The idea I had when I was creating this was to make something that does the job using as little attention, space, and processing power as possible.", "shortname": "twitchnotifier", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Notifies you when people that you are following start streaming.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 777954}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/twitchnotifier/", "video_url": ""}
