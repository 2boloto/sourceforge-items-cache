Virtual Reality is not a virtual world, nor a stand-alone application, it is a scalable and customizable platform containing some basic modules and based on some fundamental innovative pillars (peer-to-peer architecture, secure communication infrastructure, leg\r\nal framework, powerful scripting language); additional modules can be built on top of it on demand.\r\n\r\nThe core of Virtual Reality is the innovative Virtual Reality Engine based on a hybrid peer-to-peer infrastructure that allows the sharing of computational load in experiencing the virtual environment obtaining infrastructural resource optimization and bandwidth reduction. It enhances the platform in terms of robustness, availability, scalability, load balancing.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vrsoftware", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/vrenterprises/", "username": "vrenterprises", "name": "Virtual Reality"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.virtualrealitygrid.org"}
