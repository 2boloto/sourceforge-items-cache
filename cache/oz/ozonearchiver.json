O3 Archiver is distributed under the GPL license. The program was originally dsigned to be used on a Raspberry Pi computer for low-power uninterrupted 24/7 data monitoring and archival of the 2B Technologies ozone monitoring information with application to the NASA Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) project. The program provides a convenient way of displaying and saving the incoming mixing ratio and related parameters.  In addition to the Raspberry Pi, the source code may be compiled to be used under other platforms such as Linux, Mac, or Windows.  An SD image for Raspberry Pi is provided in addition to the source code.", "shortname": "ozonearchiver", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Read, display and save data from the 2B Technologies ozone monitor", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2341045}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ozonearchiver/", "video_url": null}
