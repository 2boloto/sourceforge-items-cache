It is called \"eeef\" because it uses GLEW and GLFW, and I just find the \"E\" in GLEW and \"F\" in GLFW are so cute. So I decide make a name with \"E\" and \"F\". \"ee\" and \"ef\" just refers the pronunciation of \"E\" and \"F\".\r\n\r\nI want this project to be a test-field of my computer graphics knowledge and some new ideas. And a platform to communicate with computer graphics gurus(hope so).\r\n\r\nIf it interests you, please contact me: racnil@yahoo.com.cn", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "eeef-ge", "_id": "4fbac483b9363c7acc0000b7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 775943, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Just another graphics engine try", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
