It is called \"eeef\" because it uses GLEW and GLFW, and I just find the \"E\" in GLEW and \"F\" in GLFW are so cute. So I decide make a name with \"E\" and \"F\". \"ee\" and \"ef\" just refers the pronunciation of \"E\" and \"F\".\r\n\r\nI want this project to be a test-field of my computer graphics knowledge and some new ideas. And a platform to communicate with computer graphics gurus(hope so).\r\n\r\nIf it interests you, please contact me: racnil@yahoo.com.cn", "shortname": "eeef-ge", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Just another graphics engine try", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 775943}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/eeef-ge/", "video_url": ""}
