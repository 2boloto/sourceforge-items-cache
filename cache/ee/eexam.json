The middle-ware will be released as open source too.\r\nA number of modes are possible including a paper equivalent mode (where keyboard input is optional for exam candidates), paper replacement mode (that can integrate methods and tools not possible in paper based exams), an on-board LMS to enable computer marked question types and access to a remote (institutional) LMS via a restricted connection. \r\nPlease note this is an alpha standard demo, you are advised not to use it production systems.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "eexam", "_id": "526d1381f1fd8d3811986132", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1991663, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A scalable examination platform for BYOD invigilated assessment", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
