The software platform uses a combination of open source components such as Ubuntu Linux, LibreOffice, Apache, MySQL, PhP and the Moodle LMS along with some custom middle-ware to tie it together to form the secure eExam environment. The middle-ware will be released as open source too.\r\nA number of modes are possible including a paper equivalent mode (where keyboard input is optional for exam candidates), paper replacement mode (that can integrate methods and tools not possible in paper based exams), an on-board LMS to enable computer marked question types and access to a remote (institutional) LMS via a restricted connection. \r\nPlease note this is an alpha standard demo, you are advised not to use it production systems.", "shortname": "eexam", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A scalable examination platform for BYOD invigilated assessment", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1991663}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/eexam/", "video_url": ""}
