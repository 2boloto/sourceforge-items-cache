Thus, using the defined format better protects student privacy and independence than does current practice.  Because transcripts are digitally signed by the originating school official, transcript recipients can independently verify that transcripts received directly from students have not been altered in transit.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "eesst", "_id": "5128d9461be1ce19b33ad9cc", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1306217, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Email Exchange of Secondary School Transcripts", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: Email", "shortname": "email", "fullname": "Email", "id": 28}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
