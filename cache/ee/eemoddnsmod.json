I will read all the suggestions but I cannot promise that I will include all of them. Every new part of the code will contain the name of the author. If someone contributes improving the capabilities of this model in a substantial way, I will include that person as  co-author of the model in the next version release. I hope this will promote people to contribute. Of course, fixing bugs or minor changes will also be mentioned with the corresponding author.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.
