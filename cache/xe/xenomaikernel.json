Similar to that project, here I maintain xenomai real-time kernel images that can be installed as debian packages. These images have been created through the generic configuration provided by Ubuntu 12.04 so they are not vendor specific. They can be installed simply by dpkg -i and they come with a pre-installed initrd ramfs so you don't have to generate a new one. Just like it's sister project we don't need any actual code uploaded in the repositories because all the linux kernel and xenomai code is available to public. See the downloads for the images and the corrosponding header files. \r\n\r\n[1] https://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuntugrsec/", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xenomaikernel", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kernlogger/", "username": "kernlogger", "name": "Vikram Dhillon"}], "external_homepage": ""}
