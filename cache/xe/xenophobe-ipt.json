The solution exists via iptables and the geoIP database done via cmd-line. \r\n\r\nI have begun to make a simple web gui, that allows for selecting countries one would like to simply block from reaching one's server. The gui incorporates country flags as a means of selection.\r\n\r\nEventually, this project seeks to be able to apply fine tailored restrictions, via port and protocols to firewall rules.\r\n\r\nWith help, I intend to port this to Windows in the near future.", "shortname": "xenophobe-ipt", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Block countries via iptables and gui menu with country flags.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 840751}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/xenophobe-ipt/", "video_url": ""}
