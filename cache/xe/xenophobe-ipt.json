The solution exists via iptables and the geoIP database done via cmd-line. \r\n\r\nI have begun to make a simple web gui, that allows for selecting countries one would like to simply block from reaching one's server. The gui incorporates country flags as a means of selection.\r\n\r\nEventually, this project seeks to be able to apply fine tailored restrictions, via port and protocols to firewall rules.\r\n\r\nWith help, I intend to port this to Windows in the near future.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xenophobe-ipt", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jfer-xeno/", "username": "jfer-xeno", "name": "jfer0x01"}], "external_homepage": ""}
