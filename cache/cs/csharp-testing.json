This is similar to the language name of C++, where \"++\" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1.\r\nDue to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol (U+266F \u266f music sharp sign (HTML: &#9839;)) is not present on the standard keyboard, the number sign (U+0023 # number sign (HTML: &#35;)) was chosen to represent the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language. This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification. However, when it is practical to do so (for example, in advertising or in box art), Microsoft uses the intended musical symbol.", "shortname": "csharp-testing", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "C# is a multi-paradigm programming language.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1998315}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/csharp-testing/", "video_url": ""}
