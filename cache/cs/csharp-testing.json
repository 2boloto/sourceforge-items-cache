This is similar to the language name of C++, where \"++\" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1.\r\nDue to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol (U+266F \u266f music sharp sign (HTML: &#9839;)) is not present on the standard keyboard, the number sign (U+0023 # number sign (HTML: &#35;)) was chosen to represent the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language. This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification. However, when it is practical to do so (for example, in advertising or in box art), Microsoft uses the intended musical symbol.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "csharp-testing", "_id": "527781af1be1ce2c34253790", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1998315, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "C# is a multi-paradigm programming language.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
