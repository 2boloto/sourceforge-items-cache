It has all the features that CTruck3D has but it is much like GTA 3 ... can get on-off the vehicle, and one can climb on stunt-structures, and there are buildings on which one can jump. As soon as possible I wish to put more structures, and do better climb-on simulation. Of course heightmap is editable, a 300x300 one, and also the color map is editable so one can draw nice roads... also the position of stunt-structures in easily editable. Have lots of fun! \r\nSoon more cars and better textured terrain should be available... maybe also in-game terrain editing possiblity.\r\nComments or suggestions are appreciated.\r\n\r\ncompiled for Windows too (XP, 32 bit), it is in the folder \"windows_ver_XP\" ", "shortname": "cstunts", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "remake of the classic STUNTS game, but more realistic; more like GTA 3", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 862904}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/", "video_url": ""}
