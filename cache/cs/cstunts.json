It has all the features that CTruck3D has but it is much like GTA 3 ... can get on-off the vehicle, and one can climb on stunt-structures, and there are buildings on which one can jump. As soon as possible I wish to put more structures, and do better climb-on simulation. Of course heightmap is editable, a 300x300 one, and also the color map is editable so one can draw nice roads... also the position of stunt-structures in easily editable. Have lots of fun! \r\nSoon more cars and better textured terrain should be available... maybe also in-game terrain editing possiblity.\r\nComments or suggestions are appreciated.\r\n\r\ncompiled for Windows too (XP, 32 bit), it is in the folder \"windows_ver_XP\" ", "summary": "remake of the classic STUNTS game, but more realistic; more like GTA 3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 862904, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cstunts", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ctrucker/", "username": "ctrucker", "name": "Simon Hasur"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/Screenshot.png", "caption": "physics", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/Screenshot.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/Screenshot-1.png", "caption": "unlimited stunts", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/Screenshot-1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/Screenshot-4.png", "caption": "driving on a highway", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/Screenshot-4.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/Screenshot-3.png", "caption": "climbing on structures", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/Screenshot-3.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/screenshot_working_on_Win_XP.JPG", "caption": "working on Windows XP ", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cstunts/screenshot/screenshot_working_on_Win_XP.JPG/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "www.simonhasurgaming.altervista.org", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: SDL", "fullname": "SDL", "shortname": "ui_sdl", "id": 480}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: GLUT", "fullname": "GLUT", "shortname": "ui_glut", "id": 490}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "id": 80}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Simulation", "fullname": "Simulation", "shortname": "simulation", "id": 85}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Sports", "fullname": "Sports", "shortname": "sports", "id": 806}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "fullname": "Education", "shortname": "education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Automotive", "fullname": "Automotive", "shortname": "automotive", "id": 768}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (95/98)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (95/98)", "shortname": "win95", "id": 218}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
