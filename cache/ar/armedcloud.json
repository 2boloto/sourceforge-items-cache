It is designed as a distributed agent based resource management system, that includes advanced algorithms to provide an intuitive method for the cloud operators to handle the heterogeneous physical hosts in the cloud. Highly scalable by design and simple enough to understand and get started even for small private clouds, ARMS aims to be the best of its kind of tools available freely.\r\n\r\nARMS has a well researched design as its foundation. Working prototype implementation is ready. ARMS uses the powerful libvirt library (http://libvirt.org) for hypervisor agnostic VM  management. The fully functional prototype is implemented in Qt so that it can support all popular operating system", "summary": "Advanced Resource Management System for Clouds", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1426206, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "armedcloud", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/arunash/", "username": "arunash", "name": "Arun T Anand"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/armedcloud/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "fullname": "Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "id": 479}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "id": 15}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "fullname": "MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "id": 524}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: SQLite", "fullname": "SQLite", "shortname": "db_net_sqlite", "id": 531}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Algorithms", "fullname": "Algorithms", "shortname": "algorithms", "id": 620}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Distributed Computing", "fullname": "Distributed Computing", "shortname": "distributed_computing", "id": 308}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence :: Intelligent Agents", "fullname": "Intelligent Agents", "shortname": "intelligent_agents", "id": 591}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "fullname": "Architects", "shortname": "architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "fullname": "WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Virtualization", "fullname": "Virtualization", "shortname": "virtualization", "id": 664}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Virtualization :: VMware", "fullname": "VMware", "shortname": "vmware", "id": 665}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Virtualization :: Xen", "fullname": "Xen", "shortname": "xen", "id": 666}]}}
