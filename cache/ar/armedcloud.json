It is designed as a distributed agent based resource management system, that includes advanced algorithms to provide an intuitive method for the cloud operators to handle the heterogeneous physical hosts in the cloud. Highly scalable by design and simple enough to understand and get started even for small private clouds, ARMS aims to be the best of its kind of tools available freely.\r\n\r\nARMS has a well researched design as its foundation. Working prototype implementation is ready. ARMS uses the powerful libvirt library (http://libvirt.org) for hypervisor agnostic VM  management.
