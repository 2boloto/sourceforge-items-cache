IMSA takes input sequence from high throughput datasets and uses a user-defined host database to filter out host sequence.  IMSA then aligns the filtered reads to a user-defined universal database to characterize exogenous reads within the host background.  IMSA assigns a score to each node of the taxonomy based on read frequency, and can output this as a taxonomy report suitable for cluster analysis or as a taxonomy map (TaxMap). IMSA also outputs the specific sequence reads assigned to a taxon of interest for downstream analysis.
