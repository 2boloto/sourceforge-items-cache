It provides large key lengths to allow future growth without the need to change the core algorithm.  The focus is security not speed.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm uses up to 256 (initial) individual keys of 256 bits each, which are generated using SHA-256.  The keys are mutated based on plaintext block data that is fed into a simple binary shifting function. Logic gate functions, substitution boxes, and transposition  rounds are also executed in a unique way.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide a simple Windows based software solution for users to employ Archangel for personal use.\r\n\r\nDistribution may be restricted in accordance with U.S. law.  \r\n\r\nA Powerpoint presentation will be made available soon.\r\n\r\nI am an active duty soldier in the U.S. Army so my schedule is very chaotic.
