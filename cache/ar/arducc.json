It supports the CAN bus protocol, includes a GSM modem for tracking purposes, a set of relays for general purpose, a low quiescent current voltage regulator for low current drain of MCU when battery powered, and a switched mode power supply (SMPS) for modem. MCU is an ATMega328P device with several capabilities such as low power AVR 8-Bit micro-controller, three timers, six pulse with modulation (PWM) channels, I2C and SPI bus, wake-up interrupt to wake on CAN, and 8 analog digital converter (ADC) channels.\r\n\r\nArducc has a low consumption segment, and contains two different power supplies allowing the board to have very low current consumption. In this setting, the MCU is switched to power down state, the CAN transceiver to sleep mode, and the SMPS is disabled. The system wakes-up and turns-on the SMPS and the remaining devices when one message is received from the CAN channel.", "shortname": "arducc", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1980289}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/arducc/", "video_url": null}
