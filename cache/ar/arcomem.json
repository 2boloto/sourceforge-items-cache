Throughout the project a large number of components have been developed to collect content from Web and Social Web, to analyse it from semantic and social perspectives and to enable Web archive access by different facets. The whole system based on the Heritrix crawler is released as open source to the public.\r\n\r\nSince many components or composite tools are of interest also for other areas and usage scenarios, the ARCOMEM consortium defined a number of pre-packaged tools which can be used independently from each other. By combining all packages the full ARCOMEM system can be build. The following major packages will be released in the coming weeks as pre-compiled packages with source code.\r\n\r\nSee the wiki for more information.", "summary": "Semantic and social web crawling", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2068185, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "arcomem", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/arcomem/", "username": "arcomem", "name": "John Arcoman"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://www.arcomem.eu/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
