By convention, any new created object is stacked on it.\r\n      - The pStack used for stocking (short lived) results of intermediate computation.\r\n- Macros for stacking data, Marking and Releasing. If I am not mistaken, this would be the Pascal way of doing things.\r\n- Macro for switching to a local stack when need arise.\r\n\r\nAnd that's it.\r\nTh", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "archfundation", "_id": "4eccf9fa1be1ce2dc9000770", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 633766, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Few useful tools that will be liberally used in all my projects.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
