The first version will be playing the classical Gomoku game, and this version is called \"Architect I\". This project also shows the rich features of the next generation Java graphical user interface. The GUI of this application was built using JavaFX 2.0 which was entirely written in Java. Although as been announced, JavaFX 3.0 will be integrated into JRE in next year, at this point, you still need a separate runtime evironment. Be sure to download and install the JavaFX 2.0 runtime before download this game. \r\n\r\n                                                       @2011.10.24", "shortname": "architect1", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Gomoku Game: Playing with Computer", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 612311}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/architect1/", "video_url": ""}
