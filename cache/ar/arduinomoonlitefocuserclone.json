It supports Moonlite focuser  protocol with the following improvement and limitation.\r\n- Using AccelStepper library, to provide speed acceleration and deacceleration, to avoid slippage. There is no noticeable slippage at highest speed. At contrast, Moonlite focuser slips even at lowest speed.\r\n- Provide 0.125 degree temperature reading accuracy, as opposed to 0.5. Clone also provides compatibility mode.  \r\n- Hardware controlled TempComp (Moonlite uses driver), with programable trigger (temperature drop).\r\n- TempComp only tracks temperature drop. When temperature goes up over hysteresis limit (which should be very rare), it will report an error.\r\n- HALT command is implemented but it does not stop focuser right away, instead it will move some time more (depending on the speed).", "shortname": "arduinomoonlitefocuserclone", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Arduino Nano based Moonlite focuser controller", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2455915}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/arduinomoonlitefocuserclone/", "video_url": null}
