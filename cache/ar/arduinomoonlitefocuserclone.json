It supports Moonlite focuser  protocol with the following improvement and limitation.\r\n- Using AccelStepper library, to provide speed acceleration and deacceleration, to avoid slippage. There is no noticeable slippage at highest speed. At contrast, Moonlite focuser slips even at lowest speed.\r\n- Provide 0.125 degree temperature reading accuracy, as opposed to 0.5. Clone also provides compatibility mode.  \r\n- Hardware controlled TempComp (Moonlite uses driver), with programable trigger (temperature drop).\r\n- TempComp only tracks temperature drop. When temperature goes up over hysteresis limit (which should be very rare), it will report an error.\r\n- HALT command is implemented but it does not stop focuser right away, instead it will move some time more (depending on the speed).", "summary": "Arduino Nano based Moonlite focuser controller", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2455915, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "arduinomoonlitefocuserclone", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/blackdragon72/", "username": "blackdragon72", "name": "yanzhe liu"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://arduinomoonlitefocuserclone.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
