So, for example if you take the first 2,000 \r\n words, there is a good chance that you'll find more than half of them fit to include in a dictionary. \r\n Proper names are not filtered out because high frequency proper names are usually included in morphological \r\n analysers to improve coverage, but in dictionaries people might want to exclude them.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "arabic-unknowns", "_id": "4f6aa99bb9363c5827001085", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 728679, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Arabic Unknown Words, or words not included in Buckwalter Morphology", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
