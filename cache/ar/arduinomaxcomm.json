You will need an Arduino board connected via the serial port to your PC running Processing.\r\n\r\nWhen using the library, your sketch will be enabled with a what is called a handshake protocol ment for identifying the maximum serial bandwidth and response time. Once the handshake between Arduino and the PC is accomplished, your sketch can behave transparently with the PC app without further handshake intervention.\r\n\r\nThe Arduino Max Comm contains two libraries, one for the Arduino board to be called from your sketch, and the other for the Processing sketch running in your PC.\r\n\r\nWhen using Arduino Max Comm, your sketch will first attempt to identify if your Processing sketch is using as well the Arduino Max Comm, otherwise it will disable and turn control back to your sketch. If Max Comm handshake was found in the PC, a negotiation begins between the two in order to maximize response time and band with.
