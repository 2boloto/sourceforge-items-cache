It is basically dansguardian rewritten in python as an ICAP server as opposed to a proxy front-end. The benefits of archangel over dansguardian include:\r\n\r\n1. Because it is an ICAP filter, it interfaces with squid and can do HTTPS filtering as well as regular HTTP.\r\n2. Because it uses blocking modules and is written in python, it is extremely easy to write new modules for very complex, intensive blocking. I have already written a module that does content-based blocking of youtube videos.\r\n\r\nArchangel uses the pyicap library to implement the ICAP functionality. The blockpage requires use of the PHP 5.4.x CLI. In order to do HTTPS filtering, you must first install squid compiled with SSL support and configure it to talk to archangel.", "summary": "A flexible, extendable content filter", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2289377, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "archangelfilter", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/justinschw/", "username": "justinschw", "name": "Justin Schwartzbeck"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://archangelfilter.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "id": 8}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "id": 460}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "fullname": "Python", "shortname": "python", "id": 178}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "id": 15}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "fullname": "Security", "shortname": "security", "id": 43}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP", "fullname": "WWW/HTTP", "shortname": "www", "id": 90}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking :: Monitoring", "fullname": "Monitoring", "shortname": "monitoring", "id": 152}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "fullname": "Education", "shortname": "education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Religion", "fullname": "Religion", "shortname": "religion", "id": 366}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}]}}
