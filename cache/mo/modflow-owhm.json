While maintaining compatibility with existing MF versions, MF-OWHM includes: linkages for coupled heads, flows, and deformation; facilitation of self-updating models, additional observation and parameter options for higher-order calibrations; and redesigned code for faster simulations. MF-OWHM represents a complete IHM that fully links the movement and use of groundwater, surface water, and imported water for consumption by agriculture and natural vegetation on the landscape, and for potable and other uses. This provides the foundation needed to address integrated hydrologic problems such as evaluation of conjunctive-use alternatives, sustainability analysis, including potential adaptation and mitigation strategies, and best management practices.", "shortname": "modflow-owhm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simulation, analysis, and management of the movement of water", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2338552}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "USGS MF-OWHM Report", "mount_point": "report", "name": "link"}, {"label": "MF-OWHM Online Guide and Input Reference", "mount_point": "mf-owhm-guide", "name": "link"}, {"label": "OWHM Official Website", "mount_point": "usgs-owhm-homepage", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/modflow-owhm/", "video_url": null}
