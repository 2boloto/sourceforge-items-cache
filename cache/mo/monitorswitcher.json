Along the monitor state and setup (right, left, extended, disabled) the resolution is also saved and restored.\r\n\r\nThe program works by saving a current monitor setup as configured using the windows control panel to an xml file. Once saved the configuration can be quickly restored at any time. Requires .NET 4.0 Framework to be installed.\r\n\r\nThe program is quite simple and in an early development stage. It is provided without any warranty.
