The focus lies on its ontological approach. Every object in a game is represented by a separate module. These modules share a common interface and can therefore be plugged into other projects effortlessly. A module can have configurable properties, allowing for different configurations of the same module to serve different purposes. Relationships can be defined between different modules to allow for interaction. \r\n\r\nThis approach gives rise to two mail goals within the project. Reusability: as modules have a plug-n-play character, databasing of modules allows for games to be constructed by combining modules rather than constructing new code. Simplicity: all modules share a common shape. Therefore, they allow for visual programming through a simple GUI (comparable to Java Beans). \r\n\r\nThe creation of good games relies on the easy of prototyping and creative exploration.", "shortname": "modularge", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Modular Game Creation Framework.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 775138}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/modularge/", "video_url": ""}
