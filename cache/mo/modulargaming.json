If you wanted just a forum you could enable only the core, user and forum modules.\r\n\r\nWe are building our framework using Kohana which is an open source, object oriented (H)MVC web framework built using PHP5 by a team of volunteers that aims to be swift, secure, and small. We are using Kohana 3.3\r\n\r\nYou can view a demo at http://demo.modulargaming.com\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, bugs or feature requests feel free to post them on the issue tracker at GitHub. https://www.github.com/modulargaming/modulargaming\r\n\r\nLicensed under a BSD license.
