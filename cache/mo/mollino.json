This will be possible by defining a logical structure.\r\n\r\nAs I am an architect, and I know very little about programming, and wouldn't reach even in 10 years the necessary level to be able to write anything useful for this type of software, my part will be to bring ideas and coherence to this project.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know some more : \r\n- go to the blog https://sourceforge.net/p/mollino/blog/\r\n- write me a message ;)\r\n\r\nI speak french, german, english and italian.\r\n\r\nMartin Lucas", "shortname": "mollino", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@mollino3D", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Not your usual Architectural Modeler", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1989491}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mollino/", "video_url": ""}
