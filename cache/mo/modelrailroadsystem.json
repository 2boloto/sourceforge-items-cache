It now supports Azatrax USB-connected Model Railroad Detectors. Software to create switch lists for freight car forwarding and creating timetables for your railroad are included. There is software to help with photographing of your trains and to compute the correct value for those pesky dropping resistors for LEDs and/or incandescent lamps. If you have a model railway, large or small, this software package will help you out.", "shortname": "modelrailroadsystem", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/ModelRailroadSystem", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The Model Railroad System can help you run your railroad.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2365150}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "More File Downloads", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/modelrailroadsystem/", "video_url": null}
