MoveMirror never makes changes to the master directory.\r\n\r\nWhen you make changes to the master directory tree, run MoveMirror to make the same changes to the mirror directory. Unlike other sync programs, it moves files rather than deleting and recopying.\r\n\r\nMoveMirror never deletes any files, nor does it overwrite any files. Old versions of files, or files that should no longer be in the mirror are not lost, they are simply moved to a \"diff\" directory for you to delete later. This makes the program safe to use.\r\n\r\nMoveMirror is a Linux command line program. The first alpha version will be released soon.\r\n", "shortname": "movemirror", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Sync two directories by moving files in the mirror to match the master", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2078019}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/movemirror/", "video_url": ""}
