It is a battle among programmers to test who can build the most intelligent mouse, given limited information during the game.\r\n\r\nProgrammers need only implement one code file, extending from an abstract class that will contain the logic of the individual mouse. The game Host will gather all the mouse implementation and let them run in the maze. It is real fun for geeks/nerds/(or whatever you like to call yourself) like us.\r\n\r\nThis game will be a perfect practice tool for programmers like us to find the best algorithm solutions and make the mouse intelligent. To get information on this game, visit the Mouse Run website at http://mouse-run.appspot.com\r\n\r\nIf you have found bugs or have a request, please do write it in the reviews. Thanks!
