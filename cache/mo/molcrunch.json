It provides Gaussian and Slater orbital support for SCF,\r\nMCSCF, and orthogonal or nonorthogonal orbital CI calculations.\r\n\r\nIts most sophisticated feature is a configuration\r\nmanipulation CI package that provides symmetry filtering, orbital occupation\r\nselection, and a choice of many other wave function and/or basis characteristics. The symmetry filtering includes the ability to deal\r\ndirectly with certain non-Abelian groups as well as all Abelian groups. Linear systems can be treated exactly within the full continuous\r\nD-infinity-h or C-infinity-v groups.\r\n\r\nThe package is completely modular, allowing control over ordering of most steps within the limitations imposed by the theory.  Flow is controled completely by tcsh shell scripts, many of which are provided in the package.\r\nUsers may devise their own scripts, of course.", "shortname": "molcrunch", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An atomic or molecular electronic properties computational package", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 555742}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/molcrunch/", "video_url": ""}
