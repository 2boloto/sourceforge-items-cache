Such rate changes can result from use of adaptive coding and modulation.  The link rate and conditions offered by the modem to connected devices therefore vary.  In order for connected devices and applications to get the most out of the modem's link capacity, it is necessary for the applications and connected devices to condition traffic.  Thus, they need some knowledge of the modem's link conditions.  This PERL script generates packets used to advertise link rate and other characteristics, via UDP messages.
