The main purpose of this package is to employ the MODIS SOAP Web Service to remotely interrogate the MODIS archive and locally download the requested datasets. The most important function is MODISSubsets(), which allows the user to request subsets from a given MODIS product for a specified time-series of a given spatial extent surrounding many locations at a time, greatly reducing time, effort, and human error. These time-series are described by a lat-long coordinate in WGS-1984 coordinate system and a defined time period. Alternatively MODISTransects() expands upon MODISSubsets(), by extracting MODIS data along a transect, and its neighbourhood depending on the spatial extent requested.", "shortname": "modistools", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "R Package for retrieval and processing of MODIS data subsets.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 847266}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/modistools/", "video_url": ""}
