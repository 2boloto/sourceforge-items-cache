MolBioLib is designed to work with common file formats and data types used both in genomic analysis and general data analysis.   A central relational-database-like Table class is a flexible and powerful object to intuitively represent and work with a wide variety of tabular datasets, ranging from alignment data to annotations.  MolBioLib includes programs to perform a wide variety of analysis tasks such as computing read coverage, annotating genomic intervals, and novel peak calling with a wavelet algorithm.  While MolBioLib was designed primarily for bioinformatics purposes, much of its functionality is applicable to a wide range of problems.  Complete documentation and an extensive automated test suite are provided.
