The add-on can import set of motion captured BVH files and construct a motion graph based on some given parameters. This motion graph can be stored in memory and used until Blender is running, or can be baked to a file in a compact format so that it can be retrieved later without the need of re-computation. This motion graph can be used to generate arbitrary length motions that is composed of frames from the original motions and some generated transition frames between them.\r\n\r\nThe add-on is currently being extended for path synthesis where the the animation required to make the character traverse an arbitrary path will be generated from the motion graph.", "shortname": "mograph-blender", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A Blender 2.6+ addon that aims to implement Motion Graphs", "tools": [{"label": "Home (@IITB)", "mount_point": "home-iitb", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Documentation", "mount_point": "documentation", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Code (Stable)", "mount_point": "code-stable", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 563577}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mograph-blender/", "video_url": ""}
