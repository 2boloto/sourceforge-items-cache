This means that an application is working according to its purpose but the control over the whole interface is taken from developer and given to users.

Set of files includes the book (both in DOC and PDF formats), a big demonstration project with all its files available (all the source files are in C#), and an additional description of many used classes.  Book uses the examples from the demo project to explain everything in details.  The examples are from many different areas.  Examples from the first part of the book are aimed at the details of algorithm and its use with different objects; examples from the second part are mostly the real and very useful applications.", "shortname": "movegraph", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 203259}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/movegraph/", "video_url": ""}
