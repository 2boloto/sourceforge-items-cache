The former permit seeding with a key of up to 256 or 512 bits, the latter with a 1024-bit key.\r\n\r\nReduced to essentials, MOTE is only 5 lines of code:  Ten arithmetic and bitwise operations in all. It's called MOTE because a PRNG can't be made much smaller (or faster) without introducing bias or severely reducing avalanche.\r\n\r\nMOTE alternates its shift and rotation constants unpredictably, and has passed the most stringent industry-standard tests for randomness and security, including NIST & DIEHARD.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "mote-csprng-stream-cipher", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A family of small-state CSPRNGs and Stream Ciphers", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2337085}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mote-csprng-stream-cipher/", "video_url": null}
