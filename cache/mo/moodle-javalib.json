One of the important extensions of the platform functionality, starting with version 2.0, is support for Web services. To explore the practical possibilities of interacting with Moodle Web services we have developed a Java-client and used it for the study. Further work in this area has shown the feasibility of developing a client library, which could be used in the Information Systems developed for the Java platform, in order to ensure their interaction with the Moodle platform. The advantage of using such a library is the ability for developers to operate by Moodle objects, such as a course, category, cohort, user, group, etc.in object-orienting programming style. This project aims to engage students in software development for Java platform using modern tools and development tools, as well as project management system.", "shortname": "moodle-javalib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Java client library for Moodle 2.x REST Web Services", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2434475}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/moodle-javalib/", "video_url": null}
