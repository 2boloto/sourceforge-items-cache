You can rotate the molecules by moving your finger across the display, zoom in or out by using two-finger pinch gestures, or pan the molecule by moving two fingers across the screen at once. These structures can be viewed in both ball-and-stick and spacefilling visualization modes.\r\n\r\nNew molecules can be downloaded from either the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb), an international repository of biological molecules and their 3-D structures, or NCBI's PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), a public database of compounds. Molecules can be downloaded directly to your handheld device and stored there for later viewing.\r\n\r\nCustom molecular structures can be downloaded to the application via iTunes file sharing, or through the use of custom URL formats.
