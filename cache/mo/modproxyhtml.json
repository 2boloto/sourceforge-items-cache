It is written in Perl and exceeds all mod_proxy_html.c limitations without performance lost. It is very simple and has far better parsing/replacement of URL than the original C code. It also support meta tag, CSS, and javascript URL rewriting and can be use with compressed HTTP. You can now replace any code by other, like changing images name or anything else. mod_proxy_html can't do all of that. Since release 3.0 ModProxyPerlHtml is also able to rewrite HTTP headers with refresh url redirection. One of the common used of ModProxyPerlHtml is as free replacement for ISA servers.
