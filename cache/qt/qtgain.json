Simply add your files or folders via drag & drop or select a folder with a file dialog. QtGain starts gaining immediately after adding some files and of course you can add more files while QtGain works on your files.\r\nFiles which are already gained and need no recalculating are automatically skipped. Files which cannot processed are automatically listed in a dialog box at the end of the job.\r\nYou can now rename all your folders which contains the files and of course the media files too with QtGain. All you need is to switch on the setting and choose a scheme how the folders/files should be renamed.\r\nIts also possible to download covers for your albums.", "shortname": "qtgain", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2147869}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/qtgain/", "video_url": null}
