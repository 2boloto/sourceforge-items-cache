It has a wide range of applications, in government programs such as national ID cards, use in visas and visa processing, and in the war against terrorism, as well as having personal applications in areas such as logical and physical access control. Iris recognition is the most accurate personal identification biometric and it is this that accounts for its use in identity management in government departments requiring high security.\r\n\r\nIndex Terms: Matlab, source, code, iris, recognition, one to one, one to many, verification, identification, matching.
