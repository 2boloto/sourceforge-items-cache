The scheme is aimed at maximizing the productivity (number of subjects processed per unit time) for the use case of research projects with datasets involving many acquisitions. The scheme combines the already existing GPU-accelerated version of the FS workflow with a task-level parallel scheme supervised by a resource scheduler. This allows for an optimum utilization of the computational power of a given hardware platform while avoiding problems with shortages of platform resources.\r\n\r\nThis software is provided without any warranty and acording to the FreeSurfer License.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "freesurferscheduler", "_id": "5253c8eebcf63a303188edab", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1974497, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
