Strength is a competition of who spends the most computing time trying to associate the texts, similar to Bitcoin's \"proof of work\" system. While there is unlimited space in the system overall, the space around any specific text is limited by 3d space, which drives competition for what people want that text to be associated with. It can be used like a forum or chatroom to associate text with responses, or to associate election candidates names with their positions on the issues, or to associate your website URL with things. Many possible uses, and a global competition for what gets associated to what else. In this peer to peer network, pairs of short text are communicated based on highest \"proof of work\" (see Bitcoin's design doc) on each pair, so the pairs of text that the most time is spent toward associating will spread through the network.", "shortname": "freespeechpay", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "3d peer to peer chatroom where associated pairs of text gravitate", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 331245}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/freespeechpay/", "video_url": ""}
