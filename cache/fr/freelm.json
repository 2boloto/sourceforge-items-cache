The project may eventually incorporate a number of smoothing methods, but initially it will incorporate just one, which is not a standard method.  It's similar in spirit but modified, interpolated Kneser-Ney, but uses the principle that the amount you discount should always be the amount that gets given to the backoff state (which makes the traditional count-of-counts stuff and the associated formulas for obtaining smoothing constants unusuable).  \r\nThis gives slightly better results than KN for standard LM building, but has larger advantages for interpolation and pruning.
