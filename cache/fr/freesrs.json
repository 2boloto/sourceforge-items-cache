Its origin probably dates from civil engineering and the problem of seismic excitations, i.e. earthquake response of buildings, see Clough Penzien 1975. The SRS is a spectrum, i.e. a curve giving the maximum acceleration response depending on frequency. It is derived from a 1-mass-spring-damper vibration system being excited by a base excitation, i.e. an acceleration.\r\n\r\nfreesrs calculates the shock response spectrum (SRS) and is a small library with Python and Fortran files. The Fortran files consist of\r\n  \u2022  SmallwoodFilter.f and\r\n  \u2022  GenShockTimeHistories.f\r\nThey are linked to Python by using the comfortable f2py tool.\r\n\r\nLatest version is 1.1.1, including now the ability to perform a full install via setup.py.", "shortname": "freesrs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "python library for shock response spectrum (SRS) analysis.", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 127604}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "src", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/freesrs/", "video_url": ""}
