It can be integrated into applications for diagnosis. This is especially important in areas like Intesive Care Units where patients' data are handled by a temporal data base.\r\nThe FuzzyTime module is a structure which consists of three levels of abstraction. The upper layer is the user interface where a translator transforms the expressions introduced by the user into temporal relations between temporal entities (points and intervals). The semantic of user\u2019s expressions is analized and stored in the intermediate layer or temporal world.
