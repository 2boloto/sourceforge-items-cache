If your produce buying club meets in person (not online) then this could be a very useful tool for you.  \r\n\r\nOnce you have a wholesale pricelist in .txt format, Fruitarium can automatically import it and generate your custom pricelist.  \r\n\r\nThe product registry gives you permanent control of the names of the products and of which items will/will not show on your custom list.  \r\n\r\nAfter the in-person club meeting, data entry is a snap with very precise and efficient data entry controls.  Once data entry is complete, several reports are available including: individual invoices, a warehouse order report,.and the unpack list (essential for efficient distribution of cases).\r\n\r\nPlease contact me for assistance in installation at tora.san28@gmail.com.
