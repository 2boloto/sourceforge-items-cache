To do so, you must use the Euphoria programming language, and only Versions 2.4 or 2.5. A full copy of it is provided here.\r\n\r\nWhile FreeDOS will not allow the use of PCI 32 bit drivers, FREEDOM operates in a 32 bit DOS extender, and there is no reason why any sharp programmer could not load Linux Sound and Network drivers into machine memory, and let Euphoria interface with them directly.\r\n\r\nThe FREEDOM system will only operate in a FreeDOS environment.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "freedomgui", "_id": "4ef727891be1ce4ee5000a21", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 654861, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "An advanced GUI system for FreeDOS", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: User Interfaces", "shortname": "softwaredev_ui", "fullname": "User Interfaces", "id": 561}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Euphoria", "shortname": "euphoria", "fullname": "Euphoria", "id": 263}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "id": 16}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a user interface (UI) system", "shortname": "ui_meta_system", "fullname": "Project is a user interface (UI) system", "id": 463}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Other", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other", "id": 212}]}}
