They let you categorize your items in multiple ways.\r\n\r\nThe files on your computer can be categorized in only one way, because you store them in a folder and that's it. It would be great if there was an easy way to store the same file in multiple folders at the same time, wouldn't it? Well, Tags allows you to do exactly that on the mac.\r\n\r\nCreate new Tags by duplicating and renaming the Mother Tag. Drag your file or folder on top of a Tag icon to add it to that Tag. Double-click a Tag to view all items that you added to it. Remove items from a Tag by dragging them to the Trash. Or remove the Tag itself by dragging it to the Trash. Tags are just like folders in many ways; you can even tag Tags!\r\n\r\nThe software works on Mac OS X 10.4 and all higher versions.
