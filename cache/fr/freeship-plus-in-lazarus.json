FREE!ship Plus allows the designer to simulate and analyze condition of balance of a complex completely hull - rudders - keels - engine - propellers in different regimes and of service conditions of a ship. The analyzable system includes a hull, appendages, a propeller and the engine (i.e. resistance, power, a thrust and a torque), and also various service conditions (heaving, a wind, a shallow-water effect, a regime of tow / pushi", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "freeship-plus-in-lazarus", "_id": "55036a687929e54b3b246ac9", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2425817, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "design and calculations of hydrodynamics of vessels", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
