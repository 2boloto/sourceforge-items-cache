I decided I'd rather lean towards application development than web development. I have packed up the idea of an integrated productivity environment and moved to VIMAT here on sf.net. Thank you.\r\n\r\nWhat I am aiming for with freeIPE is a colossal set of minimalistic productivity tools that all share the same data. This means a task list, calendar, time tracker, and any other tool that the user feels could be of value.\r\n\r\nMy goal for freeIPE is to have something for all to use, at work or at home (children and grandparents, too). I'd like to have customized sharing of data with other users with the ability to sync data over LAN/Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in this project, I am open to discussion in threads here.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "freeipe", "_id": "50d007571be1ce7fb3df8287", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1188010, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "free integrated productivity environment", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business", "shortname": "office", "fullname": "Office/Business", "id": 129}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: Flat-file", "shortname": "db_file_flat", "fullname": "Flat-file", "id": 521}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
