This means a task list, calendar, time tracker, and any other tool that the user feels could be of value.\r\n\r\nMy goal for freeIPE is to have something for all to use, at work or at home (children and grandparents, too). I'd like to have customized sharing of data with other users with the ability to sync data over LAN/Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in this project, I am open to discussion in threads here.", "shortname": "freeipe", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "free integrated productivity environment", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1188010}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/freeipe/", "video_url": ""}
