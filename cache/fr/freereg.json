The name FreeReg comes from beeing free and the focus on Registrations capabilities. \r\n\r\nThe main idea in the design of the system is that as much as possible should be driven by metadata (normally stored in the database), and changable at runtime through some sort of gui.\r\n\r\nFreeReg is a compilation of the standard functionallity that is needed to build any system. It has functionallity to handle users, persmissions, units, text (and translations of these), guitemplates and a lot more.\r\n\r\nFreeReg is currently beeing rebuilt around a REST architecture. A pure Javascript/html client is used as the client (you can ofcourse ad any other client). The serverside is built using Java, and is also currently beeing rebuilt to use a layered architecture, all metadata and data is stored in a database (MariaDb is the default).
