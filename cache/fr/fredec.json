The algorithm analyses all suspicious frequencies, including the ones that look like an alias at a glance, but may become preferable later. After selection of the initial frequency candidates, the algorithm passes through all their possible combinations and estimates their multi-frequency statistical significance. In the end, it prints out the set of largest frequency tuples that were still found significant.\r\n\r\nThe GPU computing is implemented through CUDA and brings a significant performance increase. It is still possible to run FreDec solely on CPU, if no suitable GPU device is available in the system.\r\n\r\nSee the details of the underlying theory in\r\nBaluev 2013, MNRAS, V. 436, P. 807\r\nThe description of the algorithm itself can be found in arXiv:1309.0100.\r\n\r\nPlease go to the project forum to report any bugs.", "shortname": "fredec", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Parallelized FREquency DEComposer algorithm", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1921777}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fredec/", "video_url": ""}
