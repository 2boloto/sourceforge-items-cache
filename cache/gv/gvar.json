Version 1.1 was released in July 2011 and is available to download, free of charge, from this website.\r\n\r\nDerived from Dr. L.Vanessa Smith's project Exploring International Economic Linkages Using a Global Model, the GVAR Toolbox 1.1 is the second release of a collection of MatLab procedures with an Excel-based interface, designed for the purpose of GVAR modelling. The GVAR modelling approach provides a general yet practical global modelling framework for the quantitative analysis of the relative importance of different shocks and channels of transmission mechanisms. This makes it a suitable tool for policy analysis, although it has been used in a number of other contexts, including analysing credit risk and evaluating the UK entry into the Euro. The GVAR Toolbox 1.1 is primarily tailored to policy analysis and forecasting.", "shortname": "gvar", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "The GVAR Toolbox 1.1 is designed for the purpose of GVAR modelling.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 799258}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gvar/", "video_url": ""}
