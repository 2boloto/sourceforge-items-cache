Version 1.1 was released in July 2011 and is available to download, free of charge, from this website.\r\n\r\nDerived from Dr. L.Vanessa Smith's project Exploring International Economic Linkages Using a Global Model, the GVAR Toolbox 1.1 is the second release of a collection of MatLab procedures with an Excel-based interface, designed for the purpose of GVAR modelling. The GVAR modelling approach provides a general yet practical global modelling framework for the quantitative analysis of the relative importance of different shocks and channels of transmission mechanisms. This makes it a suitable tool for policy analysis, although it has been used in a number of other contexts, including analysing credit risk and evaluating the UK entry into the Euro. The GVAR Toolbox 1.1 is primarily tailored to policy analysis and forecasting.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gvar", "_id": "4fe062d91be1ce211700029e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 799258, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "The GVAR Toolbox 1.1 is designed for the purpose of GVAR modelling.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a user interface (UI) system", "shortname": "ui_meta_system", "fullname": "Project is a user interface (UI) system", "id": 463}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}]}}
