I did a tiny bit of research to figure out how to write it, and that's as far as I got.\r\n\r\nYou would probably want to add it to your startup folder to have it start with Windows.", "shortname": "gvoicesearch", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Converts your CapsLock key to a Google Voice Search button.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 749924}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gvoicesearch/", "video_url": ""}
