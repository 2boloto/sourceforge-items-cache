The USAGE document describes how to use the program, in \r\nless than five minutes you surely will be to enjoy all Seeti's features.\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, 'seeti' means 'my clock' in Arabic.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get in touch, don't hesitate to send an e-mail to \r\ngabriel@phasedesign.com.br.
