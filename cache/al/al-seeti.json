It's potentially useful for people who work by themselves, and/or for \r\nthose who are working on personal projects.\r\n\r\nIt's intended to be pretty simple and straightforward, designed to be used at \r\nhome by its creator. The USAGE document describes how to use the program, in \r\nless than five minutes you surely will be to enjoy all Seeti's features.\r\n\r\nJust out of curiosity, 'seeti' means 'my clock' in Arabic.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get in touch, don't hesitate to send an e-mail to \r\ngabriel@phasedesign.com.br.
