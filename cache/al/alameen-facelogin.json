In face localization, the task is to find the locations and sizes of a known number of faces (usually one). In face detection, one does not have this additional information. Face detection is mostly used along with facial recognition feature to extract faces out of an image or video feed and identify the faces against a set of stored images. This feature can be used for tracking prisoners, attendance and signing in to user accounts. The Viola - Jones Algorithm presents a novel face detection technique, we would implement this technique for face detection and then use eigen faces method to recognize the person in the image. Once recognized the person can easily sign in to any applications without the need of typing passwords or usernames.", "summary": "Login to Websites Automatically Using Your Face as Password", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1935533, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/projectyard", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "alameen-facelogin", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/projectyard/", "username": "projectyard", "name": "Project Yard"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://www.projectyard.blogspot.com", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "id": 471}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Eclipse Public License", "fullname": "Eclipse Public License", "shortname": "eclipselicense", "id": 406}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: JDBC", "fullname": "JDBC", "shortname": "db_api_jdbc", "id": 502}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "id": 252}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}]}}
