The first release of the distribution will contain nearly all of the available OSS software for photography. Future releases will be based on requests and popularity of the applications.\r\n\r\nAs a photographer, I understand that we all have a different workflow when we process our images. I want this distribution to assist with that. being that it is bootable or runs in a VM, there is value in being able to start up an environment which is standard and conducive to your productivity. \r\n\r\nSome people share computers with others or the computer is used for other things besides photography, with this distribution, you can always have that environment no matter where you go.
