It is based on a novel radial visualization capable of simultaneously displaying several thousand alerts, emphasizing the most important alerts or patterns in the dataset. Among other things, AlertWheel offers a new technique for representing bipartite graphs (where links exist between two distinct node groups). Using this approach, links are positioned in a way to reduce occlusion in the visualization. AlertWheel simultaneously combines three link bundling techniques in a novel way to reduce cluttering on the interface. Our solution also incorporates filtering options, annotation, logging and details-on-demand, to support analysis processes as described by specialists in this field.\r\n\r\nThis project was developed as a prototype for a research paper. Not designed for production use. No support will be offered for production installations.\r\n\r\nSee documentation for prerequisites.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "alertwheel", "_id": "5437ce1a1be1ce224c3fb433", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2341020, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "AlertWheel is a visualization-based analysis tool for Snort IDS logs", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security", "shortname": "security", "fullname": "Security", "id": 43}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization", "shortname": "visualization", "fullname": "Visualization", "id": 135}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Microsoft SQL Server", "shortname": "db_net_mssql", "fullname": "Microsoft SQL Server", "id": 530}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: .NET/Mono", "shortname": "ui_dotnet", "fullname": ".NET/Mono", "id": 469}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Security", "shortname": "secindustry", "fullname": "Security", "id": 867}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "id": 906}]}}
