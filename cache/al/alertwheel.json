It is based on a novel radial visualization capable of simultaneously displaying several thousand alerts, emphasizing the most important alerts or patterns in the dataset. Among other things, AlertWheel offers a new technique for representing bipartite graphs (where links exist between two distinct node groups). Using this approach, links are positioned in a way to reduce occlusion in the visualization. AlertWheel simultaneously combines three link bundling techniques in a novel way to reduce cluttering on the interface. Our solution also incorporates filtering options, annotation, logging and details-on-demand, to support analysis processes as described by specialists in this field.\r\n\r\nThis project was developed as a prototype for a research paper. Not designed for production use. No support will be offered for production installations.\r\n\r\nSee documentation for prerequisites.", "shortname": "alertwheel", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "mxdumas", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "AlertWheel is a visualization-based analysis tool for Snort IDS logs", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2341020}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alertwheel/", "video_url": null}
