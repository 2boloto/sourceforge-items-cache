It looks neat and feels great, with a smooth and user friendly interface. I have tried to make program intuitive while at the same time very functional.\r\n\r\nTree of its many functions are: \r\nWake computer from sleepmode and auto adjust power settings so that sleepwaking is seamless. \r\n\r\nAuto adjust system volume so that even if you forget to adjust the system volume after setting the alarm you will still be able to hear it go off.\r\n\r\nSet the time by dragging the analog clock pointers.\r\nEven though this is unnecessary it is still very neat and i think many users will appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThere are still features i would like to add, and the design is probably not final.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "alarmplus", "_id": "542be212c431430a46908081", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2334819, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "Alarm clock tool for windows vista and newer", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
