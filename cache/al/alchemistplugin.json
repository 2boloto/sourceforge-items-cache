It is intended to to extract program properties for machine learning based optimization (see MILEPOST GCC); optimize programs at fine-grain level (such as unrolling, tiling, prefetching, etc); tune default optimization heuristic; gradually decompose program and detect performance or other anomalies; generate benchmarks particularly useful to train ML-based compilers. GCC plugin is licenced under GPLv3 licensed, while future LLVM plugins will be licensed under BSD license. Alchemist plugin is in a preliminary stage (based on MILEPOST ML plugin), so collaborations are very welcome! \r\n", "shortname": "alchemistplugin", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "c_tuning", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Alchemist GCC/LLVM plugin for code analysis and tuning", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1892545}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alchemistplugin/", "video_url": ""}
