AltAnalyze is compatible with any RNASeq data (exons and/or junctions), several Affymetrix splicing sensitive array types (Gene 1.0, Exon 1.0, junction) as well as many conventional array-types (e.g., Affymetrix, Illumina, Agilent). This software requires no advanced knowledge of bioinformatics programs or scripting. All you will need are your junction/exon read or microarray files along with some simple descriptions of the conditions that you're analyzing. RNASeq support is introduced in AltAnalyze 2.0.\r\n\r\nAltAnalyze documentation, installers are provided on this website as well as at http://www.altanalyze.org.
