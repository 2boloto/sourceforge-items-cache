It has all the functionalities of a normal shell, but it was especially coded for anyone who wants to write a PSP LUA Program so could be named apparently as another LUA IDE even if it isn't really.  By its being multi-environment and multi-user, it privileges security: there is a very complex Login System with hierarchy levels that could be set by an Admin. The Admin could also perform bans or suspensions on every non-admin user that executes unappropriate code for the AlphaBase Environment.\r\nAB provides also a multi-medial set of commands that allows you to, for example, print a text using a font file previously loaded, to draw a rectangle, a line, to blit images, to associate some screen ares to a certain commands set that could be clicked by a cursor etc...", "shortname": "alphabasepsp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "PSP Debug Bash and Multi-Environment Shell", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1930761}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/", "video_url": ""}
