It has all the functionalities of a normal shell, but it was especially coded for anyone who wants to write a PSP LUA Program so could be named apparently as another LUA IDE even if it isn't really.  By its being multi-environment and multi-user, it privileges security: there is a very complex Login System with hierarchy levels that could be set by an Admin. The Admin could also perform bans or suspensions on every non-admin user that executes unappropriate code for the AlphaBase Environment.\r\nAB provides also a multi-medial set of commands that allows you to, for example, print a text using a font file previously loaded, to draw a rectangle, a line, to blit images, to associate some screen ares to a certain commands set that could be clicked by a cursor etc...", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "alphabasepsp", "_id": "520a7d31f1fd8d1060521a23", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1930761, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "PSP Debug Bash and Multi-Environment Shell", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "id": 12}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Text Editors :: Integrated Development Environments (IDE)", "shortname": "ide", "fullname": "Integrated Development Environments (IDE)", "id": 65}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Terminals :: Terminal Emulators/X Terminals", "shortname": "virtual", "fullname": "Terminal Emulators/X Terminals", "id": 158}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Debuggers", "shortname": "debuggers", "fullname": "Debuggers", "id": 47}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other License", "id": 196}, {"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Handheld/Mobile/PDA", "shortname": "handhelds", "fullname": "Handheld/Mobile/PDA", "id": 314}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Console-based Platforms :: Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP)", "shortname": "sonypsp", "fullname": "Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP)", "id": 722}]}}
