The Admin could also perform bans or suspensions on every non-admin user that executes unappropriate code for the AlphaBase Environment.\r\nAB provides also a multi-medial set of commands that allows you to, for example, print a text using a font file previously loaded, to draw a rectangle, a line, to blit images, to associate some screen ares to a certain commands set that could be clicked by a cursor etc...", "summary": "PSP Debug Bash and Multi-Environment Shell", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1930761, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "alphabasepsp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/dekran/", "username": "dekran", "name": "Marco Chiarelli"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090819232535.png", "caption": "OSK Input", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090819232535.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090819232714.png", "caption": "Danzeff INPUT", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090819232714.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090826164758.png", "caption": "PSP Drawing", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090826164758.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090828144223.png", "caption": "PSP Drawing 2", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090828144223.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090920212731.png", "caption": "Helper", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20090920212731.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20091009153743.png", "caption": "Environments Feature", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/alphabasepsp/screenshot/20091009153743.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "id": 12}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Handheld/Mobile/PDA", "fullname": "Handheld/Mobile/PDA", "shortname": "handhelds", "id": 314}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "fullname": "Other License", "shortname": "other", "id": 196}, {"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Text Editors :: Integrated Development Environments (IDE)", "fullname": "Integrated Development Environments (IDE)", "shortname": "ide", "id": 65}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Terminals :: Terminal Emulators/X Terminals", "fullname": "Terminal Emulators/X Terminals", "shortname": "virtual", "id": 158}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Debuggers", "fullname": "Debuggers", "shortname": "debuggers", "id": 47}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Console-based Platforms :: Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP)", "fullname": "Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP)", "shortname": "sonypsp", "id": 722}]}}
