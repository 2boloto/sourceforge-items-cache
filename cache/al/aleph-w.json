Dynamic linear hash tables are implemented too.\r\n\r\nThe main algorithms on graphs are implemented in an easy way and with good performance features. Network Flow (maximum and min cost), cut points, topological sort, spanning trees, min paths. etc. The graphs are generic in the sense that they can contain data independent of the algorithm.\r\n\r\nSeveral containers of the C++ STL library are implemented with Aleph-w.
