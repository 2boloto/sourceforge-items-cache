This project uses modern technologies (Android tablet/smartphone and Google App Engine) to monitor seniors\u2019 daily life. It\u2019s like having a personal assistant with them 24/7.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this project is to deliver a system which consists of a cloud based server application and a client application running on mobile devices. Carer can create \r\nevents for seniors on the server application via a web interface (Google App Engine). And the client application on senior\u2019s mobile device reads events from the server then remind them for the events. Also, the client application can record senior\u2019s response to the event and report back to the server for carers to review. \r\n\r\nNote: Due to the project contract with my client, I cannot release the source code for this project.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aleo", "_id": "4ff409d60594ca3d9500014a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 812350, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
