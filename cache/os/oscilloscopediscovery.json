It was started as a homework for one of my labs. After I have finished the lab I wanted to do some fixes and upgrade in both the hardware and software world. I wanted to share with you my project because I found useful some other open source project myself and maybe it will be useful for you. (at least you will see some antipatterns which you want to avoid :) )\r\nThe oscilloscope is based on the popular stm32f4discovery kit which is extended with my PCB (analog frontend, power supply and LCD interface) and an LCD module.
