The open source Java tool allows users to calculate readability for Arabic text (with and without diacritics). The tool provides methods to split the text into words and sentence, count syllables, Faseeh letters, hard and complex words in addition to adding diacritics (vocalise text). This makes the tool useful for researchers and educators working with Arabic text. All the readability metrics mentioned in Section \\ref{calcRead} are included within the open source code, they all work with vocalised and non-vocalised text but based our results presented here we recommend adding the diacritics in by using the addTashkeel() method. See the files sections for the vocalised version of UN Arabic English parallel paragraphs.
