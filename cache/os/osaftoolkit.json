The OSAF-Toolkit was developed, as a senior design project, by a group of  IT students from the University of Cincinnati, wanting to pioneer and pave the way for standardization of Android malware analysis. The OSAF-Toolkit is built from Ubuntu 11.10 and pre-compiled with all of the tools needed to rip apart applications for code review and malware analysis. Our primary goal with the toolkit is to be able to make application analysis as easy as possible. We also wanted to create a community where security professionals, analysts, developers and newcommers can learn, discuss and share methodologies with one another. \r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter @OSAF_Community\r\nFollow us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/OpenSourceAndroidForensics ", "shortname": "osaftoolkit", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "OSAF-TK your one stop shop for Android malware analysis and forensics.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "OSAF", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 703837}, {"label": "OSAF Community Site", "mount_point": "link", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/osaftoolkit/", "video_url": ""}
