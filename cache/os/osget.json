The cross platform template is based on the open source mobile gaming framework EMO which uses scripting language Squirrel to support Android and iOS. The template includes common gaming features such as introductory splash page, changing between level scenes, integrated player control, physical behaviours such as velocity against gravitational force, object collision detection and handling, carrying over the current state of the game including the score over to the level scene, background scrolling, playing different audio channels, event triggering at timeout intervals, level one mission to gain points by dealing with multiple objects, final level mission to deal with the enemy boss, score submission through HTTP. OSGET is designed to make coding reusable as it is based on MVC where the controller uses OOP inheritance. OSGET makes interactive action game development more cost effective as it can be run on multiple platforms.", "shortname": "osget", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "OSGET is the first open source mobile game engine template.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 751455}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/osget/", "video_url": ""}
