It makes mantis aware of exactly which versions of which files fix which bugs. This turns out to be extremely valuable information. Bugs that are fixed can then be included in releases, and since it is known what files fix the bug a release package to update the file set can be automatically created. Not only that, a corresponding package of files enabling instant rolllback to a previous version should something go wrong is created. Deploys to test, staging, and production servers can be automated. WebSVN is used to enable selection of files from an SVN repository, and also provides a quick way to diff files which have changed in a given version.", "summary": "Bugs and Versions - Bug Tracking, Version Control, Release Management", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 682114, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bugsandversions", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/pjjt/", "username": "pjjt", "name": "Peter Tracey"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "id": 8}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "id": 680}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "fullname": "MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "id": 524}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "fullname": "Software Development", "shortname": "development", "id": 45}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools", "fullname": "Build Tools", "shortname": "build", "id": 46}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Agile development tools", "fullname": "Agile development tools", "shortname": "agile", "id": 764}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "id": 537}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
