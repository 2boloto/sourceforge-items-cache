BudgetedSVM trains models with accuracy comparable to LibSVM in time comparable to LibLinear, as it allows solving highly non-linear classi\ffication problems with millions of high-dimensional examples within minutes on a regular personal computer. We provide command-line and Matlab interfaces to BudgetedSVM, effi\u000ecient API for handling large-scale, high-dimensional data sets, as well as detailed documentation to help developers use and further extend the toolbox.", "summary": "BudgetedSVM: A C++ Toolbox for Large-scale, Non-linear Classification", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1739965, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "budgetedsvm", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/djurikom/", "username": "djurikom", "name": "Nemanja Djuric"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://www.dabi.temple.edu/budgetedsvm/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "fullname": "BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 187}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Algorithms", "fullname": "Algorithms", "shortname": "algorithms", "id": 620}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "id": 133}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence :: Machine Learning", "fullname": "Machine Learning", "shortname": "machinelearning", "id": 802}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": []}}
