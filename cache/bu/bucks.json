A new multiplayer game! For an ancient OS that these days never sees more than one person logged in at a time. Written In C. Deliberately using non-portable code. Sockets are for losers. VMS Mailboxes is where it's at.   \r\n\r\nThe current source code repository is SVN here on sourceforge. Because of the limited options for OpenVMS, I'm currently using jsvn (java) which works fine but requires some manual setup. See the readme for details. Note that it is only jsvn which requires Java, not the game itself. So although Java isn't available for the VAX architecture, if you ftp the sourcecode to a VAX box, it'll compile and run just fine. Well, it'll be <em>really</em> slow but it'll run.\r\n\r\nSee the SVN repo for code. Work in progress.\r\n\r\nsee readme for checkout instructions on OpenVMS: https://sourceforge.net/p/bucks/code-0/HEAD/tree/trunk/readme.md\r\n\r\nSee the wiki for progress and remaining tasks.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bucks", "_id": "5300ee58ea406b57ba80074b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2103303, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}], "summary": "multiplayer stockmarket game for OpenVMS", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Simulation", "shortname": "simulation", "fullname": "Simulation", "id": 85}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: OpenVMS", "shortname": "openvms", "fullname": "OpenVMS", "id": 446}]}}
