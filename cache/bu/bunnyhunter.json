The view is scrolling\r\nhorizontally to the right when the player character moves forward. The background\r\nshows distant canyons and clouds in the sky. The bottom of the level is filled with\r\nwater and will instantly kill the player character if both get into contact with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe player character will move on and jump over to random rocks, sticking\r\nout of the water. The width and height will be different to make the game more\r\nchallenging. The player is only in control of a jump button, which will keep\r\nthe automatically forward-moving player character from falling down into\r\nthe deadly water.\r\n\r\nThe level will be randomly populated with collectible items consisting of gold coins\r\nand feather power-ups.", "summary": "A 2D side scrolling cross platform game in Java", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2367543, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bunnyhunter", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/zafermukeri/", "username": "zafermukeri", "name": "Zafer Mukeri"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bunnyhunter/screenshot/Screenshot_5.png", "caption": "BUNNY HUNTER", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bunnyhunter/screenshot/Screenshot_5.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://bunnyhunter.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
