People living in this fast changing world would likely to spend lesser time to complete more jobs. Therefore, people in Mumbai will not want to spend extra times on waiting buses and finding buses. If we have a mobile device that can provide updated bus route information with bus arrival time based on your current location, it will definitely help us to manage our time efficiently and we can better time our plan. The aim of this project is to develop an application on a mobile device running the Google Android platform and it provides relevant bus route information with bus arrival time prediction.\r\n", "summary": "", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1953305, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "buslocationandarrivaltime", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/projectyard/", "username": "projectyard", "name": "Project Yard"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
