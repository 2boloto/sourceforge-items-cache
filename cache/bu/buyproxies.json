We can assume that the fact that the proxy owner has setup proxy server and made it technically possible for everybody without restricting access to that service, it indicates that that is what he wanted in the first place. Because open http proxy servers allows connections and use of the service by anyone in the world, the proxy's administrator has essentially \"authorized\" everyone to use the service. The reasons behind it may be very different, and in many cases there are no long-term plans behind a public proxy. \r\n\r\nThe situation is very similar with any websites!
