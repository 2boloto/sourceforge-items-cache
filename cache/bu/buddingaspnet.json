If I'm doing something wrong, or someone sees a better way of doing it, by all means, throw it out there.\r\n\r\nNothing mind-boggling or earth-shattering here.  I will complete the exercises in the book, and maybe add other projects that I find along the way so that I have a consolidated portfolio to show an employer---and if someone else can use any source code created here, go for it.\r\n\r\nIf there are any developers reading this, please; your knowledge and experience is welcomed and greatly appreciated!
