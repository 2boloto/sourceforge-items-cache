It could also conceivably be used in training of medical staff in preparation for malignant tumor treatment with the process known as electrochemotherapy. This well-researched and developed treatment has a high success rate and is being adopted by many medical institutions performing cancer treatment worldwide, creating a need for educational software such as ApiVizTEP to provide a graphic and interactive tool doctors and technicians can use to familiarize themselves with the processes of electrochemotherapeutic treatment. The aspect of electrochemotherapy this application allows you to study in particular, is perhaps the most important one. Using analytical methods, ApiVizTEP calculates the electrostatic field generated by up to 6 groups of needle electrodes inserted in tumor and surrounding tissue...", "summary": "Application for Visualization of Target Tissue in Electroporation", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 802733, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "apiviztep", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/samomahnic/", "username": "samomahnic", "name": "Samo Mahnic"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig5.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig5.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig4.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig4.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig3.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig3.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig2.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig2.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig6.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig6.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig7.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/apiviztep/screenshot/fig7.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "fullname": "C#", "shortname": "csharp", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "id": 97}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization", "fullname": "Visualization", "shortname": "visualization", "id": 135}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education", "fullname": "Education", "shortname": "education", "id": 71}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Healthcare Industry", "fullname": "Healthcare Industry", "shortname": "healthcareindustry", "id": 362}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}]}}
