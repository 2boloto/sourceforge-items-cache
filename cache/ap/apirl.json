It was developed to provide an image reconstruction algorithm for the AR-PET (Argentine Positron Emission Tomography), a low cost PET scanner. The implemented algorithms are based on the well known iterative algorithms MLEM and OSEM. In addition, provides an image reconstruction algorithm for a tomographic gamma scanner for non-destructive assay of nuclear waste drums.\r\nThe library is being developedd in c++ with different classes for the input data and the projectors used in MLEM and OSEM. It allows to introduce new input data and projector classes easily thanks to the use of polymorphism and inheritance. At the moment the input data format is interfile for images and sinograms, and the configuration files for the command line tools are similar to interfile.\r\nThe community is invited to introduce new features and improvements in the library.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "apirl", "_id": "529e503bf1fd8d044b024622", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2031158, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "kcl", "name": "svn", "label": "KCL_CODES"}], "summary": "Library and command line tools for Tomographic Image Reconstruction", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
