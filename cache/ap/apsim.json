The particles in the game interact, creating reactions and new particles (of course it is very CPU consuming).\r\n\r\nThe user is placed into a virtual environment, and has many tools at his/her disposal. Particles can be placed, removed, pushed, evaporated, dragged, attracted, etc. In fact, many different possibilities can take place.\r\n\r\nNow, what's the use? The usefulness of this tool is for you to decide; it may be of some entertaining value to some people, while it may be of some serious value to another. We simply put the simulator out for you; you decide what you want to do with it.\r\n\r\nFrom http://apsim.dyndns.org/productiveproductions/apsim.php", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "apsim", "_id": "503279cdb9363c63999d1567", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 864750, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "link", "name": "link", "label": "APSim External Site"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "APSim is a small powder/particle simulator game in Java.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
