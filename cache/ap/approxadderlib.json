To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source library of approximate adders that facilitates reproducible comparisons and further research and development in this direction across various layers of design abstraction.\r\n\r\nThis work is a result of collaborative effort between Chair for Embedded Systems (CES) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany and Vision Image and Signal Processing (VISpro) Lab at SEECS-NUST, Pakistan.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "approxadderlib", "_id": "5567529eb9363c47583b44b6", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2470382, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Library of Approximate Adders", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Hardware", "shortname": "hardware", "fullname": "Hardware", "id": 146}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Electronic Design Automation (EDA)", "shortname": "eda", "fullname": "Electronic Design Automation (EDA)", "id": 246}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing :: Performance Testing", "shortname": "perftest", "fullname": "Performance Testing", "id": 810}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: VHDL/Verilog", "shortname": "vhdl_verilog", "fullname": "VHDL/Verilog", "id": 551}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
