For example, a unique name of the project, dependence on other projects and libraries, methods of construction, etc. Thus, the entire repository should be marked by the project description files to provide unambiguous information on the projects and their dependencies.\r\n- AppM Build Automaiton must be able to perform different actions (project construction, external applications launch, file copying, etc.) which are needed to build a -product.\r\n- All operations with projects should be carried out on the basis of information that build tool derives from the project description files.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "appm-build-automation", "_id": "54252c523e5e8338658b34a5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2331469, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Automated software application for constructing and building projects.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools", "shortname": "build", "fullname": "Build Tools", "id": 46}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Code Generators", "shortname": "codegen", "fullname": "Code Generators", "id": 259}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Compilers", "shortname": "compilers", "fullname": "Compilers", "id": 48}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Delphi/Kylix", "shortname": "Delphi", "fullname": "Delphi/Kylix", "id": 265}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": []}}
