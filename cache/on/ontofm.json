Besides serving as an information retrieval aid, OntoFM allows the user to specify and update the semantic links between information items, constituting thus a complete personal information management tool.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of OntoFM is based on Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, an extensible open source ontology editor and knowledge-base framework. The file manager is implemented as a Protege tab widget, retrieving information from your personal ontology. Ontology visualization is based upon the OntoGraf plug-in which has been extended to comply with the mind map paradigm.\r\n\r\nOntoFM is under continuous development and improvement. \r\n\r\nPerform semantic search for the desktop by exploiting user ontology relations to present files associated with specific concepts! Use the OntoFM file manager to explore your personal information space!", "shortname": "ontofm", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Download OntoFM at http://hci-vr.cst.uop.gr/ontofm/download", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 951451}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ontofm/", "video_url": ""}
