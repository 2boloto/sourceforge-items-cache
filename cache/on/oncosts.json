These meta-data of the sequencing and analysis procedures include information about the samples and projects as well as the sequencing centers, platforms, data locations, results locations, alignments, analysis specifications and further information relevant to the experiments.\r\nThe sample tracking system for oncogenomic studies (Onco-STS) is designed to store these data and make them easily accessible to the researchers who work with the samples. The system is a web application, which includes a database and a front-end web page that allows the remote access, submission and updating of the sample data in the database.
