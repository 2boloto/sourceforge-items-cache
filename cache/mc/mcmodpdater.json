Yes, you just found this awesome mod that you know everybody will love, but. most of your users will have no idea how to install it.  \"Just update the forum post, then everybody will understand!\"  Well, no that's not how it works, most of us don't even read the forum post after joining (well, me, anyway).  \"Then just change the MOTD!\"  And cause more problems for your users?  \r\n\r\nFor a solution, you don't need to look further than Minecraft's own launcher for a concept!  If you look at Minecraft's launcher, you notice just how simple it is to update.
