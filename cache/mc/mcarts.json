This algorithm learns and quantifies rules of these features, taking advantage of a large number of in vivo RBP binding sites obtained from high throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP). We applied this algorithm to study two representative RBPs, Nova and Mbnl.
