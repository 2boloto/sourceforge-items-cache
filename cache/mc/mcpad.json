McPad is not for you. McPad aims to be a lightweight software. By itself, it does nothing differently than Notch's distributed server software. However, you can choose which features to add by browsing for plugins, or even writing your own. McPad exposes a powerful API to developers that allow them to hook into the server without having to delve into networking. It allows server hosts to choose what features they want, rather than only use a few of the features that would be offered if we had packed everything in there. Not only is that inefficient, but it is hard to work with as well.
