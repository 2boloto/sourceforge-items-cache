It is well suited for remote administration and to be used as part of automated server maintenance scripts.

It compiles on all proper compilers and environments which supports POSIX and C99 (basically almost all C compiler environments).\r\n\r\n*Note that this app is still in beta stage so there might be quirks and incomplete implementations of features here and there. No major problems know at the moment.*\r\n\r\nProject github: https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon", "shortname": "mcrcon", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Console based rcon client for minecraft servers.", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 752524}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mcrcon/", "video_url": ""}
