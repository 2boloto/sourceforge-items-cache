Each player plays on their own course.  Multiple games with multiple courses can be created.\r\n\r\nCreate multi-player courses and compete head-to-head to blow-up your targets first.  Use any block as a target. When the block is hit it explodes. \r\n\r\nThis is the first beta. I believe most functionality is working properly, but I've only tested it on my machine. Any feedback is appreciated. \r\n\r\nKnown issues: Directional blocks may not stay facing the direction they were placed after the game is reset. \r\n\r\nFuture functionality: Disappearing target blocks.", "shortname": "mcbullseye", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Bow and Arrow BullsEye game plugin for Minecraft Bukkit servers", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2091112}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mcbullseye/", "video_url": null}
