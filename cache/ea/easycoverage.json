When writing unit tests, developers often have to write the same elementary verifications over and over for most classes. This is tedious and error-prone, and keeps developers away from writing more meaningful unit tests. Easy Coverage is extensible and highly configurable. It can work as a standalone product, or be used with JUnit, which is highly recommended. Support for TestNG is planned.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get started, you should go to the wiki and the quick start.", "shortname": "easycoverage", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Dynamically generated unit tests for basic verifications.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Source", "mount_point": "source", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 769976}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/easycoverage/", "video_url": ""}
