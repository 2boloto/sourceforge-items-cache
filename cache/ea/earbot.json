This toolbox is a collection of classes that encapsulate Simulink blocks and multichannel audio models and systems. The aim is to provide a platform from which to evaluate the performance of audio processing algorithms.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a user interface for building and controlling Simulink models. These models are built from blocks whose implementation resides in classes in the sim-tools\\blocks directory. \r\n\r\nTo provide a performance increase on multicore systems, it is possible to automatically split the model up into three separate instances of MATLAB, each separately running a Simulink model.", "shortname": "earbot", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Sound localisation in real-time using Simulink", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1554011}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/earbot/", "video_url": ""}
