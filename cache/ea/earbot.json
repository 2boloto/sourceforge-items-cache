This toolbox is a collection of classes that encapsulate Simulink blocks and multichannel audio models and systems. The aim is to provide a platform from which to evaluate the performance of audio processing algorithms.\r\n\r\nAlso included is a user interface for building and controlling Simulink models. These models are built from blocks whose implementation resides in classes in the sim-tools\\blocks directory. \r\n\r\nTo provide a performance increase on multicore systems, it is possible to automatically split the model up into three separate instances of MATLAB, each separately running a Simulink model.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "earbot", "_id": "5169e43e24b0d91fc9f2c2cf", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1554011, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Sound localisation in real-time using Simulink", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "shortname": "communications", "fullname": "Communications", "id": 20}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
