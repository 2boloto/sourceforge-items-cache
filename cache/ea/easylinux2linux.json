Why not use them to get your new linux running directly?\r\n\r\nMany distributions already provide a network install but getting the installer to run on your old linux proves tricky because you depend on local libraries and tools.\r\n\r\nWhy not rely instead only on the linux kernel? You unpack a minimal set of tools to a separate directory, you chroot to it and start from a well defined configuration that can get you to your destination. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "easylinux2linux", "_id": "4f9055bd1be1ce435e000406", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 752433, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "scripts and minimal binary packs to migrate from one distro to another", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
