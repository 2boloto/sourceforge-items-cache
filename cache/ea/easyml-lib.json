Each per-language implementation contains the needed serialization components for the DTD basic types. In addition, each implementation can also extend the DTD with language-specific types. Non-DTD types could be even sent between different languages if they are defined for both sides.\r\n\r\nExample: In the Java implementation, EasyML by default only supports the DTD types, but can be manually or automatically (ExtendedEasyML class) configured for full Java support.\r\n\r\nAnnouncement: the Java implementation has matured for a while now so the main focus will shift to developing implementations in other languages, like C#, Python, or GoLang. Anyone interested to help can contact me by this site or by e-mail (see javadoc @author).\r\n", "shortname": "easyml-lib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "EasyML format and various implementations.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 624112}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/easyml-lib/", "video_url": null}
