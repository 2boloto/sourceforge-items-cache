Each per-language implementation contains the needed serialization components for the DTD basic types. In addition, each implementation can also extend the DTD with language-specific types. Non-DTD types could be even sent between different languages if they are defined for both sides.\r\n\r\nExample: In the Java implementation, EasyML by default only supports the DTD types, but can be manually or automatically (ExtendedEasyML class) configured for full Java support.\r\n\r\nAnnouncement: the Java implementation has matured for a while now so the main focus will shift to developing implementations in other languages, like C#, Python, or GoLang. Anyone interested to help can contact me by this site or by e-mail (see javadoc @author).\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "easyml-lib", "_id": "50977fda34309d393503455a", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 624112, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "EasyML format and various implementations.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Formats and Protocols :: Data Formats :: XML", "shortname": "xml", "fullname": "XML", "id": 559}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "id": 606}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
