The advantage over Uml and Dsl is that the combined power of\r\n\r\nJava reflection (to parse the model classes)\r\nInterfaces (to provide the generator with whatever information)\r\nAnnotation's (for all kinds of fine-grained information)\r\nplus the incredible Jet engine\r\nmake it so flexible and powerful.\r\n\r\nPlease download the easymda-reactive.zip file, follow the steps in the user's guide and generate a fully functional Reactive application.\r\n\r\n>> See the Wiki pages for more How-to instructions. <<", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "easymda", "_id": "53e86a903e5e83396e46ce3e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2302949, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "An Eclipse plugin that generates source-code, from a Java based model", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Code Generators", "shortname": "codegen", "fullname": "Code Generators", "id": 259}], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
