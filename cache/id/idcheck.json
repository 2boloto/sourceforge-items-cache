The server uses a private cookie scoped only for the client browser and the idcheck webserver which is always protected with SSL.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the common practise of using SSL for everything (which idcheck supports). The idcheck system can also be used to provide authentication to websites where you merely want to hide content from various people. For example, an intranet whose contents are available to thousands of people. This is, in fact, its main advantage and feature.\r\n\r\nPlease check the wiki pages for more info (link above).\r\n\r\nPlease submit patches or problems via the patches section (link above).\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are many idcheck RPMs on various web pages.
