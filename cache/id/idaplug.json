IDA provides an extensive API for C language plugin development. While efficient, C can be painful and time consuming as soon as you attempt to develop high level tasks.\r\n\r\nThis project attempts to provide :\r\n- A framework that let you develop plugins using C#\r\n- Visual Studio integration for ease of use\r\n\r\nPlugins are mixed mode libraries (managed+unmanaged) relying on a .Net library wrapping the native API.\r\n\r\nUsing a wrapping layer, performances are expected to be poorer than those from the native API. Consequently this project shouldn't be considered a catch all replacement for the existing native API.\r\n\r\nThe project is in early development stage.
