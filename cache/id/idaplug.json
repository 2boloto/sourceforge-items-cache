IDA provides an extensive API for C language plugin development. While efficient, C can be painful and time consuming as soon as you attempt to develop high level tasks.\r\n\r\nThis project attempts to provide :\r\n- A framework that let you develop plugins using C#\r\n- Visual Studio integration for ease of use\r\n\r\nPlugins are mixed mode libraries (managed+unmanaged) relying on a .Net library wrapping the native API.\r\n\r\nUsing a wrapping layer, performances are expected to be poorer than those from the native API. Consequently this project shouldn't be considered a catch all replacement for the existing native API.\r\n\r\nThe project is in early development stage. See project wiki for milestones and completion points.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer : This project is neither backed nor supported by Hex-Rays SA.", "shortname": "idaplug", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Visual Studio integrated framework for C# plugins targeting IDA Pro", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1925674}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/idaplug/", "video_url": ""}
