The answers are based on what is written in the texts explicitly. This means the system works according to a purely extractive Question Answering paradigm, in which no reasoning or deduction is used.\r\nCurrently IdSay uses only the Portuguese language, but we intend to introduce other languages, for instance English, and to explore multilingual issues.\r\n", "shortname": "idsay", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "IdSay is an Open Domain Question Answering System", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 857057}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/idsay/", "video_url": ""}
