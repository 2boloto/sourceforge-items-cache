This software was used internally by employees and by their clients. This project was used until the end of 2009. The initial project was called \"LA SCHEM@TECH\" and was used to search pdf documents : electrical diagram , synoptic. I began to refound it completely and add new features in a proroject called \"IDEALTAKE\" in october 2007. The first usable version come in July 2012.\r\nInstallation files are made for windows XP(1.4), seven and windows 8 (1.5).\r\nTwo databases are hosted on my server, allowing you to make a demonstration (8h00-23h00 Paris Time) ", "shortname": "idealtake", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/IdealTake/191066044335951?sk=info", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Search engine using MySql and VB .NET", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 829400}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/idealtake/", "video_url": ""}
