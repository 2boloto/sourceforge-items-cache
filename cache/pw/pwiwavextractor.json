There are ways of opening these PWI files in modern versions of MS Office, but extracting the WAV files isn't so simple. PwiWavExtractor comes to the rescue. It will extract all WAVs from a given PWI.\r\n\r\nPwiWavExtractor is a user-friendly Windows application that requires no special installation. You just run the program, browse for your PWI file, and then click the Extract button. The newly created WAV files will automatically be saved in the same folder as the PWI.\r\n\r\nActually, PwiWavExtractor should be able to extract WAVs from any type of binary file, not just PWIs.\r\n\r\nThis is a .NET WinForms application written in C#. I want the code for this software to be as useful to you as possible, so I'm releasing it into the public domain. Use the code freely in any type of project you want. Go nuts.
