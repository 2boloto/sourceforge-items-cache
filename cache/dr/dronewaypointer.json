It has so far only been tested on the tum_simulator and not on the actual drone. The main functionalities it provides is camera streams of front or bottom cameras of the drone, button and slider control of the drone XYZ velocities, control using waypoints and waypoint commands, pose estimation using simple dead-reckoning and measurement and image recording functionalities.", "shortname": "dronewaypointer", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A ROS package to remotely control the Parrot AR Drone 2.0", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2380771}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dronewaypointer/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/gOu98SSHVn4?rel=0"}
