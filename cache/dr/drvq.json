As a by-product of training, a tree structure performs either exact or approximate quantization on trained centroids, the latter being not very precise but extremely fast.\r\n\r\nA detailed README file describes the usage of the software, including license, requirements, installation, file formats, sample data, tools, and options. With the sample data provided and the default options, it is possible to test the code immediately as a demo.\r\n\r\nDRVQ has a 2-clause BSD license.
