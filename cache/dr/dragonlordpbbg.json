No monitors existed, it was printer for display. Kill the mob, advance, better weapon, kill the next, untill you slayed 10 of them and ended with the ultimate weapon. Several years later when I started running a BBS I fell in love with L.O.R.D. It was very similar to mine with a better lay out. Dragon Lord is my attempt to recreate both my original, with the L.O.R.D style - it is written completely from scratch, and streamlined for faster game play.  This project is not advertised, however it is available for those who want to tinker with it.
