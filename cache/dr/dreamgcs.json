Because you work in one environment there is no need for external tools, unless you need more advanced features. DREAM will start out with only the most basic of features, and will not require the latest in hardware and graphics technology. Think the graphics of Unreal Tournament - Unreal Tournament 2004, without the restrictions, and the simplicity of UnrealED. The engine running DREAM is as yet untitled, and the package will include one game, a sort of interactive dream translator and world builder for the player's dreams using their own unique dream symbolism.", "shortname": "dreamgcs", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "DREAM is an Open Source GCS", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 664582}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dreamgcs/", "video_url": ""}
