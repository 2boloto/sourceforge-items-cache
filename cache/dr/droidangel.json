Aim of this project is to recreate Blue Angel 69 using Java based on Blue Angel 07 c++ windows remake. Yeah it is a remake of a remake :) Idea was first to create core game components in Java and later proceed in creating an AI for that game. One was already implemented in Blue Angel 07 and it will be converted from c++ to Java. Lastly, android frontend will be created, with enhanced graphics and sound. Playing with AI and with other players (on the same device or bluetooth) will be supported.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "droidangel", "_id": "51b9a35ec4314370075c2070", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1876174, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "Android remake for legendary logic game Blue Angel 69", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
