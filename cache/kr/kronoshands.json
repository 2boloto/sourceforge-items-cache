That can be done by building a program made to plan tasks with a friendly user interface. In a certain way, that could help a lot of peoples that a troubles using the basics tools for tasks programming.\r\nThe idea is to have an agenda, most likely like google agenda for example. But the main difference would be that not only you can program events and meetings at a certain time, but you can also program the launch of anything wich is on your computer on the same interface.\r\n\r\nThis program is developped in Java Swings for windows 7 and linux", "shortname": "kronoshands", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Kronos hands is a friendly user tasks planning.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 709428}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kronoshands/", "video_url": ""}
