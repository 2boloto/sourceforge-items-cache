At the end of the changes the programmer can build the change pack with one click that they can then submit for code reviews, code merges etc. to other team members. All the programmer needs to do is set the project path that should be monitored by this app for changes, set the destination path where all the changed files should be put to and click \"Start Monitoring\". The monitoring can be stopped at any time and can be resumed from that point as well. The key feature of this tool is that it retains the original folder structure of the project (excluding the project root). For e.g. if the project is structured like C:\\Projects\\OrderManager\\BusinessLayer\\Order.cs, the change pack would have same folder structure from BusinessLayer onward all the way down to the file. This is an obvious advantage in complex projects which have a very deeply nested folder structure.", "summary": "real time code file change tracking & pack building for .NET projects", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2066278, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "changepackbuilder", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/zapmeister/", "username": "zapmeister", "name": "Aman Agrawal"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/changepackbuilder/screenshot/CPB%20Running.png", "caption": "CPB tracking the changed files as I am working on the project", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/changepackbuilder/screenshot/CPB%20Running.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/changepackbuilder/screenshot/build%20pack.png", "caption": "click \"Build Change Pack\" to build the pack", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/changepackbuilder/screenshot/build%20pack.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/changepackbuilder/screenshot/pack%20ready.png", "caption": "Pack is ready.
