As soon as chaOS41 produces value, a fraction is added to cover cost, and then some, and stored in a chaOS41 wallet assigned to the owner of that server.\r\nRisk management is our job, and distributing production geographically and a statement of non disclosure ensures your privacy.\r\nEssentially, your server runs a copy of chaOS41. Unit validation requires first that the keyMaker includes your server, and a unit is ready for trade. However the unit only becomes real after reality binding. This is a simple process of buying land, and allocating the legal document as a UID to the batch that needed creation. Legal goes to legal, and the value with collateral is spent. Rather than having that get in the way of business, Such designated value is moved, it may unbind its key for it is simpler to store no value than the complexity of theft protection.", "shortname": "chaos41serversuite", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "the easy way to turn a server into a chaOS41 base", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1939243}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaos41serversuite/", "video_url": ""}
