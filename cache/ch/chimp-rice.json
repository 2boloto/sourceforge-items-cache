The various features of CHIMP include automatic generation of monitors from temporal assertions, automatic instrumentation of the model-under-verification (MUV), and three-way communication among the MUV, the generated monitors, and the SystemC simulation kernel during the monitored execution of the instrumented MUV. Empirical results show that CHIMP puts minimal runtime overhead on the monitored execution of the MUV.\r\n\r\nA newly added path in CHIMP results in a significant (over 75%) reduction of average monitor generation and compilation time.  The average size of the monitors is reduced by over 60%, without increasing runtime overhead.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chimp-rice", "_id": "4f8cd3e91be1ce7b3400069d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 750184, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Tool for Assertion-based Dynamic Verification of SystemC models", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
