You can chat with other peers in clear text or AES password-based encryption on your own computer network.\r\n\r\nThe AES encryption and decryption is based on 128 bit key which is reached by padding the resulting SHA256 from your provided password. Simply put, SHA is a checksum that change when a single bit change. When you send a message with a password field, the resulting password checksum is cut at 128 bit which means 16 characters bytes KEY is entered into AES 128 bit encryption and decryption scheme. The resulting ciphertext is sent to the server while the server relay it to the connected peers. Those connected peers need to have the same password in order to read the message.\r\n\r\nThe server is a multiplex and stand alone detached (no controlling terminal) process on the background that does nothing but to relay messages.", "summary": "", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2370167, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chatroomsourceaessupport", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/juanjo88/", "username": "juanjo88", "name": "Juan J.
