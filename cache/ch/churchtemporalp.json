The language is designed to allow the construction of probabilistic generative models representing hypotheses.  The language also gives mechanisms for efficiently sampling from those generative models and using those samples to estimate the probability that a given generative model would produce a given set of observed data.  In other words, the language allows use to estimate the probability that a given hypothesis is correct, given a particular set of observed data.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on hypotheses about the temporal relationships between events (that is, on hypotheses like \u201cif event A occurs, then event B will occur 30 seconds later\u201d).  \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "churchtemporalp", "_id": "4fc4bbd61be1ce0ccf000212", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 782022, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
