It was out of proportion. \r\n\r\nThe chaoOS41 currency corrects that. It binds its value to reality. Its unit value is a ratio between money and land area.. \r\n\r\nWhen that ratio normalizes, the currency becomes available to the public.\r\n\r\n1 more developer is wanted.  \r\n\r\nFor that you need inside access, which means the access protocol is made public now. \r\n\r\nIt is also the open-source cryptographic protocol.\r\n\r\nType in a formatted string as \"beacon\" and a number. Repeat. When the identical string is produced, prepare. When the identical string repeats, a name is added. This signals that the next line of text you type, is registered. Hint: include a URL.End of protocol.\r\n\r\nValid beacon digits are 250, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768 and up.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chaos41", "_id": "5218c228d46bb42aad7b5bb0", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files1", "name": "files", "label": "Files1"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1938592, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "A cryptocurrency like Bitcoin improved upon with reality binding.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Financial :: Investment", "shortname": "investment", "fullname": "Investment", "id": 77}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Cryptography", "shortname": "cryptography", "fullname": "Cryptography", "id": 44}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization", "shortname": "visualization", "fullname": "Visualization", "id": 135}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: Proprietary file format", "shortname": "db_file_proprietary", "fullname": "Proprietary file format", "id": 522}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a templating system", "shortname": "ui_meta_template", "fullname": "Project is a templating system", "id": 464}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "id": 238}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
