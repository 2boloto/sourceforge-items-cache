The Charon Housing System makes use of the Charon Application Environment which is covered elsewhere. Charon Housing's two key features are: It is designed to be ultra-scalable, so can handle thousands of concurrent users and that it is a fully multi-authority system. This second feature is required by organizations that manage the housing requirements for client RSLs. There is no other system that I know of that has these features built in from the design stage.\r\n\r\nNext demo was scheduled for January 2014, yet here we are a year later and still no release. This is because of changes in personal circumstances of the team members. The project is still being work on but at a much slower rate.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "charonhousing", "_id": "4f565f011be1ce64d70005d8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 716051, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Open Source Housing System for UK RSLs", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise :: CRM", "shortname": "crm", "fullname": "CRM", "id": 579}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Oracle", "shortname": "db_net_oracle", "fullname": "Oracle", "id": 526}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "shortname": "db_net_pgsql", "fullname": "PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "id": 525}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Microsoft SQL Server", "shortname": "db_net_mssql", "fullname": "Microsoft SQL Server", "id": 530}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Non-Profit Organizations", "shortname": "nonprofit", "fullname": "Non-Profit Organizations", "id": 618}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Government", "shortname": "government", "fullname": "Government", "id": 569}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
