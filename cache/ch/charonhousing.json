The Charon Housing System makes use of the Charon Application Environment which is covered elsewhere. Charon Housing's two key features are: It is designed to be ultra-scalable, so can handle thousands of concurrent users and that it is a fully multi-authority system. This second feature is required by organizations that manage the housing requirements for client RSLs. There is no other system that I know of that has these features built in from the design stage.\r\n\r\nNext demo was scheduled for January 2014, yet here we are a year later and still no release. This is because of changes in personal circumstances of the team members. The project is still being work on but at a much slower rate.\r\n", "shortname": "charonhousing", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Open Source Housing System for UK RSLs", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 716051}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charonhousing/", "video_url": null}
