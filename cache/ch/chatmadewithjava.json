A moderator/Admin can ban users from a client JAR using /Kick name or  \r\n/ban name , for example. \r\n\r\nThere are still functions to make, like sending historic logs of the chat to your email, print the users online, etc. Its all preety simple, since the whole chat already works with a login Capability. \r\n\r\nTo setup,for now,you will need to create the Database According to the Script and check the DataBases Classes / Dao Classes in Each JAR. \r\n\r\nI will be working on this but if you want to take the source code and improve it, feel free to. I did my best and i learned a lot with this.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n29/07/2013\r\n", "shortname": "chatmadewithjava", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Chat Project that contains A Client and Admin (Host) parts.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1917271}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chatmadewithjava/", "video_url": ""}
