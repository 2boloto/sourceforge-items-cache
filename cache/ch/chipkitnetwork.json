It currently supports just the ENC28J60 ethernet chip, but could easily be expanded to include other network chips.  It offers a full network stack, with TCP and UDP, along with the ability to have multiple ethernet connections.  Multiple sockets across multiple protocols are also possible.\r\n\r\nIt has been designed to have a very simple interface to take a lot of the drudgery out of ENC28J60 programming.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chipkitnetwork", "_id": "4ff83723b9363c45a100018b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 814815, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Network stack for the ChipKit UNO32 and MAX32", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Hardware :: Hardware Drivers", "shortname": "drivers", "fullname": "Hardware Drivers", "id": 292}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Embedded systems", "shortname": "embedded", "fullname": "Embedded systems", "id": 749}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "id": 238}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Other", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other", "id": 212}]}}
