In Chor, the behaviour of a system is written down as a global program (a choreography) where all the message exchanges between the participants are explicit. Choreographies are statically checked against protocol specifications, given as types, enabling type-directed global programming. Finally, Chor supports the automatic generation of systems from a choreography. With Chor, you do not have to worry about asynchronous communications or protocol compliance anymore. The language is based on strong theoretical bases, so that you can let its compiler do the jobs of checking your global programs and generating correct implementing code for you!", "summary": "A choreography programming language for concurrent systems", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 646828, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chor", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/carbonem/", "username": "carbonem", "name": "Marco Carbone"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/fmontesi/", "username": "fmontesi", "name": "Fabrizio Montesi"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "id": 8}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Plugins :: Eclipse", "fullname": "Eclipse", "shortname": "eclipse_plugins", "id": 583}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "id": 16}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Compilers", "fullname": "Compilers", "shortname": "compilers", "id": 48}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Distributed Computing", "fullname": "Distributed Computing", "shortname": "distributed_computing", "id": 308}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet", "fullname": "Internet", "shortname": "internet", "id": 87}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
