They require you to export lists, and then manage them seperately.\r\n\r\nChitkar wants to take you away from all that. You manage your membership database already, in your membership system. Chitkar lets you link your email campaign system to your existing membership system, so that the email management side of things doesn't double. Instead your communications people can concentrate on emailing, while your membership people can concentrate on membership.", "summary": "An email campaign management tool for member based organisations", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2106409, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chitkar", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jcleeland/", "username": "jcleeland", "name": "Jason Cleeland"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/restlessera/", "username": "restlessera", "name": "Ganesh Malla"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_home.png", "caption": "Home Screen", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_home.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_create.png", "caption": "Creating a newsletter", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_create.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_lists.png", "caption": "Newsletter management", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_lists.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_status.png", "caption": "Live status of outgoing emails", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_status.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_summary.png", "caption": "Summary screen showing read information", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chitkar/screenshot/screenshot_summary.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
