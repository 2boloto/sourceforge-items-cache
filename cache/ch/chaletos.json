The system that he tried was too different from what he was used to, there were too many new things and the old things were not where he expected. The goal of this project is to let anyone get used to Linux.\r\n    This system is not too different from Xubuntu, on which it is based, but ChaletOS has a style that everyone knows well, appealing simplicity and an impressive speed. All this will let them to fall in love with this system quickly. Because of its small hardware requirements it will revive some old machines and refresh others, not so old.\r\n    The name ChaletOS came from the style of the mountain houses in Switzerland. The concept of these houses is similar to the concept that we had while we made this system: simplicity, beauty and recognizability. Since we want the new users to feel at home, we hope this project will meet this goal.", "summary": "ChaletOS is a Xubuntu - based distribution.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2415690, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chaletos", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/extraleonard/", "username": "extraleonard", "name": "Dejan Petrovic"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/Laptop-main_1.png", "caption": "ChaletOS", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/Laptop-main_1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/Screenshot%20-%2006.png", "caption": "ChaletOS Purple theme", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/Screenshot%20-%2006.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/Screenshot%20-%2003.png", "caption": "ChaletOS Red theme", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/Screenshot%20-%2003.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/Tr1.png", "caption": "ChaletOS Blue theme", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/Tr1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/TrGreen.png", "caption": "ChaletOS Green theme", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/TrGreen.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/ChaletOSOrange.png", "caption": "ChaletOS Orange theme", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chaletos/screenshot/ChaletOSOrange.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "https://sites.google.com/site/chaletoslinux/home", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System", "fullname": "System", "shortname": "system", "id": 136}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}]}}
