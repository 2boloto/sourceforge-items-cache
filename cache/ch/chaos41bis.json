It was out of proportion. \r\n\r\nThe TrueCoin cryptocurrency corrects that. It binds its value to reality. Its unit value is a ratio between money and land area.\r\n\r\nWhen that ratio normalizes, the currency becomes available to the public.\r\n\r\nMore developers are needed.\r\n\r\nFor that you need inside access, which means the access protocol is made public now. \r\n\r\nIt is also the open-source cryptographic protocol.\r\n\r\nType in a formatted string as \"beacon\" and a number. Repeat once. When the identical string is produced, prepare to take note. When the identical string repeats, a name is added. This signals that the next line of text you type, is registered.
