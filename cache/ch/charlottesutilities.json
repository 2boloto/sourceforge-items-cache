I wanted to have some extra utilities and things for my server that I couldn't find in other mods, or if I could I was able to think of a different way that I would prefer to implement them. At its core, this mod pack is just a collection of utilities that I feel improve the game experience. Everything is fully configurable in the config file so you can change, enable, or disable whatever you feel is best for you!\r\n\r\nThe mod has quickly developed into one that's aimed primarily at the builders of the Minecraft community, and I plan to expand on that idea going into the future. My goal is to provide new, unique, and easy ways to allow players to construct whatever comes to their mind. I take feedback very seriously and if you have a good idea I won't hesitate to implement it.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Charlotte's Utilities is made possible by Full Effect Hosting", "summary": "Charlotte's Utilities mod for Minecraft Forge made by Sharshar", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2200472, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "devlog", "name": "blog", "label": "Development Log"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "charlotte_c_b", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "charlottesutilities", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/charlotte-c-b/", "username": "charlotte-c-b", "name": "Charlotte Brown"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/ON9cONj.png", "caption": "Layout Blocks in action", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/ON9cONj.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/UE1zTvh.png", "caption": "Compressed Coloured Powder", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/UE1zTvh.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/2TRhpOR.png", "caption": "Morph Brush in action", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/2TRhpOR.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/drG5JC0.png", "caption": "Paint Brush in action", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/drG5JC0.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/3NVTd4F.png", "caption": "Paint Brush GUI", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/charlottesutilities/screenshot/3NVTd4F.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "fullname": "Other License", "shortname": "other", "id": 196}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: XML-based", "fullname": "XML-based", "shortname": "db_api_xml", "id": 507}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "fullname": "SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "id": 508}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "id": 80}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Hobbies", "fullname": "Hobbies", "shortname": "hobbies", "id": 772}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Multiplayer", "fullname": "Multiplayer", "shortname": "multiplayer", "id": 774}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "fullname": "Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "id": 5}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "id": 906}]}}
