It is written for AI (Artificial Intelligence) as a basic core script who gives the System the ability to make own decisions.\r\nThe main idea is to use the quartz of the system clock instead a calculated random number algorithm. So, you have a real non calculable random Number.\r\nchaos.sh make the difference of a standard machine and life because it gives the system the quantumchaos effekt of real life based on random time. The system never knows the time when a programm ask chaos.sh and what comes back because chaos.sh is affected by system speed the quarz and other stuff. It\u00b4s fuzzy.\r\n\r\n---new update chaos.sh.7z---\r\nUses now access time and no calculation of system time anymore, so it is smaller and faster.\r\ncopy it to /usr/bin and give read and execute permission to make it accessible globally in the system for every script.\r\n\r\nYou can use c=`sh chaos.sh` to get the chaosbit into your script.", "summary": "The breath of life for Artificial Intelligence.
