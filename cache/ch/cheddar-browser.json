Users of Cheddar should switch to Ryouko, the other browser I've been maintaining. Ryouko is fairly similar to Cheddar in feel, and also offers a .EXE version for Windows. Although I will no longer maintain Cheddar, you can always fork it if you feel up to the task - it's open-source, after all. =)\r\n\r\nRyouko's project page is located at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ryouko/\r\n\r\nCheddar is a tabbed Web browser coded in Python and PyQt4. It was originally started by thebluex, so major thanks goes to him. Since the original project (located at http://code.google.com/p/cheddar-browser/) hasn't been updated for about 2 years now, I decided to fork it for fun.
