You decide on the betting frequency or the rate of betting, based on your winning or losing streak. If you are on a winning spree, increase the rate of bet. If you see that you are losing more, then decrease the betting frequency.\r\nThere are number of types of bets that you can make, depending on the scope and significance of the bet. The three prominent betting options are preflop betting, limping and over-limping.\r\nPREFLOP BETTING: While playing a poker Hold\u2019em game, the initial two bets that are made in the pot, are called the forced bet. These are also called as \u201cblinds\u201d, as the players will bet, without looking at their cards. After betting, they can fold or raise or call, without checking your card. The first person who checks the card opens or starts the game.\r\nLIMPING: Limping is a poker term used, when a player tries to play, betting a big blind.
