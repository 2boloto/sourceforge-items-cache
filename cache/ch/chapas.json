A typical round of Chapas starts by dealing 9 random cards to each player. Each of these cards represents movement points for the different bottlecaps. Afterwards, an auction takes place, where the players use their money (an initially set amount, that accumulates over different rounds), to buy the bottlecaps better suited to each player's cards. Finally the race phase starts, where the players use their cards, on their respective turn, to move the bottlecaps across the field, passing through each checkpoint (where they can restock their cards for money). The round ends when every player has reached the finish line, or ran out of cards.", "shortname": "chapas", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "3D turn-based bottlecap racing game with support for multi-players", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 639183}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chapas/", "video_url": ""}
