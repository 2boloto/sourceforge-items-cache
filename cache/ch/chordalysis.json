However, due to its exponential nature, previous approaches did not allow scale-up to more than a dozen variables. \r\nWe present here Chordalysis, a log-linear analysis method for big data. Chordalysis exploits recent discoveries in graph theory by representing complex models as compositions of triangular structures, also known as chordal graphs. Chordalysis makes it possible to discover the structure of datasets with thousands of variables on a standard desktop computer.\r\nAssociated papers at ICDM 2013, ICDM 2014 and SDM 2015 can be found at http://www.francois-petitjean.com/Research/\r\n\r\nYourKit is supporting Chordalysis open source project with its full-featured Java Profiler.\r\nYourKit is the creator of innovative and intelligent tools for profiling Java and .NET applications. http://www.yourkit.com", "shortname": "chordalysis", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@LeDataMiner", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Log-linear analysis (data modelling) for high-dimensional data", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1992366}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tutorial", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chordalysis/", "video_url": null}
