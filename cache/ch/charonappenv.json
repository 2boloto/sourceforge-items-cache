The \u201cCharon Application Environment\u201d contains things like: a middleware layer based on web services, update of users, user permissions, security and access levels, menu editor, letter production, report handling, email sending and many other support functions. It is designed to be very scalable and handle very large number of users using multiple application servers. \r\n\r\nThis software is aimed at an organization or company that wishes to develop an application but also wants to short-cut the development time by having a ready-made environment to bolt that application on to.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "charonappenv", "_id": "501e5fba1be1ce3cb5000159", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 844217, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "The application environment used by the Charon applications", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Oracle", "shortname": "db_net_oracle", "fullname": "Oracle", "id": 526}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "shortname": "db_net_pgsql", "fullname": "PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "id": 525}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Microsoft SQL Server", "shortname": "db_net_mssql", "fullname": "Microsoft SQL Server", "id": 530}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Non-Profit Organizations", "shortname": "nonprofit", "fullname": "Non-Profit Organizations", "id": 618}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Government", "shortname": "government", "fullname": "Government", "id": 569}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
