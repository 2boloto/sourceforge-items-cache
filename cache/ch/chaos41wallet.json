This includes earning recognition as a trader. This includes safe storage of chaOS41 value you own as a token is saved locally and needs to match identity and value owned, which if put on a USB stick on your person is as hard as security gets. Additional functions are created if your question is found true by a support group. This implies no extra conditions needed such as a minimal demand. That is commerce, while chaOS41 needs truth only once to validate a unit. This is limited by fact and act, meaning we can not exceed capacity, and creating bubbles is the job of a trader. More importantly, the chaOS41 wallet makes it our task to provide other validated currency to trade against. What currency that is and how it trades is our job to do. Math drives the selection of fit currencies and takes into account your business requirement to see only the currencies of which we calculated maximal profitabilty.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chaos41wallet", "_id": "521a674790954737ab303ad0", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1939232, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "end user access to chaOS41 value", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content", "shortname": "dynamic", "fullname": "Dynamic Content", "id": 92}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other License", "id": 196}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "fullname": "MySQL", "id": 524}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
