However, some musicians still need the simplicity of these old fellows in live shows.\r\n\r\nChuso's Free Soundfont Collection (ChusoCol) is a simple collection of instruments that would help every live musician to establish their own setup. It is the collection I particularly use and update, and the samples come from a variety of open resources, such as Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra (http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/), Salamander Grand Piano (http://freepats.zenvoid.org/Piano/) or the GeneralUser GS (http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php), as well as some samples by myself.\r\n\r\nIt is intended for live musicians who want the better sound with low requirements, in a library of ~300Mb. The library is still in alpha state, and improvements are being made. The final soundfont is compiled using Polyphone (http://www.polyphone.fr/)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "chusocol", "_id": "5456516cf1fd8d737ac45a9a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2355799, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Collection"}], "summary": "A free high quality soundfont collection for live setups", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio", "shortname": "sound", "fullname": "Sound/Audio", "id": 113}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Sound Synthesis", "shortname": "synthesis", "fullname": "Sound Synthesis", "id": 249}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Composition", "shortname": "composition", "fullname": "Composition", "id": 784}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V2.0", "shortname": "ccaslv2", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V2.0", "id": 869}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
