However, some musicians still need the simplicity of these old fellows in live shows.\r\n\r\nChuso's Free Soundfont Collection (ChusoCol) is a simple collection of instruments that would help every live musician to establish their own setup. It is the collection I particularly use and update, and the samples come from a variety of open resources, such as Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra (http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/), Salamander Grand Piano (http://freepats.zenvoid.org/Piano/) or the GeneralUser GS (http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php), as well as some samples by myself.\r\n\r\nIt is intended for live musicians who want the better sound with low requirements, in a library of ~300Mb. The library is still in alpha state, and improvements are being made. The final soundfont is compiled using Polyphone (http://www.polyphone.fr/)", "shortname": "chusocol", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A free high quality soundfont collection for live setups", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2355799}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Collection", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/chusocol/", "video_url": null}
