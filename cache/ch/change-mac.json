Changing MAC address of a machine is called spoofing a MAC address or faking a MAC address. \r\n\r\nThese are the reasons you should change the MAC address of your machine.\r\n For privacy - For instance when you are connecting to a Wi-Fi hotspot.\r\n To ensure interoperability - Some internet service providers bind their service to a specific MAC address; if the user then changes their network card or intends to install a router, the service won't work anymore. Changing the MAC address of the new interface will solve the problem.\r\n\r\nChanging MAC address is only temporary. Once you reboot your machine, the operating system reflects the physical MAC address burnt in your network card and not the MAC address you set.", "shortname": "change-mac", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Change your MAC address", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2182921}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Releases", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/change-mac/", "video_url": null}
