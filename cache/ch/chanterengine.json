IsoVenture(wrote in c++ and using SDL), when completed, will be a game all about civilization management(real time), strategic terrain manipulation (digging, creation, crafting, building, and more), tactical army movement (including individual unit control), and exploration. It will encompass a unique world with every game. All generated at game creation, no pre-made maps. Lands to explore and conquer so vast it will take many lifetimes of your men to do so. And other civilizations, with unique AI, who are growing in other parts of the world and may or may not be after the same goals you have in mind.\r\n\r\nGranted, the game is FAAAAAAARRRRR from complete, as it is just a hobby, but I do plan on spending quite a lot of time, overall, in molding it into a well rounded, complete and fun game.", "shortname": "chanterengine", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Wrote in c++ and using SDL.
