If your university or college is prone to such cases, then this software is suited for you and your institution. It enables signing in and signing out of laptops at the campus entrance(s).\r\nOnly students with registered laptops and who have been signed in can be allowed entrance. Only students who have been signed in and signed out can be allowed exit.\r\nThis software can easily be customized to fit any organization with such a need as described above. It is my hope that this software becomes useful to an individual or organization out there.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\ni. Download the package.\r\nii. Run the executable file.\r\niii. Source Code now available.\r\niv. Use the Wiki for any further inquiry.\r\n\r\nNB: Please use the \"External Link\" menus above to support this project in one way or another. PM me for other means. Any kind of support will be very much appreciated.
