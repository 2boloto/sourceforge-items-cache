Every day, it will download all pdf files from your favorite Arxiv RSS, and will then scan it to see if any authors from your favorite institute(s) are on there. If so, it will save the resulting index. The matched files are then parsed into a short list, featuring only the latest 4 preprints (which is ideal for a single TV screen in the coffee corner), and a long list which contains every paper in a clickable way. \r\n\r\nI provide this software as a demonstration on how we do it at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute. The script is run daily as a cron command. Feel free to take and modify this code any way you want. But if you are using it, I'd love to at least here from you and know I didn't put this up for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe program has no major prerequisites, except the Python package pyPdf. It is build for Python 2.6.x series, but will probably work on many others as well. \r\n", "shortname": "latest-on-arxiv", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Parse the latest Arxiv RSS stream and get your institute preprints", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1970645}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/latest-on-arxiv/", "video_url": ""}
