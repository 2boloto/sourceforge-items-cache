A key design objective is to use as little dedicated hardware as possible for communication between nodes in the network, and to be able to adapt the network topology in real-time so as to minimize the occurrence of collisions between packets. To achieve this, a protocol has been designed specifically for the task, and implemented in assembler for AVR microcontrollers. The project is currently at the stage of testing the protocol for bugs and implementing some simple devices which use it.", "shortname": "labmonkey", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Create networks of embedded devices for data logging/automation tasks.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 781591}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/labmonkey/", "video_url": ""}
