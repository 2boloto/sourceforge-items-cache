In particular, it allows the user to measure the volume of all distinguishable features in an image and to isolate and sort those particles. As the name implies, LAVA uses Lloyd's Algorithm, also known as k-means sorting, to identify a small set of volumes representative of the actual distribution of particle in the image.\r\n\r\nAlthough developed for determining feature volume, LAVA is also completely compatible with other types of image analysis, such as fluorescence intensity. Work is in progress to provide three-channel functionality, allowing comparison of relative intensity of red, green, and blue channels in multi-color images.", "shortname": "lavaafm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Lloyd's Algorithm-based Volumetric Analysis for AFM Images", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 799622}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lavaafm/", "video_url": ""}
