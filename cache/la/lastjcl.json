Java code working with collection interfaces such as List or Collection is inapplicable for arrays. Some libraries supply methods to work with object array. These methods are generic and built-in types int, boolean, long, short, byte, double, float suffer.\r\n\r\nThe number of scalar type is small and finite. There are realization of Iterable, Iterator, Collection, and List interfaces for each scalar type. Also the library gives such useful methods as contains and indexOf for objects with Iterable interface only.\r\n\r\nYeah. There is some stupidness because all implementations differ between each other only types and this code has 100% implicit coupling and duplications.
