It's a 2D motocross game similar to X-Moto, ActionSupercross and such. Some stability issues persist but mostly it's good already. I shall compile it soon for Windows: one of the problems is that Windows compilers must periodically be reinstalled, and that's annoying.\r\n\r\nUsing Lagrangians in games is not a well documented thing, but it allows to achieve exellent results in very little time, soon after a good parametrization of a given physical system was found. The problem is collisions... they are more problematic to do. The near-end of this little game is to get started with using Lagrangians in games; the far-end is to provide groung for creating a 3D rally game using Lagrange equations of motion, one that fixes certain shortcomings of the CTruck3D _Open .     \r\n\r\nAh very much thank to the Maxima project !! Without that program the calculations would have been impossible to do!
