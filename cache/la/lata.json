The primary concept is a logical circuit.  Physical components within a system are wired together and then logically configured to form circuits.  Each logical circuit acts as would any basic electrical circuit.  A switch closes and a message is delivered to the network.  All members of the circuit receive the message and process as needed.  This process may then result in a physical action (e.g. relay closure) or further network messages (e.g. groups).  Further details are covered in the Protocol Specification.  The system is fully expandable and provides scope to build a flexible, user friendly control system.", "shortname": "lata", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Distrubuted building control system based on logical circuits.", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1947768}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lata/", "video_url": ""}
