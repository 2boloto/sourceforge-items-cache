In particular, the current version of LASAGNE can compute the exact value of the diameter of a graph: the graph can be directed or undirected and it can be weighted or unweighted. Moreover, LASAGNE can compute an approximation of the distance distribution of an undirected unweighted graph. These two features are integrated within a graphical user interface along with other features, such as computing the maximum (strongly) connected component of a graph. The algorithms implemented in LASAGNE turn out to be extremely efficient when applied to real-world large networks.", "shortname": "lasagne-unifi", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A Java GUI application for computing distance measures of graphs", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 762269}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lasagne-unifi/", "video_url": ""}
