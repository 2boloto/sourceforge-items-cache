They can turn 360 degrees left and right, and there is a radar in the upper left corner that tells them where the ghosts are relative to them.  Pressing the \"up\" arrow key will shoot a bullet, and if that bullet hits a ghost then that ghost disappears and reappears somewhere else.  If a ghost gets to close to the player, then the player has been hit, and a player can only be hit 5 times before the game is over.  They are told how many ghosts they hit, how accurate they were with their shots, and how long they lasted, and a score is based off of these factors.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "termprojecthm", "_id": "4f9ed06b1be1ce17fc00025e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 760218, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A game in which the player fends off ghosts using a gun", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
