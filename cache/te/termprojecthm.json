They can turn 360 degrees left and right, and there is a radar in the upper left corner that tells them where the ghosts are relative to them.  Pressing the \"up\" arrow key will shoot a bullet, and if that bullet hits a ghost then that ghost disappears and reappears somewhere else.  If a ghost gets to close to the player, then the player has been hit, and a player can only be hit 5 times before the game is over.  They are told how many ghosts they hit, how accurate they were with their shots, and how long they lasted, and a score is based off of these factors.", "shortname": "termprojecthm", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A game in which the player fends off ghosts using a gun", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 760218}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/termprojecthm/", "video_url": ""}
