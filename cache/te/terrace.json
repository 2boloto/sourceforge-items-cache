Although its physical characteristics may vary to a great degree, a terrace will generally be larger than a balcony and will have an \"open-top\" facing the sky. Terraces are highly versatile in terms of functionality and can be used for a variety of activities including, but not limited to: gardening, relaxation, entertaining guests, sunbathing, and barbecuing. Sometimes, there is a hot tub, jacuzzi, or a small swimming pool on terraces. There may also be an outdoor kitchen or a barbecue grill.
