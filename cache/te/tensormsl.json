With more connections revealed and analogies drawn between multilinear algorithms and their linear counterparts, MSL has become an exciting area to explore for applications involving large-scale multidimensional (tensorial) data as well as a challenging problem for machine learning researchers to tackle. \r\n\r\nMSL-based dimensionality reduction employs either tensor-to-tensor projection (TTP) or tensor-to-vector projection (TVP). TTP finds a direct mapping from high-dimensional tensors to low-dimensional tensors of the same (or lower) order.
