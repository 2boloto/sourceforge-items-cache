It contains tools for analysis, tuning, macroscopic probing and simulations of distributed systems. Library of tools can be extended and everybody is encouraged to provide and share its tools with the community. \r\n\r\nThe main idea is to provide application designers ability to seamlessly use tools which are helpful to design self-organizing behavior. Designers can continue to use their domain tools such as favorable simulator and by pluging it into the framework can take advantage of distributed simulations in the grid, various analyzers, optimizers (particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithms, ...).\r\n\r\nSee Wiki pages for more information.", "shortname": "teeser", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Tool for Engineering Emergent Selforganizing bEhavioR", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 704672}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/teeser/", "video_url": ""}
