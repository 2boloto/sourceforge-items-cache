Completely in 2D. There are no any story; you playing as the red square, looking for keys around on a level. Your enemies are:\r\n\r\nIdiot: blue square with rotating arrows, can move only up or down.\r\nThe Drunken Bot: looks like player, but it`s green and it smiles to you. Walks in random direction, the same way like player.\r\nA turret: shots in random direction with a constant interval. Bullets can fly through the walls.\r\nThe Boss: randomly moves left or right at the top of level, fires from two guns. Starts raging, when his health becomes low.\r\nThere are no savegames between levels, so if you`ll lost all backups and die somewhere at 15th level (for example), you will be returned to the first level. At the game's begin you have five backups; collecting of a big green square will give you one more backup (aka 1-UP).", "shortname": "teststuff", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A simple 2D game.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 761708}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/teststuff/", "video_url": ""}
