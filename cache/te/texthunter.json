For example, in epidemiology, clinical researchers often need to review large numbers of electronic medical records to identify variables that describe the patient (symptomatology, medication status etc). This often a tedious process, increasing the difficulty and cost of research. To address this, TextHunter provides two key tools: \r\n\r\n- An efficient annotation interface to help rapidly code large volumes of documents\r\n\r\n- A means to automatically generate information extraction algorithms, so that manual review of the entire document set is unnecessary\r\n\r\nDesigned to run on desktop hardware, TextHunter is already being used in the UK Mental Health Biomedical Research centre (http://brc.slam.nhs.uk/) to speed research in several major projects. Fast, powerful and free, TextHunter is a general purpose information extraction tool, suitable for any domain.", "shortname": "texthunter", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "User friendly toolkit to extract structured data from free text.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2085285}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/texthunter/", "video_url": ""}
