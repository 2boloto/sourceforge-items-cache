T3 is easy to install and use application. T3 can be used from command line as well from its GUI. So a tester can get a flexibility to perform a test.\r\nT3 is a platform independent application. It can be used on Windows, Linux, or Solaris. With this tool you can test multiple protocols at same time. T3 uses XML as an input file that means to write test scripts in T3 there is no additional complex programming knowledge. The test script written for Windows instance can be used for Linux instances of T3.\r\nSound features of Total Testing Tool:\r\n\r\n    Developed in JAVA\r\n    T3 and its scripts can be used on any OS like windows, Linux, or Solaris.\r\n    All Protocols, Simulators in T3 has been developed based on Industry standards and RFCs.\r\n    T3 can act as a test tool or as a simulator at a same time.", "shortname": "techtlabs", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Total Testing Tool", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 646815}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/techtlabs/", "video_url": ""}
