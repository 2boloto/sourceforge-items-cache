T3 is easy to install and use application. T3 can be used from command line as well from its GUI. So a tester can get a flexibility to perform a test.\r\nT3 is a platform independent application. It can be used on Windows, Linux, or Solaris. With this tool you can test multiple protocols at same time. T3 uses XML as an input file that means to write test scripts in T3 there is no additional complex programming knowledge. The test script written for Windows instance can be used for Linux instances of T3.\r\nSound features of Total Testing Tool:\r\n\r\n    Developed in JAVA\r\n    T3 and its scripts can be used on any OS like windows, Linux, or Solaris.\r\n    All Protocols, Simulators in T3 has been developed based on Industry standards and RFCs.\r\n    T3 can act as a test tool or as a simulator at a same time.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "techtlabs", "_id": "4ee6118a1be1ce4e0b000bdd", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 646815, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Total Testing Tool", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing", "shortname": "testing", "fullname": "Testing", "id": 575}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "id": 606}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Quality Assurance", "shortname": "quality_assurance", "fullname": "Quality Assurance", "id": 565}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other License", "id": 196}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Telecommunications Industry", "shortname": "telecommunications", "fullname": "Telecommunications Industry", "id": 368}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "id": 537}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Management", "shortname": "management", "fullname": "Management", "id": 725}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Virtualization", "shortname": "virtualization", "fullname": "Virtualization", "id": 664}]}}
