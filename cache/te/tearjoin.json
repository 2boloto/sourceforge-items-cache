The same tool is used to combine all the pieces of the file to get the original file back as it is.\r\n\r\nCommon uses in real life:\r\n1. Bypass the maximum attachment size limit:\r\nSending a .exe or a larger file through email by bypassing the maximum attachment size limitation.\r\n\r\n2. Overcome the portable storage limitation:\r\nIf we are not having a sufficient portable storage to transfer, say a muvie of a bigger size, we can cut the muvie file into number of pieces, transfre them to target computer and combine the pieces to get the original muvie back.\r\n\r\n2. Save data securely/privacy:\r\nThe tear-join operation can be password protected. If we want our important files to be kept confidential, tear them down using password. No one can read the teared out files.
