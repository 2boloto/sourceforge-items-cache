TEACUP enables repeatable testing of different TCP algorithms over a range of emulated network path conditions, bottleneck rate limits and bottleneck queuing disciplines.\r\n\r\nTEACUP utilises a text-based configuration file to define experiments as combinations of parameters specifying desired network path and end host conditions. When multiple values are provided (e.g. for TCP congestion control algorithm), an experiment is made up of multiple tests.\r\n\r\nFor each experiment and test, TEACUP collects a range of data, such as tcpdump files of traffic seen  or TCP stack information (e.g. using Web10G). TEACUP also collects a variety of metadata from the end hosts and bottleneck router, such as the actual OS/kernel version(s) used.\r\n\r\nTEACUP also provides some simple tools for analysing the results of experiments, such as plotting a flow's experienced RTT over time.", "shortname": "teacup", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "TCP Experiment Automation Controlled Using Python", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2453923}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/teacup/", "video_url": null}
