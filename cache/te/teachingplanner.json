The objective was that the system could be installed specifically in the user university and run through the web browser as a local page or having the possibility of installing it in a university server (could be in any site, no need to be in the user university) so through the browser and an internet connection it could be used from anywhere (mainly in developing countries which is the target of the project). The project was initially thought for the Ngozi university in Burundi, so it tries to fulfill the requirements from that university, but the design is as open as it could be so it can be adapted to work on other universities.", "shortname": "teachingplanner", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Teaching planner tool to help universities in developing countries", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 644698}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/teachingplanner/", "video_url": ""}
