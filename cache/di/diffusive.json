Diffusive programming, defined by a set of six principles, is an approach for performing method-level, task-oriented distributed computing. In diffusive programming, any method can be marked for distribution, regardless of its signature. And marking a method is necessary and sufficient for its execution to be distributed. Distribution of tasks occurs through a network of nodes that can accept tasks and execute them, or forward them on. Nodes executing a task, load the required resources as needed, and cache them. The topology of the network of nodes can be anything that can be represented as a directed graph. Topologies can be tailored to solve specific problems. Diffusive is a Java refer- ence implementation of the six principles that define diffusive programming.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "diffusive", "_id": "505c83d9b9363c484353cd45", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 968192, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Task-oriented distributed computing framework", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "shortname": "development", "fullname": "Software Development", "id": 45}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "id": 606}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache License V2.0", "shortname": "apache2", "fullname": "Apache License V2.0", "id": 401}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
