Diffusive programming, defined by a set of six principles, is an approach for performing method-level, task-oriented distributed computing. In diffusive programming, any method can be marked for distribution, regardless of its signature. And marking a method is necessary and sufficient for its execution to be distributed. Distribution of tasks occurs through a network of nodes that can accept tasks and execute them, or forward them on. Nodes executing a task, load the required resources as needed, and cache them. The topology of the network of nodes can be anything that can be represented as a directed graph. Topologies can be tailored to solve specific problems. Diffusive is a Java refer- ence implementation of the six principles that define diffusive programming.", "shortname": "diffusive", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Task-oriented distributed computing framework", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 968192}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/diffusive/", "video_url": ""}
