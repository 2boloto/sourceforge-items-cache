The former is used to import images from digital cameras, while the latter is to select images to copy them or burn them on CD,  for example to make hardcopies. The main goal are ease of use and a slim and intuitive UI which can also be used by people with limited computer skills. The programs are made as\r\nan alternative to image organisers, for people who find image organisers too bloated, who don't need all the features and/or are confused by the complicated UI, or for users who don't want programs to snatch and organise everything for them which they prefer to organise themselves.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "digicam-tools", "_id": "5543e5727929e568a15d71fe", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2455393, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Tools for digital photographs: Easy import and copy of images", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics", "shortname": "graphics", "fullname": "Graphics", "id": 100}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "fullname": "Qt", "id": 479}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: German", "shortname": "german", "fullname": "German", "id": 279}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
