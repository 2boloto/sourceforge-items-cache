Hope to reduce practice effects and eliminate the need to use clinical assessments in research settings. Requires Java 7 or newer.  Note that this is a research tool, and was not intended (and not evaluated) for clinical assessment.\r\n\r\nFINAL VERSION: If you want more features, download the source and hack it yourself.\r\n\r\nEthics Note: Since this does not diagnose anything, label results as normal/abnormal, contain pre-made stimuli or anything from a published assessment, and neither tries to teach the task nor seems to do so (as some commercial products claim to do) I believe it is safe and acceptable in the public domain.
