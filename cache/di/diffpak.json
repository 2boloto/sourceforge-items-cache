Unlike other tools, e.g. xdelta3, it searches for matching data through the whole source file, even if it weights several gigabytes, while using much less memory (with default configuration approx 25x less than the size of the source file). Output files are not compressed, so you can use any compressor you like with great results.\r\nIt is quite fast for very similar files (about the speed of hdd, however it reads input files twice) and not much worse on files with lots of differences.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "diffpak", "_id": "506ed6491be1ce195ef13780", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bug Tracker"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 995833, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A huge files block differential compressor", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving", "shortname": "archiving", "fullname": "Archiving", "id": 19}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving :: Compression", "shortname": "compression", "fullname": "Compression", "id": 42}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving :: Backup", "shortname": "backup", "fullname": "Backup", "id": 137}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
