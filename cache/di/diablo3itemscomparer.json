Yes it compare all your character in the profile and tell you what to do with the item you find and with all items you have in your stash. Even with the gems you have. I create it for myself at first and trying to do all combination possible like a chess game, but I find it's going to take forever or the whole life to get a simple answer. So I tweak it to get a reasonable fast time respond. Now it's working good enough and I want to share it with you. It's made in C# 4.5. Yeah, it's already working good in the like of the alpha stage and I like to find people willing to continue to this project. So if you are ready just let me know and I'll give proper authorization for that. It's my first time in sourceforge. Well I'll try my best.
