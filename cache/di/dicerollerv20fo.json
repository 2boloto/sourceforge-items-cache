Skype announced that they are discontinuing support for the Skype API, which the project depends on in order to read chat message data. Unfortunately, there isn't an alternative mechanism currently available to that would support the diceroller's functionality. This project is essentially on hiatus until a new API or other means of retrieving chat data from Skype becomes available.\r\n\r\nThank you all for downloading. It was fun to work on this project, and I hope to work on it more.\r\n\r\nAugust 3rd 2013 update:\r\n\r\nDiceRoller v2.0 is now v2.1! The dice roll parsing and result mechanism has been offloaded to Lua, The current script is bare-bones, but more features will be added over time, and you can add them yourself without the need for downloading/compiling source code.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1 is currently in beta.
