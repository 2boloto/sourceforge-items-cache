We present a new paradigm for securing interdomain routing that bypasses the obstacles facing today's agenda. Unlike the  hierarchical RPKI approach to certifying IP prefixes, our design is flat, decentralized, fully-automated, and avoids dependency on a single root-of-trust. Moreover, in contrast to proposed secure routing protocols (e.g., BGPSEC and soBGP), our design is easily deployable and, in particular, does not require changing/replacing legacy BGP routers. We present the results of security analysis, extensive simulations, and experiments with a prototype implementation. Our results suggest that it is remarkably effective even with a modest number of adopting parties.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "disco-sidr", "_id": "54c53808c4d104558e9879d1", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2399405, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
