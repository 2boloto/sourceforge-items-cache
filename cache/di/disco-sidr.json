We present a new paradigm for securing interdomain routing that bypasses the obstacles facing today's agenda. Unlike the  hierarchical RPKI approach to certifying IP prefixes, our design is flat, decentralized, fully-automated, and avoids dependency on a single root-of-trust. Moreover, in contrast to proposed secure routing protocols (e.g., BGPSEC and soBGP), our design is easily deployable and, in particular, does not require changing/replacing legacy BGP routers. We present the results of security analysis, extensive simulations, and experiments with a prototype implementation. Our results suggest that it is remarkably effective even with a modest number of adopting parties.", "shortname": "disco-sidr", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2399405}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/disco-sidr/", "video_url": null}
