Digital Villages are then interlinked to form networks of larger communities.\r\n  Each Digital Village serves as a social network hub for it's own community.  The Digital Village concept is based on the idea of trusted relationships.  For example, parents have a large level of trust (and control) over their own children's village membership and activity.  A selected committee, the Village Council, holds the trust of the community at large. Villages decide their level of trust for other villages. Each citizen's authentication and identity are the responsibility of his or her home village.\r\n  This site is the repository of code for a Village server.", "shortname": "digitalvillage", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "This is the server software for an instance of a Digital Village.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1087164}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/digitalvillage/", "video_url": ""}
