We're looking for you to write a computer program in C#, C++ or Java to solve a programming problem.\r\n\r\nIf you want to enter, you must submit your code via email to dhbolton@hotmail.com with the subject \"Dice Coding Challenge 1\" between Oct. 1 and Oct. 31, 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Problem:\r\n\r\nConsider all the nine digit integers where each digit 1-9 occurs only once. The lowest of these numbers is 123456789, the next is 123456798 and the highest is 987654321. There are 362,880 such numbers if I have my math correct. It\u2019s 9! (9 Factorial) ie 362,880 different numbers.\r\n\r\nIf the numbers are ordered starting from the highest to the lowest, you have to write a program that returns the 100,000th in this sequence. So the first five are these:\r\n\r\n    1) 987654321\r\n\r\n    2) 987654312\r\n\r\n    3) 987654231\r\n\r\n    4) 987654213\r\n\r\n    5) 987654132\r\n\r\nFor more info, visit: http://news.dice.com/2013/10/01/coding-challenge-046/", "shortname": "dicecodingchallengeoct2013", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "This is the first coding challenge in a new series by Dice News", "tools": [{"label": "Entries", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1968288}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dicecodingchallengeoct2013/", "video_url": ""}
