In many cases we spend more than 2 hrs/day. The time increases if there are more such parallel releases and at the end of the day 1 developer does it as full time job and has zero productivity. I thought of adding value here. This just gets the diff files. Can be used for Static code analysis like PMD to do PMD only for the delta.\r\n\r\nThe current status of the project is in Development\".
