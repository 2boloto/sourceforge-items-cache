It scans the directory information and store in a file.  This allows two computers to be scanned at a different time and even in two different country and allows the comparison to be carried out at a different time and place.  This allows terabytes of disk with millions of files and directories to be compared.\r\n\r\nA sub feature is the capability to report the size of every sub-directory trees in the scan.  It becomes useful when you want to clean up 2 TB external hard drive and want to know which sub-directory trees is the biggest so you can start tackling those first", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dirtree", "_id": "50ba72ce0594ca1ad4f0059e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1141706, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Off-line non-networked computers directories comparison utility", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 7 - Inactive", "shortname": "inactive", "fullname": "7 - Inactive", "id": 358}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: File Management", "shortname": "file_management", "fullname": "File Management", "id": 601}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
