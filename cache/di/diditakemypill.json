I tried using one of those containers which were divided in days where you would put your pills but that didn't work out very well. So I set out to develop this Mini Program in VB.NET initially for myself, but then I saw its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed to help people that need to take track of their pills and when they took them. In the future it will incorporate a more User Friendly UI and easier for people with little to no experience on computers. It would be a good idea to port it into Linux. \r\n\r\nPROJECT CREATED ON 20/05/2013", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "diditakemypill", "_id": "519a986204161f77c8f59259", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1790201, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Did I Take My Pills?", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
