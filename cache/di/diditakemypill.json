I tried using one of those containers which were divided in days where you would put your pills but that didn't work out very well. So I set out to develop this Mini Program in VB.NET initially for myself, but then I saw its usefulness.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed to help people that need to take track of their pills and when they took them. In the future it will incorporate a more User Friendly UI and easier for people with little to no experience on computers. It would be a good idea to port it into Linux. \r\n\r\nPROJECT CREATED ON 20/05/2013", "shortname": "diditakemypill", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Did I Take My Pills?", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1790201}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/diditakemypill/", "video_url": ""}
