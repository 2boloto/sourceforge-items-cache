In order to initialize downstream analysis, taxonomy assignment becomes a very important and critical step. In the recent years, many different techniques have been proposed for microbial profiling that can be divided into two main categories: composition-based and similarity-based method. To validate or compare different algorithms, calcula-tion of accuracy with cross-validation is commonly utilized. Since microbial organisms possess phylogenetic differences that can be extracted from their original DNA sequences, the method of accuracy that regards classification results as only correct and incorrect is not sufficient. \r\nWe utilize four metrics, consistent positive, consistent negative, divergent positive and divergent positive to decompose classification accuracies acquired from two commonly used classifiers.", "shortname": "diversitycomparison", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Diversity comparison between taxonmic assignment results", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2207817}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/diversitycomparison/", "video_url": null}
