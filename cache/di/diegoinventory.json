This tracking also had to include a log history of where it had been and any work which had been done to it.\r\n\r\nEach item has a chronological log to track maintenance and so on as well as attachments, item locations and users backed from the DB.\r\n\r\nWith parent item support, sub-components can be shown, for example, a computer and a hard disk are listed in the database, both with their own histories. The computer then requires a new hard disk, instead of deleting the tracking for the hard disk and only tracking the computer, the entry for the hard disk simply says that it's parent item is the computer.", "shortname": "diegoinventory", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "OpenSource Inventory Management", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 716042}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/diegoinventory/", "video_url": ""}
