It uses the --link-dest option to create hard links to files that have not changed.  Using this technique, each run results in a *full backup* even though the backup process used is incremental (only the files that changed since the last backup).  \r\n\r\nThis paradigm is sometimes called\r\nforever incremental backups.  This utility exists because I wrote it a long time ago in reaction to the slow, cumbersome pace of the dirvish project.   It has been in production for years and slowly features have been added.  \r\n\r\nThe snapshots--called boxes--of files and folders are arranged by date and time.  The boxes are stored in vaults (one for each server) and the vaults are stored in a bank (the top level folder).\r\n\r\nThe key difference between this and other utilities:  discremental is a few bash scripts that wrap around rsync.  They are meant to make using rsync easier--not replace or hide it from the user.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "discremental", "_id": "53c45a83909547735786c8ec", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2283464, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "forever incremental hard disk based backups", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
