It uses the --link-dest option to create hard links to files that have not changed.  Using this technique, each run results in a *full backup* even though the backup process used is incremental (only the files that changed since the last backup).  \r\n\r\nThis paradigm is sometimes called\r\nforever incremental backups.  This utility exists because I wrote it a long time ago in reaction to the slow, cumbersome pace of the dirvish project.   It has been in production for years and slowly features have been added.  \r\n\r\nThe snapshots--called boxes--of files and folders are arranged by date and time.  The boxes are stored in vaults (one for each server) and the vaults are stored in a bank (the top level folder).\r\n\r\nThe key difference between this and other utilities:  discremental is a few bash scripts that wrap around rsync.  They are meant to make using rsync easier--not replace or hide it from the user.", "shortname": "discremental", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "forever incremental hard disk based backups", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2283464}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/discremental/", "video_url": null}
