Although CLI driven, I have found it more useful that many other types of diagnostics for disk, controller and driver development than GJI based diagnostics. The command forms are terse, and it allows either use as an immediate mode debugger of drives or it can be used to form full testing scripts.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly compact at 4069 lines for the main module, and features plug in IO modules at about 500 lines each for both Windows and Linux, and DOS/BIOS.\r\n\r\nThe project has been running at 6-20 downloads per week.
