For the execution of an agentmodel DistAgent offers four different simulators:\r\n\r\na classic sequential simulator, two  conservative parallel and distributed simulators implementing the \"Conditional Event Approach\" described in \"The conditional-event approach to distributed simulation\" by Chandy and Sherman and the \"Simple Synchronous Protocol\" described by Fujimoto in \"Parallel and Distributed Simulation Systems\" respectively and an optimistic parallel and distributed simulator implementing  a window-based variant of the \"Time Warp System\" described in \"Virtual Time\" by Jefferson\r\n\r\nDistAgents main advantage is the possibility to create a model once and then run it with each one of the simulators. A user can therefore choose the synchronization protocol best suited for a specific simulation model without the need to change the model.\r\n\r\nAPI-documentation: http://distagent.sourceforge.net/api/\r\n", "shortname": "distagent", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A framework for parallel and distributed agend-based simulations", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1932114}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/distagent/", "video_url": ""}
