Also batch processing is one of the main guiding tenets behind the \u201cGetting things done\u201d process.\r\nWith this application we plan to tap into the reservoir of knowledge about the user of the smart phone for an example the working patterns, e-mails, social networks, calendars, reminders, to-do lists etc. which is stored in the phone itself and identify patterns in the tasks and suggest batches of actions to be performed based on the users current context. This application will be smart enough to take that necessary initiative and suggest the next step for the user which is not available in any of the current applications that is in the market up to now.", "shortname": "novi", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/groups/197496030388307/", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2112823}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/novi/", "video_url": null}
