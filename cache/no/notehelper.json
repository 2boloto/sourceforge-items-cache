It's reason for being is to tell you what the frequency value of notes is [plus or minus 0.5hz]. And while it's feature set is limited, we all dislike bloatware, don't we?\r\nOne of the best parts is that it's portable\u2014it doesn't have many dependencies at all, so you can carry it around on your portable media with you where ever you go.", "shortname": "notehelper", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1207560}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/notehelper/", "video_url": ""}
