It brings the best of Android together with a whole new marketplace of programs developed solely for the Nova platform. It installs and operates just like a launcher, however it holds much more power and opportunity, as it doesn't stop there. Besides being a refined gateway for your existing Android applications and games, it is an environment of it's own- for smart phones and tablets alike- with it's own features and it's own set of rules and options, including new accessibility features debuting in Nova exclusively, to make the most of your device. For the everyday user, its a fresh and fun experience that brings your device new life. For the professional, its a more manageable  and practical environment. For developers, it is an inexpensive new world, waiting for you to shape it. Nova is the future of Android, and it needs you.", "shortname": "novaoe", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/novaforandroid", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Nova is an operating environment that redefines Android.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1933359}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/novaoe/", "video_url": ""}
