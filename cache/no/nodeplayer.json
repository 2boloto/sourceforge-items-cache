This is accomplished using a unique concept called \"nodes\". A node is like a folder, except that it's contents are determined by ID3v2 tags, meaning that a song may appear in multiple nodes. A node may contain songs, nodes, or groups of nodes. Unlike a traditional tag-based music player, users can organize their Celtic and pirate-themed music using a custom culture tag, hide albums of artists with an empty album-artist tag, separate their soundtracks into movies and games, or anything else they can imagine.
