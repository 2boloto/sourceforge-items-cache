Shogun is an old boardgame that was invented by Teruo Matsumoto. It is played by two players. The game is like chess, only that the figures can only move within a radius of their random number. If the Shogun, which is a special figure that can only have the numbers 1 or 2, was hit, the game is over. The other figures can have numbers from 1 to 4.", "shortname": "jogun", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Shogun written in Java", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2253685}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jogun/", "video_url": null}
