Shogun is an old boardgame that was invented by Teruo Matsumoto. It is played by two players. The game is like chess, only that the figures can only move within a radius of their random number. If the Shogun, which is a special figure that can only have the numbers 1 or 2, was hit, the game is over. The other figures can have numbers from 1 to 4.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jogun", "_id": "539336bc1be1ce496d51d837", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2253685, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "Shogun written in Java", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
