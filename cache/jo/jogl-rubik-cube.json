The library used is JOGL : a Java Binding for OpenGL.\r\n\r\nDuring his developement stage, this project will be tested under Ubuntu and Windows (at least Windows XP) OS, and on different graphics card (for now : ATI RADEON HD4330 -> quite new, and Integrated VIA Unichrome S3G K8M800 -> old)\r\n\r\nPlease notice that no download is given for Mac computers, because I had not the possibility to test the result, but you have the possibility to build it  : simply \"imitate\" on of the ant jar builder files, download the necessary files at jogamp.org, and build. This procedure is described in the wiki : search for \"building jar\" inside the wiki.\r\n\r\nThe current version lets you play with a solved RubikCube at startup. Please, as there is no splashscreen, wait a few moment at startup ...\r\n\r\nThe icon is a screenshot taken from the 0.3.2 version.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jogl-rubik-cube", "_id": "4e94408cb9363c18c000092f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 607772, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "This project aim to implement the Erno's RubikCube in Java", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
