The library used is JOGL : a Java Binding for OpenGL.\r\n\r\nDuring his developement stage, this project will be tested under Ubuntu and Windows (at least Windows XP) OS, and on different graphics card (for now : ATI RADEON HD4330 -> quite new, and Integrated VIA Unichrome S3G K8M800 -> old)\r\n\r\nPlease notice that no download is given for Mac computers, because I had not the possibility to test the result, but you have the possibility to build it  : simply \"imitate\" on of the ant jar builder files, download the necessary files at jogamp.org, and build. This procedure is described in the wiki : search for \"building jar\" inside the wiki.\r\n\r\nThe current version lets you play with a solved RubikCube at startup. Please, as there is no splashscreen, wait a few moment at startup ...\r\n\r\nThe icon is a screenshot taken from the 0.3.2 version.", "shortname": "jogl-rubik-cube", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "This project aim to implement the Erno's RubikCube in Java", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 607772}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jogl-rubik-cube/", "video_url": ""}
