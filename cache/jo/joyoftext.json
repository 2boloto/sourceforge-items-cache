The capacity of jot is pretty good but insufficient for the largest of these - jot has an optional filtering feature that can be used to extract the elements required to answer your question.\r\n\r\nAlthough it's natural home is large CAD files, jot is equally useful for extracting information and generating reports and summaries from any kind text file.
