We will be developing the kernel for a new OS which will eventually lead to our company producing the first console with an open source OS. This will mean that the gamers, who may end up being some of you, will have full control over the OS the console they own runs. Now this is all well and good but, who are we, you may ask. We are a group of dreamers gone businessmen. Our company, FPSI Computer Technologies, is a new venture that hopes to be very successful into the far future. We will make computer hardware and software as well as apps, game consoles, and pretty much anything else we can come up with.
