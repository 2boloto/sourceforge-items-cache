The code has been written in the shortest possible time and hence does not follow best and/or recommended programing practices. It could be improved in lots of areas by using threads, migrating custom types to classes and so on. Consider this as a starting point for developing your own project (fork).\r\n\r\nJoomla! Template Toolbar is developed to be a simple utility for Joomla! template developers. Main goal was to make a sort of stand-alone replacement for various extensions and plug-ins designed especially for more complex and commercial web editors. Thus, this program can be used with any program that can open, edit and save plain text.\r\n\r\nPlease support further program development by donating via Bitcoin (http://bit.ly/1hWvpxJ).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "joomlatt", "_id": "50e041740594ca636fbd19a3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1204353, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Joomla!
