Instead, HDMI-CEC Tray makes use of your HDTV's built-in CEC technology to control your PC. You will be able to control Mediacenter, VLC, MPC-HC, MediaPortal or XBMC as well as Powerpoint, to name a few.\r\n\r\nWith HDMI-CEC Tray, you can navigate your HTPC menus, play and pause music, or fast-forward movies using only the TV remote. It's even possible to make the TV power on and switch to the right HDMI input automatically every time your HTPC starts.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hdmicectray", "_id": "50bc9e2224b0d91f298e2b25", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1144417, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Use your TV remote to control Windows applications", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
