The author has a high-tech, stainless steel version of this setup with pump and valves.\r\nPresently the software runs on a Linux controller (ARM based) and with a certain display HW. It is also being ported to a standard Linux PC with standard display. The project contains an abstraction layer to make all sorts of porting to other target platforms easier.\r\nThe BSAC project includes documentation for at least two complete setups (57L and 210L) with actual pumps, valves, fixtures, brewing pots etc.\r\nBSAC is the brain in the intelli-brew system, see http://intelli-brew.com/", "summary": "Brewing System Automation Controller", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "bsac", "name": "git", "label": "BSAC"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1389318, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bsac", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kallipals/", "username": "kallipals", "name": "Karl P\u00e1lsson"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://intelli-brew.com/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "fullname": "Other License", "shortname": "other", "id": 196}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Education", "fullname": "Education", "shortname": "education", "id": 71}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Home Automation", "fullname": "Home Automation", "shortname": "homeauto", "id": 796}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "fullname": "Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "id": 5}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}]}}
