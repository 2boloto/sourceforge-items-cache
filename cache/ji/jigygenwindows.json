Gone are the days of writing complex xml configurations to wire together components and you definitely won't miss managing dependencies or creating DAO's... just fire up Jigy Generator and fill in the form fields and let it construct your project with ease! The resulting project will be a Java web application with a Spring Framework configured to run in Netbeans. The project is annotation-based and provides dependency injection of project resources and simple annotation-based transaction management. Your created project will be already configured to connect to your project's database and to return Json responses when required. Also, the login and file upload modules will be fully functional immediately upon project creation. We promise once you've used a Jigy Generated project, you will never want to start from scratch again!!!", "shortname": "jigygenwindows", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The simplest way to generate a java application.
