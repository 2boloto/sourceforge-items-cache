You can control the player (for example pause or stop the playback), it is possible to read and edit playlists and tracks, and a lot of other stuff. \r\n\r\nJITCA is based on the iTunes COM interface which is provided by Apple. To allow communication with iTunes accross the COM interface the Java COM Bridge Jacob is utilized. \r\n\r\nFurthermore the API is divided into two parts. The first part (which is called \"Basic\") consists of classes and interfaces to access the interface provided by Apple. This part contains everything which is part of the original COM interface. But unfortunately the interface is partially not well structured and complex. Because of this there is the second part of the API. This \"Extended\" API encapsulates the original API and provides easier utiliziation.
