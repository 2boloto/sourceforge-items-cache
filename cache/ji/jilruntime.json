The language is quite similar to object-oriented high-level languages like Java and C#.\r\n\r\nThe library is entirely self-sufficient and ANSI C compliant. It's main purpose is to be embedded in any application to allow automation of that application through scripting.\r\n\r\nAn integrated C++ binding code generator allows you to create bindings for your application's classes in seconds. The integrated HTML documentation generator allows you to create documentation for your native bindings in seconds.\r\n\r\nThe project is released under the zlib/libpng license. It has been in development for over 10 years and offers some powerful features.\r\n\r\nExtensive information, documentation, articles and code examples can be found at the developer blog.\r\n", "shortname": "jilruntime", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An object-oriented script language to embed in any application", "tools": [{"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "About", "mount_point": "about", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 129384}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jilruntime/", "video_url": null}
