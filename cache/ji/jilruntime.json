The language is quite similar to object-oriented high-level languages like Java and C#.\r\n\r\nThe library is entirely self-sufficient and ANSI C compliant. It's main purpose is to be embedded in any application to allow automation of that application through scripting.\r\n\r\nAn integrated C++ binding code generator allows you to create bindings for your application's classes in seconds. The integrated HTML documentation generator allows you to create documentation for your native bindings in seconds.\r\n\r\nThe project is released under the zlib/libpng license. It has been in development for over 10 years and offers some powerful features.\r\n\r\nExtensive information, documentation, articles and code examples can be found at the developer blog.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jilruntime", "_id": "517696a134309d5befdd3ac2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "about", "name": "link", "label": "About"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 129384, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}], "summary": "An object-oriented script language to embed in any application", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "id": 12}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Object Oriented", "shortname": "swdev_oo", "fullname": "Object Oriented", "id": 562}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Compilers", "shortname": "compilers", "fullname": "Compilers", "id": 48}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Interpreters", "shortname": "interpreters", "fullname": "Interpreters", "id": 49}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Virtual Machines", "shortname": "virtual_machines", "fullname": "Virtual Machines", "id": 610}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: zlib/libpng License", "shortname": "zlib", "fullname": "zlib/libpng License", "id": 195}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
