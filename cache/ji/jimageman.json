After using many other fine manager applications I found some things I wanted in an image manager that didn't exist in just one manager so I tried to create one that had all the features that I liked in one manager.\r\n\r\nOne notable feature is the meta data or tags are stored in the image file itself so that when you move your image library the metadata and all the tagging work you did goes with the images.\r\n\r\nIt is not perfect but it has been in use for years on my machine and I thought it time to share and see what other developers could bring to it.
