Michigan-style LCS algorithms constitute a unique class of algorithms that distribute learned patterns over a collaborative population of of individually interpretable IF:THEN rules, allowing them to flexibly and effectively describe complex and diverse problem spaces. ExSTraCS was primarily developed to address problems in epidemiological data mining to identify complex patterns relating predictive attributes in noisy datasets to disease phenotypes of interest.  ExSTraCS combines a number of recent advancements into a single algorithmic platform.  It can flexibly handle (1) discrete or continuous attributes, (2) missing data, (3) balanced or imbalanced datasets, and (4) binary or many classes.  A complete users guide for ExSTraCS is included.
