It has been designed as a communication and coordination tool to keep in track the execution of complex exercises with large number of injects and players. \r\n\r\nIt enables the exchange of events and reports among users by managing a Master Event List (MSEL); massively injecting events; and collecting feedback from the exercise players. EXITO is web based and can be integrated with a Content Management System (CMS) like Drupal.\r\n\r\nEXITO can be used:\r\n-by exercise moderators to run an exercise scenario in a timely and ordered fashion, injecting events to the users through the web interface;\r\n-by exercise players to view injected events and provide feedback in a centralized repository;\r\n-by exercise observers to view the way an exercise progresses.\r\n\r\nIf you use  EXITO we would appreciate feedback about your  experience by email (use \"Contact EXITO\" button)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "exito", "_id": "5229a13ad46bb44ee09b5d2c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "contact", "name": "link", "label": "Contact EXITO admins"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1947376, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "the EXercise event Injection TOolkit", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Testing", "shortname": "testing", "fullname": "Testing", "id": 73}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: Synchronization", "shortname": "synchronization", "fullname": "Synchronization", "id": 823}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "shortname": "php", "fullname": "PHP", "id": 183}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: European Union Public License", "shortname": "eupublicense", "fullname": "European Union Public License", "id": 843}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "fullname": "MySQL", "id": 524}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "id": 866}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
