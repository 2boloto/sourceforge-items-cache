EXITO is web based and can be integrated with a Content Management System (CMS) like Drupal.\r\n\r\nEXITO can be used:\r\n-by exercise moderators to run an exercise scenario in a timely and ordered fashion, injecting events to the users through the web interface;\r\n-by exercise players to view injected events and provide feedback in a centralized repository;\r\n-by exercise observers to view the way an exercise progresses.\r\n\r\nIf you use  EXITO we would appreciate feedback about your  experience by email (use \"Contact EXITO\" button)", "shortname": "exito", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "the EXercise event Injection TOolkit", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Contact EXITO admins", "mount_point": "contact", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1947376}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/exito/", "video_url": null}
