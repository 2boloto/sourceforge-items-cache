You just enter your own protocol, press \u201cstart\u201d and you do not have to worry about timers anymore, especially when you already have your hands full with your protocol. If something goes wrong during your experimental procedure, just press \u201cpause\u201d (to pause the timer) or \u201creset\u201d (to start all over again).\r\nOf course, the program has a much broader area of application than experiments only.", "shortname": "exptimer", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An easy-to-use timer to facilitate complex, multi-step protocols.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1181980}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/exptimer/", "video_url": ""}
