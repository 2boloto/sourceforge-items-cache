(for the 1st datablock) is choosen to represent a 0 or an odd blocknr. to represent an 1. For the remaining blocks of the cover file till the end of the code is reached, \r\nan adjacent blocknr. represents the same bit as the previous one and a non-adjacent blocknr. (a block will be skipped) a negated previous bit. \r\n\r\nIt's necessary to use a partition with enough adjacent free blocks (code length + holes for fragmentation) within a blockgroup, for this algorithm to work correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING: This is experimental software and could cause crashes or data loss!", "shortname": "ext2infohidingmod", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Information Hiding Modification for EXT2", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2369800}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ext2infohidingmod/", "video_url": null}
