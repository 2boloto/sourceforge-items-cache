Using ExpenseLogger you can log your daily expenses and get a brief statistical analysis. ExpenseLogger also makes a low level trend analysis giving you estimations for your monthly and yearly projected spend amounts. You can get statistics in a tabular format as well as a graphical format. You also get average and total spend amounts for the ongoing month and year. \r\n\r\nFor convenience, your expenses can be divided into categories like Food, Grocery, Transport etc. which come prebuilt with the system. What's good is that you are not limited to these categories alone and you can always add new categories of your own. You can also rename and delete categories as per your convenience. \r\n\r\nExpenseLogger also facilitates generation of tabular and graphical reports.\r\n\r\nStable: http://expenselogger.cloudapp.net\r\nCredentials: UID: test, PWD:test123\r\n\r\nNote: We have moved from SVN to HG for source control.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "expenselogger", "_id": "4e9f6f231be1ce311a0001e2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 612783, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "hg", "name": "hg", "label": "Hg"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A web based expense logging and monitoring system", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Financial :: Personal finance", "shortname": "personalfinance", "fullname": "Personal finance", "id": 811}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: ASP.NET", "shortname": "asp_dot_net", "fullname": "ASP.NET", "id": 589}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Affero GNU Public License", "shortname": "agpl", "fullname": "Affero GNU Public License", "id": 670}, {"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V3.0", "shortname": "ccaslv3", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V3.0", "id": 870}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "fullname": "SQL-based", "id": 508}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
