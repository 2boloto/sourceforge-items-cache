While there is a provision to change the name, what gets used in formulas is still the automatic name that was generated. \r\n\r\nWhile this is not a great pain in normal circumstances, when you switch to using OLAP cubes (Powerpivot) and need to write cube formulas- You REALLY miss this one. \r\n\r\nThe program is quick add in to excel that lets you change the Programmatic name  of a slicer along with the Display Name and the Caption. \r\n\r\nIt is so simple and fast that once its there on your Quick Access Tool Bar, this is where you would head to even to change Slicer captions.\r\n\r\nProgram has been tested clean and very compact. No Performance Degradations.  \r\n\r\nNo ADs and completely free.
