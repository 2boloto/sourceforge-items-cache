D-SQL language could be used to script anything for dynamodb locally and committed to Amazon Cloud once the script is ready. Based on the terminology and convenient use of T-SQL , D-SQL is a derivative of that language. Methodology did not change. Write your own D-SQL scripts as you used to do for T-SQL and test it. Once the script is ready then commit it to the DYNOMDDB using dsqlcmd.exe tool. This project is open source and written in C# and should be cross platform. Windows version will be implemented first and along with dsqlcmd utlity. Please send requests to http://sourceforge.net/p/d-sql/tickets/?source=navbar for further enhancements. Also if you would like to join to the project kindly send me your requests. I would be glad to add you to the project.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contributions,\r\n\r\nsaids.", "shortname": "d-sql", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "DYNAMODB SQL", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2293802}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/d-sql/", "video_url": null}
