D-SQL language could be used to script anything for dynamodb locally and committed to Amazon Cloud once the script is ready. Based on the terminology and convenient use of T-SQL , D-SQL is a derivative of that language. Methodology did not change. Write your own D-SQL scripts as you used to do for T-SQL and test it. Once the script is ready then commit it to the DYNOMDDB using dsqlcmd.exe tool. This project is open source and written in C# and should be cross platform. Windows version will be implemented first and along with dsqlcmd utlity. Please send requests to http://sourceforge.net/p/d-sql/tickets/?source=navbar for further enhancements. Also if you would like to join to the project kindly send me your requests. I would be glad to add you to the project.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contributions,\r\n\r\nsaids.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "d-sql", "_id": "53d97638b9363c15b13bfc45", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2293802, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "DYNAMODB SQL", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
