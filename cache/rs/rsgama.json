In special, rsgama handle the data link layer. Currently, rsgama handle rs232 interface. However the main idea is create many instances for handle a lot of different interfaces. \r\n\tThis project was born because of the challenge made by the Professor Fernando in the University of Brasilia \u2013 Campus Gama. The professor gave the project of create the data link layer in a few time, and the student Charles and Rodrigo accepted the challenger. Both students work together with the object of create the specification of the data link protocol. Additionally they applied many principles of software engineering, like: analyses of requirements, code in pair, test code, techniques for keep the code clean, comment code with Doxygen, and so forth.\r\n\tIn the case that you are interested in the project, you can check the specification in the Doxygen file or in the file of description of the project.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rsgama", "_id": "50ff404724b0d936ca603ae5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1251386, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking", "shortname": "networking", "fullname": "Networking", "id": 150}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: Brazilian Portuguese", "shortname": "portuguesebrazilian", "fullname": "Brazilian Portuguese", "id": 381}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
