JSeisLab is a Java port of its predecessor \"Spectrum Division for Windows\" which is written in VB 6.0.\r\n\r\nRelated open source projects:\r\nJava API for GPIB devices. Does not support ethernet devices as of this writing (10. Feb. 2013.)\r\niC: As above.\r\nEPICs / javaIOC: Very complex. Uses XML for instrument drivers. Uses remotetea.\r\nremotetea: Uses VXI which needs installation of a VXI host for some instruments. It is still a good contender for someone who wants to use Java to control instruments.\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\nI created a JNA wrapper around Tektronik's Visa32.dll (JnaVisa32.jar) and tkVISA64.dll (JnaVisa64.jar) version 4.0 using JNAerator code.google.com/p/jnaerator).
