Currently the framework is just a set of modules that must be executed through complex command line parameters. But with JVolatility viewing data produced by volatility will just be a matter of clicking tabs and right clicking on listings of interest. Much more user friendly and, as a result, much less time wasted manipulating the framework and more time being productive.\r\n\r\nCurrently this project is in a \"work in progress\" stage so there are no zipped files for download.
