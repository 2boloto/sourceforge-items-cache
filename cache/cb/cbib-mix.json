The proposed algorithm builds an extension graph where vertices represent extremities of contigs and edges represent existing alignments between these extremities. These alignment edges are used for contig extension. The resulting output assembly corresponds to a path in the extension graph that maximizes the cumulative contig length. \r\n\r\nPlease note that Mix has moved to: https://github.com/massyah/MIX", "summary": "Mix is a tool to combine multiple assemblies from NGS data.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 799362, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cbib-mix", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/fmau/", "username": "fmau", "name": "Florence Maurier"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/cbib/", "username": "cbib", "name": "cbib"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cbib-mix/screenshot/mix_rodhobacter.png", "caption": "Subset of the graph obtained by working on the GAGE Rodhobacter data.
