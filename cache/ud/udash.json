I found lots of similar software, all are too difficult to use.\r\nThis one is the easier to use to my point of view, it concentrate on essentials, Project tasks and profile (each profile can contain one or more user).\r\nThis is the first version of the software, please leave me some reviews to help me improve it.\r\nI however admit that it's not the most beautifull, but it's clear and simple. Maybe, if this dashboard is enough downloaded, i will improve it...\r\nJust ask me, LDAP support for example, or AJAX work...", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "udash", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/y0ni/", "username": "y0ni", "name": "LAMRI Yoni"}], "external_homepage": ""}
