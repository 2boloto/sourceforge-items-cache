I have tried updating for Python3, however pygame does not appear to be compatible just yet.  \r\n\r\nThis game is similar to Missile Command however it adds an extra dimension of variability.  \r\n\r\nThe name of this program came about when I tried to do a trick-shot with my keyboard.  I was typing in \"island\", spun around after the 'a', and hit between the 'k' and 'i' keys, resulting in the word \"islaki\".  I just never bothered to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe run.sh file is really just included as a courtesy to the user.  If the command `python2` doesn't work on your operating system, you may have to change it to the appropriate command.\r\n\r\nDownload the tar.gz file to get the full game, or you can download the files in the 'program' directory one-by-one.", "shortname": "islakidefender", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Missile Command-type game for Linux using Pygame", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2344075}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/islakidefender/", "video_url": null}
