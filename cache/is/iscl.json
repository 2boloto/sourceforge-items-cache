Moreover some of the classes relatively recently has been adapted under Linux too, greatly easing writing for an example console applications or CGI scripts, giving among other things the rich possibilities of manipulation with character strings. And under Windows library also covers almost all of the graphics features of the operating system, including the implementation of all standard and additional controls on-screen forms and adding some missing elements of their own.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "iscl", "_id": "511ccf453e5e836dada4e797", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1280775, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Common Use C++ Classes", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
