The IWD algorithm is a population & nature-inspired combinatorial optimization algorithm. It tries to imitate the behavior that natural water drops conduct in river beds where they create complex paths that seem optimistic considering the environment, obstacles, and the surrounding terrain. \r\nOne way to use the IWD algorithm is to map our optimization problem into a graph over which Intelligent Water Drops (IWDs) travel from node to node to gradually create complete solutions. During this trip, the soli of the graph deposited on the links of the graph are changed and little by little the optimal paths will hold less soil in comparison to other possible paths.\r\nIt is also possible to solve continuous optimization problems by the IWD algorithm. One attempt is the IWD-CO (IWD for Continuous Optimization) \r\nIn this project, the focus is to gradually present implemented IWD-based algorithms.", "shortname": "iwda", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/hamed.shahhosseini.dr", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Solving optimization problems by the Intelligent Water Drops algorithm", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 706300}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/iwda/", "video_url": ""}
