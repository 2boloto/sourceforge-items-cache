It is intended to be installed on a USB flash drive to boot a computer for the purposes of virus removal, hard drive operations, and Windows password reset. Key programs included in the ISO are: AVG Free for Linux, ClamTK, Comodo Antivirus, Disk Utility, GParted, Boot Repair, Grub Customizer, CHNTPW, System Profiler And Benchmark, and Back In Time. As the ISO is simply a customized Lubuntu install, it is lightweight while still having the full functionality of Linux.\r\n\r\nWhile all of the software included in this ISO is free as in beer, not all of it is free as in speech. Some of the applications included are not open source and would reserve all rights. Since there is very little original code in this ISO, the licenses would be retained by the original creators. The license applied to this ISO only applies to the arrangement and customization of the applications and files, and not to the actual content.", "shortname": "zendorescue", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Lubuntu based ISO for antivirus, hdd issues, and password reset.", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1952290}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/zendorescue/", "video_url": ""}
