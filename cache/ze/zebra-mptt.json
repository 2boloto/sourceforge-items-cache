Also, Zebra_MPTT uses a caching mechanism which has as result the fact that regardless of the type, or the number of retrieval operations, the database is read only once per script execution.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "zebra-mptt", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/stefangabos/", "username": "stefangabos", "name": "stefangabos"}], "external_homepage": "http://stefangabos.ro/php-libraries/zebra-mptt/"}
