By choosing an appropriate style, the panel divisions can be made to coincide with the glazing bars.  This minimizes the visual impact of the panels from inside while making them virtually invisible from the outside.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "glassshutters", "_id": "526387f690954711585e68bd", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1984145, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Secondary glazing for sash windows", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mechanical and Civil Engineering :: Computer-aided technologies (CADD/CAM/CAE)", "shortname": "caddcam", "fullname": "Computer-aided technologies (CADD/CAM/CAE)", "id": 732}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Formats and Protocols :: Data Formats :: AutoCAD DXF", "shortname": "autocaddxf", "fullname": "AutoCAD DXF", "id": 746}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
