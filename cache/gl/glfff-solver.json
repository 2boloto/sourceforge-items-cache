The global potential field and the LFFF are dealt with in an unified way by solving a three-dimensional Helmholtz equation in spherical shell and a two-dimensional\r\nPoisson equation on the photosphere. The solver is based on a combination of the\r\nspectral method and the finite-difference scheme. In longitude direction the equation\r\nis transformed into Fourier spectral space and the resulted 2D equations in r\u2013\u03b8 plane\r\nfor the Fourier coefficients are solved by finite difference in a direct way. The solver\r\nshows a distinguish virtue of extremely fast computing speed, e.g., the computation for\r\na magnetogram with resolution of 180(\u03b8) \u00d7 360(\u03c6) is completed by only less than two\r\nseconds and even on a very high resolution 600 \u00d7 1200, the solution can be obtained\r\nwithin about one minute on a single 2.66G CPU.
