This means that no more hardcoded IPs, UserIDs and Passwords spread over 10s of hundreds of bash/python scripts.\r\n\r\nScripts written for one environment can be easily ported to another because the configuration is done outside of each workflow.\r\n\r\nHow is this done?\r\n\r\nEach Module has a configuration section in the /opt/glue/conf/workflow_modules.grooy where data like hosts, ips, usernames etc are placed. This configuration is loaded and provided to the Module before starting each workflow.\r\n\r\nConfigurations can be changed dynamically and are re-read before each workflow run, such that no restart is required.\r\n", "shortname": "glueworkflows", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "BigData Workflow Engine for Hadoop, Hbase, Netezza, Pig, Hive ...", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1890868}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/glueworkflows/", "video_url": ""}
