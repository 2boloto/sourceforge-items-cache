Building on previous work, this model is spatial and individual-based, using various geographical and demographic data sources to place households at absolute locations, populated with individuals of specific ages who each attend schools or workplaces situated in their vicinity. The significant advance of this project over previous work is the global nature of simulation, the memory and performance requirements of which motivate us towards a multi-core, multi-computer solution.
