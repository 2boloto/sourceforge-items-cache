We use a natural measure to estimate the similarity of the input sequences, and based on this measure, we align the input sequences differently. To test the effectiveness of this approach, we have implemented a multiple sequence alignment tool called GLProbs and compared its performance with a dozen leading alignment tools on three benchmark alignment databases, and GLProbs\u2019s alignments has the best scores in almost all testings. We have also evaluated the practicability of the alignments of GLProbs by applying the tool to three biological applications, namely phylogenetic trees construction, protein secondary structure prediction and the detection of high risk members for cervical cancer in the HPV-E6 family, and the results are very encouraging.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "glprobs", "_id": "5170c01c04161f79eb32b7a7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1613205, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "GLProbs: Aligning multiple sequences adaptively", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
