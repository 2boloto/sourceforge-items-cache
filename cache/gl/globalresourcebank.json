GRB converts the dollar account of everyone's assets to ecocredit. The GRB reserve provides shareholder accounts e40 a day for twenty years. Seven hundred trillions are invested in ecosystems and 500 trillions in communications. The GRB income account receives ecocredit from an ecosystem impact charge on shareholder and commercial accounts, and exchanges ecocredit with the GRB reserve to maintain equilibrium. Five percent of GRB income sustains communications and e40 a day goes to fully funded shareholder accounts, the remainder goes to the reserve. Shareholders invest 10 percent of their GRB income in ecosystems. Earth's current wealth of natural resources and GRB income distribution adjusts to shareholders feedback. After 1 year of inactivity accounts revert to the reserve. Manager chosen by majority.
