He now suffers from locked in syndrome, which means his only way of communicating is via blinking. Family members say the alphabet and he blinks on every letter to spell the word.\r\n\r\nI would like to see if it is possible to use either a smart phone or camera to control predictive text, eg. as a start up scheme I would like to have 5 topics. When the camera is activated the topics are relayed back through a speaker, then chosen via another blink. In each topic there would be a given number of saved phrases which could be chosen via another blink. I have no knowledge of how to start this project, if anybody feels as I do that this project to be life changing for the individual, please get in touch. Any thoughts or help would be extremely helpfull.", "shortname": "blinkcommunicat", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Blink actived communication system via camera.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1882717}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blinkcommunicat/", "video_url": ""}
