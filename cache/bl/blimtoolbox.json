The toolbox provides an implementation of the BarLine Intensity Mapper (BLIM) algorithm, which extracts high-intensity bands from Argus images. Also, several analysis and export functions are included in this toolbox, such as timestack plots and movies. The main incentive for the development of this toolbox was reducing the amount of time and effort a user spends on image analysis. This is achieved by a user-friendly graphical interface, functionality for browsing through images and results, flexible import and export functions, and the possibility to add user interface components and additional implementations of algorithms. Because BLIM Toolbox is meant to work with other Argus software, it is programmed in Matlab. For the BLIM Toolbox to run, Matlab needs to be installed. However, knowledge of Matlab programming is not required for using the toolbox.", "summary": "A set of tools for processing Argus images of the nearshore zone.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 652593, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "blimtoolbox", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/leopape/", "username": "leopape", "name": "Leo Pape"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blimtoolbox/screenshot/blimtool1.png", "caption": "BLIMToolbox: track breaker lines.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blimtoolbox/screenshot/blimtool1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blimtoolbox/screenshot/blimtool2.png", "caption": "BLIMToolbox: review tracked barline timestacks.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blimtoolbox/screenshot/blimtool2.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blimtoolbox/screenshot/blimtool3.png", "caption": "BLIMToolbox: review average timeseries.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blimtoolbox/screenshot/blimtool3.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a user interface (UI) system", "fullname": "Project is a user interface (UI) system", "shortname": "ui_meta_system", "id": 463}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "fullname": "MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "id": 626}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "fullname": "BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 187}], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
