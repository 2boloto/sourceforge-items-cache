As you can see in my GPE documentation, I no longer use the friend keyword quite so liberally (In fact, haven't used it once in GPE). The naming convention I have used is a bit wonky as well. In addition the scoping for all the variables, methods, etc. really needs to be reorganized.  I might get around to doing a refactoring on this code, but I wouldn't hold my breath.  I wrote it over three years ago, and wrote it in quite a hurry when I did.  If you compare this stuff with my GPE code, its like night and day.\r\n\r\nWell, hopefully somebody learning to work with OGRE or to program in C++, might find it useful", "summary": "Body Language Effect on Users", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 507437, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bleu", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gi27/", "username": "gi27", "name": "GERARD I Prudhomme"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://igerard.com", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 7 - Inactive", "fullname": "7 - Inactive", "shortname": "inactive", "id": 358}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Ogre3D", "fullname": "Ogre3D", "shortname": "ogre3d", "id": 808}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "fullname": "MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "id": 188}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Library :: Research", "fullname": "Research", "shortname": "research", "id": 819}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}]}}
