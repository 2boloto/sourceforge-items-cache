As you can see in my GPE documentation, I no longer use the friend keyword quite so liberally (In fact, haven't used it once in GPE). The naming convention I have used is a bit wonky as well. In addition the scoping for all the variables, methods, etc. really needs to be reorganized.  I might get around to doing a refactoring on this code, but I wouldn't hold my breath.  I wrote it over three years ago, and wrote it in quite a hurry when I did.  If you compare this stuff with my GPE code, its like night and day.\r\n\r\nWell, hopefully somebody learning to work with OGRE or to program in C++, might find it useful", "shortname": "bleu", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Body Language Effect on Users", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 507437}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bleu/", "video_url": null}
