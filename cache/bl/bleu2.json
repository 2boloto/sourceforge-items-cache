As you can see in my GPE documentation, I no longer use the friend keyword quite so liberally (In fact, haven't used it once in GPE). The naming convention I have used is a bit wonky as well. In addition the scoping for all the variables, methods, etc. really needs to be reorganized. I might get around to doing a refactoring on this code, but I wouldn't hold my breath. I wrote it over three years ago, and wrote it in quite a hurry when I did. If you compare this stuff with my GPE code, its like night and day.\r\n\r\nWell, hopefully somebody learning to work with OGRE or to program in C++, might find it useful", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bleu2", "_id": "516572ef2718467b61420e76", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 380838, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "id": 80}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics :: 3D Rendering", "shortname": "3drendering", "fullname": "3D Rendering", "id": 110}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Ogre3D", "shortname": "ogre3d", "fullname": "Ogre3D", "id": 808}], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
