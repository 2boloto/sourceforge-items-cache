Similarly, our imagination is the set of all possible things we can draw onto our most dense layer of visual cortex in electricity patterns. Bigger layers have more neurons to handle those possibilities. A Black Hole Cortex is a kind of visual cortex that has density of neuron layers similar to density at various radius from a black hole. What we think our eyes see, the imagination, is the densest and smallest layer. SphereSurfaces outside it recursively have more neurons, more surface area, but less density since it has to eventually dimension-reduce to high level ideas, like there are 10000 Wikipedia page names that cover most parts of the world. We can think of Wikipedia as a layer above our brains, a global SphereSurface of large surface area (a cortex layered on billions of minds) and small (10000 most important pages) density.", "summary": "Sphere surface layers of visual cortex approach maximum info density", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1074034, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "blackholecortex", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/benrayfield/", "username": "benrayfield", "name": "BenRayfield"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blackholecortex/screenshot/BlackHoleCortex%200.1.0.jpg", "caption": "version 0.1.0 is just getting the display and movement working.
