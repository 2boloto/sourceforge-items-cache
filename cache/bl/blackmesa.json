Some additional apps are added for improved functionality - Sony Media Apps (Album & Video), Walkman Music Player with ClearBass, Jelly Bean 4.2 Keyboard, Aptoide, F-Droid, PDroid Manager, beem, OpenSatNav and also a new bootanimation has sported instead of the default CyanogenMod. Gapps won't be included in my ROMs due to their proprietary nature and tracking capabilities. I strongly suggest to use free alternatives wherever possible and I have included some of them. \r\n\r\nYou are completely free to use my ROM as you wish, study, make modifications and redistribute your copies provided they carry the same freedom to others.", "shortname": "blackmesa", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Custom ROM for Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini (ST15i/Smultron)", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1253531}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blackmesa/", "video_url": ""}
