Both players are stuck in a building as a result of some kind of disaster or accident; the observer trapped inside and unable to leave on his own and the rover rendered blind yet able to move freely. The Observer must guide the rover through the building relying on blueprints of the building's floor plan using only coded vibrations sent through the game controller which Rover uses to move, and through the use of audible lures which rover can hear. Rover, in turn, can hear his surroundings which include various environmental hazards - live electrical wires, small fires, crumbling floors, etc... - and so is free to ignore the cues he receives from the Observer. The Observer must trust that Rover has a reason to ignore his cues, while Rover must trust that the Observer is trying to lead him to safety.", "shortname": "blindmansbluff", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A cooperative game of trust and communication", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2083895}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blindmansbluff/", "video_url": ""}
