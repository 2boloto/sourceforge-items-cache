It gives the ability to feed data from Bloomberg Data Server. Currently the bridge may handle Market Data and Refernce Data requests. The bridge can also be used in conjunction with the Avis open bridge to reuse single Bloomberg server connection and dispatch the incoming data to multiple OpenMAMA clients. Bloomberg API simulator for testing purposes has been developed and is provided. The simulator is a replacement of Bloomberg implementation that generates limited set of fields with random update frequency and values.", "summary": "Bloomberg subscriber bridge implementation for OpenMAMA middleware", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 890338, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "blpbridge", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ppatarinski-dev/", "username": "ppatarinski-dev", "name": "Pavel Patarinski"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blpbridge/screenshot/mamalistenc1.png", "caption": "scrshot1", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blpbridge/screenshot/mamalistenc1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blpbridge/screenshot/mamalistenc2.png", "caption": "scrshot2", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blpbridge/screenshot/mamalistenc2.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
