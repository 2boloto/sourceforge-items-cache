Blockyard is not gonna be the name when the game is released, its already taken, and only a project name. Now something about the gameplay.\r\nEverybody can do something in it, You can play with magic, Make potions and poisions. Make huge factories. You think that this is all nice but, things change your world, using magic, releases some bad magic in the lands, and that will corrupt it. Your factories will have trash, and you need to dump it somewhere, Potions can explode and give you strange side effects. So what you know now is: You can use things, but some things will make your world horrible, but, sometimes you need to do bad things, like if you wanna make a special potion, you need to get some land corrupt you may think, well how do i get all this stuff, The older culture has left artifacts, research them and you may find clues for machines, magic and potions.
