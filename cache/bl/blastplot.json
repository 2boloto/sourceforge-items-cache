Read-based BLAST analysis of NGS data is a common procedure especially in the case of metagenomic samples. However, coverage is usually not enough to allow for de novo assembly. This type of read-based analysis often creates the question of how a set of reads that align to the same sequence is distributed. The same question applies to preparation of primers or probes for microarray experiments.\r\nWe have created BLASTPLOT, a PERL module to quickly plot the BLAST results from short sequences (primers, probes, reads) against reference targets. \r\nBLASTPLOT is a simple to use PERL module that allows the generation of PNG graphs for all the reference sequences associated with a BLAST result set.\r\nBLASTPLOT has only two PERL package dependencies: Math::Round and GD.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "blastplot", "_id": "52406a59b9363c11089c9ad2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1960374, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A simple and easy to use  perl package to plot blast output results", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
