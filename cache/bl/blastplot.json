Read-based BLAST analysis of NGS data is a common procedure especially in the case of metagenomic samples. However, coverage is usually not enough to allow for de novo assembly. This type of read-based analysis often creates the question of how a set of reads that align to the same sequence is distributed. The same question applies to preparation of primers or probes for microarray experiments.\r\nWe have created BLASTPLOT, a PERL module to quickly plot the BLAST results from short sequences (primers, probes, reads) against reference targets. \r\nBLASTPLOT is a simple to use PERL module that allows the generation of PNG graphs for all the reference sequences associated with a BLAST result set.\r\nBLASTPLOT has only two PERL package dependencies: Math::Round and GD.\r\n", "shortname": "blastplot", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A simple and easy to use  perl package to plot blast output results", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1960374}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/blastplot/", "video_url": ""}
