Yet it can be very challenging too. I heard there are people spending days to fit 7 blocks to a small puzzle.\r\n\r\nI write this simple application to find the puzzle solution. Surely the fun of the game is to find the solution by your own. But I hope this small application can help you when you are frustrated and eager to know the solution.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, you can see the solution step by step and save the puzzle.\r\n\r\nYou need .Net Framework 3.5 and above to run the application.
