But the lack of advanced functionalities already implemented forces us to use tier libraries like Smart-GWT, Vaadin, GXT and others. These libraries provide out of the box components to suit almost all your needs.\r\nDaikit4Gxt is a framework based on top of GXT, it aims to provide an abstraction permitting to build backoffice applications with a powerful client side MVC, highly extensible actions mechanism with progress bars and callbacks, multi-language handling, complex widgets like grid dual views, combobox with paging and dynamic reloading, editors for all sort of data types ... Everything you need to edit and display any kind of data model with lots of customization features... all in java!\r\nIt has been used in several projects for big companies and is open source with Apache 2.0 license.\r\nBut GXT (http://www.sencha.com/products/gxt) needs a license!", "shortname": "daikit4gxt", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Framework to build backoffice applications on top of GXT and GWT", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2053906}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/daikit4gxt/", "video_url": ""}
