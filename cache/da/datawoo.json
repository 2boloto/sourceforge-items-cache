DataWoo is meant to be a research and development platform that can be extended into just about any enterprise-level web application. The architecture will be developed in three phases:\r\n\r\n1. Basic Spring Architecture: Provides all the basic components needed to field an enterprise-level application. \r\n\r\n2. Programmatic Security Model: Incorporates the components needed to dynamically assign users to user roles and user roles to profiles.\r\n \r\n3. Meta-Driven Architecture: Use meta-data to dynamically configure 80%-90% of the application using the concepts exemplified in the Compiere open source project.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "datawoo", "_id": "50eb383b5fcbc9161b1e3e2c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 335452, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing", "shortname": "testing", "fullname": "Testing", "id": 575}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "id": 606}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Documentation", "shortname": "documentation", "fullname": "Documentation", "id": 564}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JSP", "shortname": "jsp", "fullname": "JSP", "id": 572}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache License V2.0", "shortname": "apache2", "fullname": "Apache License V2.0", "id": 401}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: JDBC", "shortname": "db_api_jdbc", "fullname": "JDBC", "id": 502}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "id": 866}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Management", "shortname": "management", "fullname": "Management", "id": 725}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
