DataWoo is meant to be a research and development platform that can be extended into just about any enterprise-level web application. The architecture will be developed in three phases:\r\n\r\n1. Basic Spring Architecture: Provides all the basic components needed to field an enterprise-level application. \r\n\r\n2. Programmatic Security Model: Incorporates the components needed to dynamically assign users to user roles and user roles to profiles.\r\n \r\n3. Meta-Driven Architecture: Use meta-data to dynamically configure 80%-90% of the application using the concepts exemplified in the Compiere open source project.", "shortname": "datawoo", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 335452}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/datawoo/", "video_url": ""}
