Complexation of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins is a prevailing and highly conserved mechanism of signal integration within critical regulatory pathways and enable to infer controlled genes as well as the exerted regulatory mechanism.\r\n\r\nWe developed DACO (domain-aware cohesiveness optimization), a novel algorithm that combines protein-protein interaction networks and domain-domain interaction networks with the cluster-quality metric cohesiveness. The metric is locally maximized on the holistic level of protein interactions while sophisticated connectivity constraints on the domain level are utilized to account for the exclusive and thus inherently combinatorial nature of the interactions within such assemblies.
