It's development started back in 2005. It was first thought to kill a set of windows process at once. With the time it became a GPL task manager replacement for Windows. You can kill a process by dragging the mouse over the windows, by right-clicking the process in the main process list, or by typing its name with the \"Kill all by name\" command. You can set a any window to be always on top, to be transparent, to be enable, et cetera. Although Daphne was born just to kill windows process. You can think of Daphne as a task manager replacement. The main window displays a list of currently running process with detailed information about: CPU usage, Process ID, Process name, Full path (and arguments), Priority, Class (Process / Service), Current memory usage, Peek memory usage, Current swap usage, Peek swap usage and Number of threads.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "daphne", "_id": "53b6ec149095473fba94e825", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2274829, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "GPL task manager replacement for Windows", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "id": 12}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Debuggers", "shortname": "debuggers", "fullname": "Debuggers", "id": 47}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "id": 253}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: French", "shortname": "french", "fullname": "French", "id": 276}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Polish", "shortname": "polish", "fullname": "Polish", "id": 344}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Italian", "shortname": "italian", "fullname": "Italian", "id": 337}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Greek", "shortname": "greek", "fullname": "Greek", "id": 332}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Swedish", "shortname": "swedish", "fullname": "Swedish", "id": 348}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Brazilian Portuguese", "shortname": "portuguesebrazilian", "fullname": "Brazilian Portuguese", "id": 381}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Chinese (Simplified)", "shortname": "chinesesimplified", "fullname": "Chinese (Simplified)", "id": 382}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: German", "shortname": "german", "fullname": "German", "id": 279}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Japanese", "shortname": "japanese", "fullname": "Japanese", "id": 278}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Spanish", "shortname": "spanish", "fullname": "Spanish", "id": 277}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Russian", "shortname": "russian", "fullname": "Russian", "id": 295}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Arabic", "shortname": "arabic", "fullname": "Arabic", "id": 326}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "id": 906}]}}
