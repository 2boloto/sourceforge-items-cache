It's development started back in 2005. It was first thought to kill a set of windows process at once. With the time it became a GPL task manager replacement for Windows. You can kill a process by dragging the mouse over the windows, by right-clicking the process in the main process list, or by typing its name with the \"Kill all by name\" command. You can set a any window to be always on top, to be transparent, to be enable, et cetera. Although Daphne was born just to kill windows process. You can think of Daphne as a task manager replacement. The main window displays a list of currently running process with detailed information about: CPU usage, Process ID, Process name, Full path (and arguments), Priority, Class (Process / Service), Current memory usage, Peek memory usage, Current swap usage, Peek swap usage and Number of threads.", "shortname": "daphne", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "GPL task manager replacement for Windows", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2274829}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/daphne/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/8Y1jZ23Y6sA?rel=0"}
