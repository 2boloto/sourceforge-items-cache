The system was originally designed for processing financial data with the general goal to be able to monitor up to 20 different securities as their values were changing during a trading session. The sonifications were designed to make it easy to distinguish between different securities, and to convey as much information about each security\u2019s activity using the shortest possible sound duration. The software platform was designed using multiple threads with a gatekeeper function to manage simultaneous sonifications events without confusion or system failure. The release of this software together with its financial data stream implementation to the open source community is hoped to be of use to researchers interested in sonifying real-time data streams.", "shortname": "datasonification", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Musical Sonification of Real-Time Data Streams", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2093573}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/datasonification/", "video_url": ""}
