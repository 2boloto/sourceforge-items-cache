But Darkside is not mentioned to be a copy of these games in any sence. I just think that nowadays games are boring (each new title is simplified) despite a nice graphics and effects. I enjoyed those old games for hundreds of hours - and that's all I want, create a game which will be fun to play with a lot of options for its players.\r\n\r\nPlease note that screenshots are from Java Swing based build (now 4 years old), right now I'm working on rewriting it to Java FX and I'm also making big code changes.
