The HFC-S PCI A based cards are very cheap and thus ideal for private BRI users.\r\n\r\nThe OSLEC is being developed since a long time ago and said to be very good. The superiority of \"hardware echo cancellers\" is a myth. This makes the fact that HFC-S does not have a hardware echo canceller an advantage if you decide to better use free software and maybe even improve the echo canceller.\r\n\r\nThe dahdi-hfcs is the latest Digium DAHDI kernel module svn trunk plus adopted and properly renamed zaphfc driver plus latest OSLEC echo canceller svn trunk, all ready to compile out-of-the-box.
