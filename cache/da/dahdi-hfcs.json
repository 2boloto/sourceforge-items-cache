DAHDI driven hardware can be used by Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, Yate and other telephony software. The HFC-S PCI A based cards are very cheap and thus ideal for private BRI users.\r\n\r\nThe OSLEC is being developed since a long time ago and said to be very good. The superiority of \"hardware echo cancellers\" is a myth. This makes the fact that HFC-S does not have a hardware echo canceller an advantage if you decide to better use free software and maybe even improve the echo canceller.\r\n\r\nThe dahdi-hfcs is the latest Digium DAHDI kernel module svn trunk plus adopted and properly renamed zaphfc driver plus latest OSLEC echo canceller svn trunk, all ready to compile out-of-the-box. By default only the things you need to drive a HFC-S PCI A based ISDN BRI card plus some software drivers like dummy device and echo canceller", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dahdi-hfcs", "_id": "519e65522718464efa449c18", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 617761, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "(Latest DAHDI + HFC-S PCI A support + latest OSLEC) in one git.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: Telephony", "shortname": "telephony", "fullname": "Telephony", "id": 247}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "id": 16}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Telecommunications Industry", "shortname": "telecommunications", "fullname": "Telecommunications Industry", "id": 368}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
