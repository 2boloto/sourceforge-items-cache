It has the basic functions that can be used as a base foundation to build features to run any size facility. In it you will find attendance tracking, and pickup functions. \r\nWe are planning more features as the project grows. The newest feature of the SaaS version of the program will include a messaging system that displays a reminder message to a parent or a global message to all parents. Also, there will be a way to post a balance to the parents. These are the two most requested features that are being added.\r\nWe see this package going a long way with the number of downloads that are being recorded. Thanks!\r\n\r\nWe are beginning work on version 1.2 of the product.
