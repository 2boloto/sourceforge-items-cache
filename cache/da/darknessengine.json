If you do not know what text adventures are, they are a type of games where is player does not see anything but text. Everything is described to him in text. Old games used to do this, but currently there are few text-based games. That is where Darkness Engine comes. This engine, developed in C++ by Gnm Software 2012, was created for this specific purpose, and almost every single line of the source code is commented to explain it. This is multi-platform, but we recommend you to replace some Windows-only code (those lines are commented) with their equivalents on other OSes.
