I hope to check this model with the Quantum Mechanical model as well as with experimenters to see if we can get more precision then the known Quantum Mechanics, which means a better understanding of our reality, space-time and I hope Dark Matter, I think that the \"Calabi-Yau's and Dark Matter\" might be the same thing ...   and they are closely guarded dynamic engines of space and particles...\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "darkmattercalab", "_id": "5123168b1be1ce224eeb7cfd", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1286300, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "cool simulation of dark matter hiding inside space and a electron", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
