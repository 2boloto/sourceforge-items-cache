The main text in docx files is found in document.xml file in the collection. Corrupt DOCX Salvager uses 7Zip, an unzipper that sometimes unzips partially corrupt document.xml files  despite reporting an error.  \r\n\r\nXML as a format is unforgiving of data corruption but Corrupt DOCX Salvager uses a Perl routine used to extract the text from the document.xml file which doesn't care about well-formed XML, a recovery stumbling block for Microsoft Word.\r\n\r\nRecent changes include the pretreatment of docx files with InfoZip's zip.exe -FF repair command, improving success rates. Also added are links to other solutions.\r\n\r\nIf you are unsatisfied with the results, try my other corrupt Word recovery capable programs here on Sourceforge, S2 Recovery Tools for Word and Savvy DOCX Recovery.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "damageddocx2txt", "_id": "5055241071b75b3c59967d17", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 258068, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "donate", "name": "link", "label": "Donate"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Extract text from corrupt DOCX files where Word itself fails.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Text Editors :: Word Processors", "shortname": "wordprocessors", "fullname": "Word Processors", "id": 70}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Office Suites", "shortname": "suites", "fullname": "Office Suites", "id": 131}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Data recovery", "shortname": "recovery", "fullname": "Data recovery", "id": 787}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Perl", "shortname": "perl", "fullname": "Perl", "id": 176}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Tcl", "shortname": "tcl", "fullname": "Tcl", "id": 182}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Non-Profit Organizations", "shortname": "nonprofit", "fullname": "Non-Profit Organizations", "id": 618}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Religion", "shortname": "religion", "fullname": "Religion", "id": 366}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
