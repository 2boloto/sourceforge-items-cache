So, I'm pretty thankful to them.\r\n\r\nI've tried my best to make the code cleaner and readable by adding the comments. Being a newbie developer, there is a lot, yes a lot, to improve in this script. This script is nowhere perfect.\r\n\r\nDamn Simple Classifieds is a very small, open-source project that allows you to set up your classifieds script in few clicks and with very little coding skills. It's quite simple. This project was created by Areeb (that's me!).\r\n\r\nI started working on this project on 24th October 2014 and finally completed it by 27th October 2014.\r\n\r\nThis SF page will be updated when we release a major installation. If you want to update your installation for even minor updates, please use the link below.\r\n\r\nFor more information and if you want to contribute, look here: https://github.com/areebmajeed/Damn-Simple-Classifieds", "shortname": "damn-simple-classifieds", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "hackingtag", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "It's a simple script which allows you to create your own listings.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2352746}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/damn-simple-classifieds/", "video_url": null}
