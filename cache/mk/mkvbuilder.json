The target format will be an MKV container and the underlying media files will be x264 for the video content and audio source will remain untouched. This application will be instantiated by a user inserting a DVD or Bluray into their drive. The process will continue without prompting the user until complete. An audio chime  notifies the user upon completion.\r\nBeyond ripping and transcoding the DVD/BD into the target formats mkvbuilder will automatically identify the DVD/BD and collect meta-data and artwork to include in the MKV container.\r\n\r\nCurrently this runs as a Upstart service in Ubuntu. No gui is ready for it at present. \r\n\r\nPrerequisites are MakeMKV, dvdid(details to follow) and a custom x264 binary build (included).
