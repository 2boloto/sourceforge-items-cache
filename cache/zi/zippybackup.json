ZippyBackup focuses on providing simple file backup in an open, common file format instead of a proprietary format that locks you into a particular backup software. Full and incremental backups are automatically provided. ZippyBackup also supports 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) security for your zip files (note: depends on OS support). With both compression and encryption, this combination makes ZippyBackup an ideal tool for storing backups offsite on systems such as DropBox or Google Drive.\r\n\r\nZippyBackup also provides a restoration panel where you can view and retrieve your previous backups. The tool lets you view or extract your files and folders as they were when the backup was made, regardless of the complex combination of full and incremental backups holding your data behind the scenes.
