ZipBackup focuses on providing simple file backup in an open, common file format instead of a proprietary format that locks you into a particular backup software. Full and incremental backups are automatically provided. ZipBackup also supports 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) security for your zip files - the same security used by the NSA for classified information. With both compression and encryption, this combination makes ZipBackup an ideal tool for storing backups offsite on systems such as DropBox or Google Drive.\r\n\r\nZipBackup also provides a restoration panel where you can view and retrieve your previous backups. The tool lets you view or extract your files and folders as they were when the backup was made, regardless of the complex combination of full and incremental backups holding your data behind the scenes.
