Processors embed model detail into runtime algorithms, minimizing rediscovery operations. Spatial algebra organizes and simplifies recursive algorithms. Gaussian Elimination with Complete Pivoting converts constraint Jacobian matrices and equations into Row-Reduced Echelon Form and partitions variables into Dependent/Independent sets. The constrained equations of motion are effectively converted from DAE to ODE form, allowing simple robust sparse factor and solve algorithms. Processors enhance and maintain most aspects of runtime algorithm performance, insuring continuous robust and efficient solutions. ANSI-C is the proposed programming language. Project administrator and programmers are needed. I will provide theoretical background, technical detail, and training once I learn how to use this website.", "shortname": "perdyn", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Processor Enhanced Robust Core Solver for Recursive Multibody Dynamics", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 847218}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/perdyn/", "video_url": ""}
