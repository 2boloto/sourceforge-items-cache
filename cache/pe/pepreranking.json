Improving peptide identification results by ranking true Peptide-Spectrum Matches (PSMs) over their false counterparts leads to the development of various re-ranking algorithms. In peptide re-ranking, discriminative information is essential to distinguish true PSMs from false PSMs. Generally, most peptide re-ranking methods obtain discriminative information directly from database search scores or by training machine learning models. Information in the protein database and MS1 spectra (i.e. single stage MS spectra) is ignored. We propose to use these information to improve peptide re-ranking results.", "shortname": "pepreranking", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Peptide re-ranking with protein-peptide correspondence and precursor p", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 662126}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pepreranking/", "video_url": ""}
