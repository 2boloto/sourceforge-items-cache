Very quick and stable so it can handle our recording studios most demanding work yet loaded with the best selection of open source software available today. The system is ready to go out of the box for many of us power users. The software chosen and added to this release should earn the \"bloated\" (too much software) slang however with only a few minor tweaks this system does run as fast or faster than any other release.\r\n\r\nThere are two different ISO's available and both are 64 bit the MATE desktop but both include the newly updated Kodi Media Center (Pearl Media Center) with used to be called XBMC. Full 1080 HD content streams all video feeds flawlessly. Lots of free TV links and options available. Look under the Fusion source repository already installed for best content.\r\n\r\nSee README for more info on the two versions of this release with a complete software list.", "shortname": "pearlmate20", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "scottyvbama", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A stable feature packed Multimedia Linux Distro that you heard about", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2472533}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pearlmate20/", "video_url": null}
