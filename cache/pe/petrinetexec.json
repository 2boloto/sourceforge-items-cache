That is not really a feature :-) but to those of you able to cope with this news I suggest to read further;\r\n* Petri Nets are created with PetriNetExec by writing Java code and using the provided API;\r\n* PetriNetExec provides a simple yet powerful callback mechanism allowing you to actually do something when events are fired and the network status is changing. \r\n* PetriNetExec is embeddable into your Java application. This means that you can build your own application and add Petri Nets into it. \r\n* PetriNetExec is open-source.", "shortname": "petrinetexec", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "PetriNetExec a library for embedding Petri Nets into Java applications", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 779029}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/petrinetexec/", "video_url": ""}
