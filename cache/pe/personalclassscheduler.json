Unless overridden by the user, this program provides usable schedules and avoids schedule conflicts and closed sections.  The user chooses the session (semester or quarter) and the courses, and blocks out any personal time needed for jobs, child care, sleeping, eating, etc.\r\n\r\nAccess to schools' schedules is via plugins that any Java programmer can write.  Some plugins are provided, including  one that can use comma separated values suitable for any college or university, and including one for demonstration purposes.\r\n\r\nPlugins can access a school's web-based schedule of classes, but require maintenance because the web pages change.  It is hoped that the open source nature of this software will lead to wider authoring and maintenance of plugins.\r\n\r\nSome users have commented that this program provides \"prettier\" printed schedules than their school's own web page can provide.", "shortname": "personalclassscheduler", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Provides schedules for college students.", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2425793}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/personalclassscheduler/", "video_url": null}
