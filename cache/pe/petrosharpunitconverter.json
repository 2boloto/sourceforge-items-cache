It includes two dynamic link libraries (DLL); which are properties of PetroSharp. The BigDecimal Library\u2122; which supports unlimited number of digits (with correct rounding) and the BigDecimal Unit Converter\u2122.\r\n\r\nThe need for higher-precision computations and the inconsistencies, found in converters available over the net, were the motives to the development of this converter. Very few converters support accuracies up to 8 digits. Still they are inconsistent, where answers deviate after the sixth digit.\r\n\r\nIt covers 35 categories such as acceleration, angle, angular velocity, area, dynamic viscosity, kinematic viscosity, and volume to count a few. Under each category, the number of units ranges from 4 to over 80 units.
