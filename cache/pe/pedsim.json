The PEDSIM library allows you to use pedestrian dynamics in your own software. Based on pure C++ without additional packages, it runs virtually on every operating system. The PEDSIM Demo Application gives you a quick overview of the capabilities, and is a starting point for your own experiments. \r\n\r\nPEDSIM is suitable for use in crowd simulations (e.g. indoor evacuation simulation, large scale outdoor simulations), where one is interested in output like pedestrian density or evacuation time. Also, the quality of the individual agent's trajectory is high enough for creating massive pedestrian crowds in movies. Since libpedsim is easy to use and extend, it is a good starting point for science projects.
