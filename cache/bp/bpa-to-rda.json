These large scale genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets are being generated and centrally managed by Bioplatforms Australia in collaboration with leading scientists, research institutes and government agencies. With the support of ANDS, QFAB has developed this web application to enable the publication of these datasets to Research Data Australia (RDA).
