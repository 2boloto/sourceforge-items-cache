This is useful if you're writing a small web-based app to run locally.\r\n\r\nSince JavaScript isn't allowed to read or write files, a PHP script takes care of all of the \"real\" work.  The JavaScript class simply sends requests to (and receives responses from) the PHP script.  Because it relies on this PHP script, you'll need to have a PHP web server running on the machine (LAMP or WAMP would work great).\r\n\r\nTo try out the sample, just copy everything into a folder on your local web server, and point your web browse to the sample.html file (likely at http://localhost/jsfileio/sample.html).\r\n\r\nCurrently, only text files are supported.  Binary file support may come in the future.\r\n\r\nThe initial code is just a quick hack I threw together, and there's not much to it yet, other than basic functionality which seems to work so far.
