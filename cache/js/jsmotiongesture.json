Your functions get called when the user makes the gesture with the device. \r\n\r\nThe library comes with some pre-recorded gestures.\r\nYou can also record your own custom gestures using the recorder application.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This library recognises gestures made by moving the hand-held device in your hand.
