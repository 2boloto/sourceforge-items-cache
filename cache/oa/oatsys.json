The teacher can then view the statistics about the absence of students and sort the odd ones out. The attendance can also be viewed by the parents who need to keep track of how their ward is going on with his classes. The system can be used in both elementary schools and colleges.", "shortname": "oatsys", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "takes attendance from teachers and shows attendance report", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 972884}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/oatsys/", "video_url": ""}
