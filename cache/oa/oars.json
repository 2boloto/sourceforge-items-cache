Specifically the Invensence MPU-6000 or newer. This chip is a highly accurate inertial measurement unit, or (IMU). Contained within this small IMU is a 3-axis Accelerometer, 3-axis Gyro, and 3-axis Magnetometer. Along with a built in processor, it can calculate movements along 9-axis. Depending on platform and app setting, OARS can record sensor values at a rate up to 100hz, or 100 positions per second. GPS data such as Longitude, Latitude, Direction, Speed, and Elevation, are also logged at approximately 1hz, or 1 update per second. Giving you the ability to precisely map an equipped objects location, orientation, and rate of movement along any plane with extreme accuracy.", "shortname": "oars", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "OARS - Orientational Awareness Reaction Systems", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2399207}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/oars/", "video_url": null}
