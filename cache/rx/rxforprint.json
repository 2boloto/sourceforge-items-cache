It can also be sent offsite for analysis by printer dealers, or other interested parties, to provide detailed reports on print activity and associated costs at a customer location.\r\n\r\nRXforPrint is an essential tool for organizations which want to keep track of print activity by users and by departments.  By using this tool you can quickly identify printing cost hot spots and wasteful users.  \r\nIt helps you to significantly reduce printing costs and to implement \"green initiatives\" by providing a verifiable proof of reduced print.", "shortname": "rxforprint", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "User-centric print monitoring tool for medium sized businesses", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1946194}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rxforprint/", "video_url": ""}
