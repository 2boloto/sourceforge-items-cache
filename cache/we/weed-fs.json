There are two objectives:\r\n\r\n1. to store billions of files!\r\n\r\n2. to serve the files fast!\r\n\r\nInstead of supporting full POSIX file system semantics, Weed-FS choose to implement only a key~file mapping. Similar to the word \"NoSQL\", you can call it as \"NoFS\".\r\n\r\nInstead of managing all file metadata in a central master, Weed-FS choose to manages file volumes in the central master, and let storage nodes manage files and the metadata. This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into storage nodes memories, allowing faster file access with just one disk read operation.\r\n\r\nWeed-FS models after Facebook's Haystack design paper.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found on http://weed-fs.googlecode.com", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "weed-fs", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/chrislusf2/", "username": "chrislusf2", "name": "Chris Lu"}], "external_homepage": "http://weed-fs.googlecode.com"}
