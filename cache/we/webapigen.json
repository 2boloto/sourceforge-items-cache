The idea is to provide a collection of functions for an AJAX (or AJA JSON) environment, although it can be used to emit straight html. The program takes a specification of an api and generates cgiMain() along with some helper functions.\r\n\r\nWhether it's worth messing about with a mini language to come up with a relatively simple program which most people would probably do in some scripting language is for you to decide. I enjoy concocting small languages and prefer c++ to such scripting languages (php, python, lua, javascript) as I have had passing contact with: if this is you, then you may like this effort.\r\n\r\nManual at http://www.njames.co.uk/reference/webApiGen.html", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "webapigen", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/nickj2000/", "username": "nickj2000", "name": "nickj2000"}], "external_homepage": ""}
