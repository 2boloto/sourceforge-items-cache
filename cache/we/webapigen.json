The idea is to provide a collection of functions for an AJAX (or AJA JSON) environment, although it can be used to emit straight html.

I enjoy concocting small languages and prefer c++ to such scripting languages (php, python, lua, javascript) as I have had passing contact with: if this is you, then you may like this effort.\r\n\r\nManual at http://www.njames.co.uk/reference/webApiGen.html", "shortname": "webapigen", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Windows console program providing a front end to the cgic library", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 850091}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/webapigen/", "video_url": ""}
