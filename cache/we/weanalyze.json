Analyze' with its own UI which analyzes connector logs manually or using an API that can be started from the command line, a schedule task or from the console with an action in rule, tool or integration command (if you use the API you can forward the events to a syslog listener in CEF format).", "shortname": "weanalyze", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "We!
