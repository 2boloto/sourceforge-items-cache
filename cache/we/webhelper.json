The whole point of this program is to minimize the amount of data you will need to upload to your website. However, with CSS3, a lot of important usage part need important prefixes like (IE: -ms-, Chrome/Safari:-webkit-, Firefox:-moz-, and Opera:-o-;-xv-). This is up-to-date as of 11/2/2012. Also remember, this program has certain syntax you must have, for example, if a line has any sort of comment in it, it will not be considered (and this could cause major issues if you had in-line comments), and all white space is removed, except the single space, preventing non-white space in plain text. Also, if your css3 command starts with \"@\", it will need to be all in one line. (example: @keyframes ___{} must all be on a single line.) However, it will increase support, and reduce the file size, so that when many people visit your website, you use less data and have more functionality for more people.", "shortname": "webhelper", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Reduces data usage for websites and increases browser support for CSS3", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1060709}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/webhelper/", "video_url": ""}
