Therefore we created Web-TCGA, a web based, freely accessible online tool, for integrated analysis of molecular cancer data sets, provided by the TCGA. In contrast to already available tools, Web-TCGA utilizes different methods and visualization techniques, allowing to create global molecular profiles across different cancer entities at the same time. In addition to global molecular profiles, Web-TCGA offers highly detailed gene and tumor entity centric analysis by providing interactive tables and views.\r\n", "shortname": "webtcga", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A light weight tool to access TCGA data", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2454114}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/webtcga/", "video_url": null}
