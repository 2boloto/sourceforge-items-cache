Although WPC is designed to be used primarily as a CMS website, there are some very unique ideas built into it. The development and design is centered at the core of the application in being \u201cglobally evolving\u201d, The design of WPC\u2019s core is designed to be limited only by the limitations of the database in as the maximum data that can be stored in a single table row column and since the values WPC\u2019s core uses to function are very small per column row making WPC almost limitless in the growth and complexity of its application core. Also the core is written and arranged is such a way that adding any new secondary applications and functions act in the same manner as current \u201cplug and play\u201d devices do on present computer systems operating systems.
