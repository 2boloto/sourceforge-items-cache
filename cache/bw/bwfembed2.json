Feel free to contribute or fork!\r\n\r\nMain purpose of this software is to provide a way of realtime audio file to SDI stream embedding using two DeckLink devices. It can be controlled using Sony 9-pin protocol or control a deck using the same interface. Other than that quicktime video capture and playback is supported.", "shortname": "bwfembed2", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Universal tool for BlackMagic DeckLink devices", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 730694}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwfembed2/", "video_url": ""}
