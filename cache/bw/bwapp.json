What makes bWAPP so unique? Well, it has over 100 web bugs! It covers all major known web vulnerabilities, including all risks from the OWASP Top 10 project. The focus is not just on one specific issue... bWAPP is covering a wide range of vulnerabilities!\r\n\r\nbWAPP is a PHP application that uses a MySQL database. It can be hosted on Linux/Windows with Apache/IIS and MySQL. It is supported on WAMP or XAMPP. Another possibility is to download bee-box, a custom VM pre-installed with bWAPP.\r\n\r\nThis project is part of the ITSEC GAMES project. You can find more about the ITSEC GAMES and bWAPP projects on our blog.\r\n\r\nFor security-testing and educational purposes only!\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nMalik Mesellem", "summary": "an extremely buggy web app !", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1217200, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "MME_IT", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://nl-nl.facebook.com/pages/MME-IT-Audits-Security/104153019664877", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bwapp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mmesellem/", "username": "mmesellem", "name": "Malik"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_01.png", "caption": "bWAPP portal", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_01.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_02.png", "caption": "SQL injection", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_02.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_03.png", "caption": "CAPTCHAs", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_03.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_04.png", "caption": "Web Services (SOAP)", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_04.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_05.png", "caption": "Heartbleed vulnerability", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_05.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_06.png", "caption": "ClickJacking", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bwapp/screenshot/bWAPP_06.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.itsecgames.com", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "fullname": "MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "id": 524}], "topic": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Auditors", "fullname": "Auditors", "shortname": "auditors", "id": 864}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "id": 866}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: FreeBSD", "fullname": "FreeBSD", "shortname": "freebsd", "id": 203}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "fullname": "OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Virtualization :: VMware", "fullname": "VMware", "shortname": "vmware", "id": 665}]}}
