The problems cover most of\r\nthe concepts of classical Functional Analysis: Distributions, Hilbert Spaces, Harmonic\r\nAnalysis, Spectral Theory... The 828 exercises provided in TPFA represent\r\nan incredibly rich source of problems in order to train oneself in these fields. These\r\nexercises also bring numerous original entry points for various subjects outside the\r\nfield of the theory developed in the core book. Finally, it is important to note that\r\nwhile the volumes are obviously naturally bundled with the core book, they have\r\nbeen written completely independently of it.\r\n\u000f We respect as far as possible the original notations and their conventions.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tpfa-answerbook", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ruppmartin/", "username": "ruppmartin", "name": "rupp"}], "external_homepage": "http://tpfa-answer-book.info"}
