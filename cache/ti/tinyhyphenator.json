Currently the only language supported is German, but it can very easily be adapted to support other languages. This library spans ~370 lines of C++ code.

This library is not based on any algorithm published on the internet or elsewhere and it works without a dictionary. The Library is written in C++ and is tested under GCC 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9\r\n\r\n[Use it in any way you want, including commercial work, but please include my name and a link to this page]", "shortname": "tinyhyphenator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "C++ Library to hyphenate a text", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2282389}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tinyhyphenator/", "video_url": null}
