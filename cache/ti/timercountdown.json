The numbers appear large enough to be seen at a distance, or the display can be shrunk into the corner of a presentation screen.  The time-remaining display changes color, as a warning, near end of the duration.  Display also shows elapsed time, and has a pause/resume button.  The application is a simple stand-alone executable that can be placed on any machine, and does not require internet connection to use it.  Can be used to count-down time for events lasting less than one minute, hours, days, or up to a year.
