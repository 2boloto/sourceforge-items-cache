It is designed to illustrate the relative dimensional properties predicted in a eight dimensional universe that is exponentially expanding. There are two sets of time-space dimensions; linear and curved. These dimensions multiply each other, as the universe expands in it's eight dimensions. \r\n\r\nAfter working with this program for awhile, I discovered that it only works with objects in separate galaxies sufficiently away from each other and the galaxy of the observer. This is due to galaxies orbital velocity law, a property not included in this program. Maybe at some point I'll create a better program with such variables.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "timedilation", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/timephantom/", "username": "timephantom", "name": "John C.
