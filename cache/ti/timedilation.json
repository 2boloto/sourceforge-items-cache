It is designed to illustrate the relative dimensional properties predicted in a eight dimensional universe that is exponentially expanding. There are two sets of time-space dimensions; linear and curved. These dimensions multiply each other, as the universe expands in it's eight dimensions. \r\n\r\nAfter working with this program for awhile, I discovered that it only works with objects in separate galaxies sufficiently away from each other and the galaxy of the observer. This is due to galaxies orbital velocity law, a property not included in this program. Maybe at some point I'll create a better program with such variables.", "shortname": "timedilation", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Time dilation equations for the First Flash cosmological model.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 698945}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/timedilation/", "video_url": ""}
