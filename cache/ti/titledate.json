It contains several databases created by the artist Walter van Rijn in collaboration with other artists, galleries, and collectors. Some data is gathered independently from online sources. \r\n\r\nThe metadata gathered is primarily artwork title, date and name. Depending on the gallery it might also contain exhibition metadata, such as exhibition dates, exhibition title, and the names of organisers and curators. Pictures of the works are not included.\r\n\r\nFor DOWNLOAD: go to FILES tab above.\r\n\r\nAims: 1) To open up and make available personal or institutional archives. Sharing the metadata of artworks allows others to process it and gain new insight in artworks from an angle that hasn't been possible in the past. \r\n2) To disperse the artwork's metadata independently from the artwork itself, undoing any notion of the artwork as a singular entity.\r\nThe data released: CC-Attribution-NonCommercial.", "shortname": "titledate", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An artist's archive of artwork titles", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2218266}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/titledate/", "video_url": null}
