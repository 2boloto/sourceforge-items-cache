The reason behind this is because a lot of site administrators don't need tight security - their site is just a caf\u00e9 which offers free internet access on an unsecured WLAN access point connected to the internet and they need a ticketing system to make it cumbersome for average people to use this offering without actually buying a single coffee.\r\n\r\nJkaptive itself just presents the login page,checks the token and places netfilter rules. Telling apart ticketed from unticketed traffic is done through Linux' netfilter.\r\n\r\nAs no proxy server is involved, jkaptive has no performance penalty, nor does it create problems with non-http traffic. Once the token is accepted, jkaptive is out of the way of any network packets completely.\r\n\r\nFor presenting the login page, jkaptive has a built-in webserver, so no additional webserver application is needed.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jkaptive", "_id": "501ac9a0b9363c1a69000008", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 842638, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A simple captive portal", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers", "shortname": "httpservers", "fullname": "HTTP Servers", "id": 250}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking :: Wireless", "shortname": "wireless", "fullname": "Wireless", "id": 566}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking :: Firewalls", "shortname": "firewalls", "fullname": "Firewalls", "id": 151}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Tcl", "shortname": "tcl", "fullname": "Tcl", "id": 182}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "id": 238}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Customer Service", "shortname": "customerservice", "fullname": "Customer Service", "id": 359}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
