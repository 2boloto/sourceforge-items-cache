You'll find a quick start guide that will get 3t up and running in six steps.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever wanted to keep track of the books you've read or the home maintenance you've done this might be your solution. It can be accessed from any web browser.\r\n\r\nThere is an example apache configuration file that your are welcome to use in the files download area. It will have to be edited to reflect you system paths.\r\n\r\nIf you have any trouble with the install let me know, I'll be happy to help if I can.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "db3t", "_id": "552df994c4d1045fc563ffdf", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2445589, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}], "summary": "A web based MySQL db client.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
