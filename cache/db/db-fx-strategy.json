See below for these workflow details. \r\n\r\nRationale of this project:\r\n\r\nThere will be more wrong than right in this project as it is strictly for learning to reverse engineer a real world research paper from the banking industry. This is not to include items like charting or trading execution. I am not interested in the performance of this strategy either. As a result, I keep critics, haters, and trolls at bay. This is just to keep this process transparent no different than using an open source software project model. I just hope people will contribute to make this project/process better and even correct. If you fork this, please let me know so I can further learn from your work. \r\n\r\nWhy Matlab?\r\n\r\nAs a result, I am trying to 'rapidly' generate an algorithm with Mupad, generate custom M scripts, and implement into a systematic model with Simulink and Stateflow tools.
