DBDNS just provides you with a means to get your IP from a common webbrowser to access the servers/services you wish to install on your pc.\r\n\r\nThis program can also tell you your own public IP.\r\n\r\nprogrammed in AutoHotKey_L", "shortname": "dbdns", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Free DNS", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2161997}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dbdns/", "video_url": null}
