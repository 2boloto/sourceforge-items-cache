It allows you to create simple static networks as well as complex temporal models with changing structure.\r\n\r\nIt can handle highly non-linear dependencies between multivariate random variables. The particle based inference can answer arbitrary questions given the provided evidence and can even cope with multimodal densities. The library supports the most common types of densities and conditional densities, like uniform or normal densities and facilitates user defined density functions.\r\n\r\nTo enable easy use the library is taking account of modern development techniques like policy based design and template programming.\r\n\r\nAll these properties make it applicaple for a wide range of applications.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dbnl", "_id": "50f6d637b9363c2ed76c9f45", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bugs"}, {"mount_point": "improvements", "name": "tickets", "label": "Improvements"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1236599, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Dynamic Bayesian Network Library", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "id": 133}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Library :: Research", "shortname": "research", "fullname": "Research", "id": 819}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: German", "shortname": "german", "fullname": "German", "id": 279}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}]}}
