It is fully compliant with and uses the computation methodologies as defined in the international standard ISO 9613-2. The noise level prediction plots and data can be used for permitting, regulatory applications or public consultations.  For more information on noise level prediction calculation methodologies refer to section 10 Noise Level Prediction Methodologies.\r\n\r\nOne of dB Foresight\u2019s strengths is the ability to consider site topographic data.  It computes barrier attenuation effects based on the both natural elevation contours and man-made barriers. This produces realistic, accurate noise level predictions for the assessment area. dB Foresight\u2019s simultaneous multiprocessing feature takes advantage of all the computer CPU cores to speed up the computations and reduce run time. \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dbforesight", "_id": "521fd7850910d41d13bf8043", "tools": [{"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1942327, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "Noise Impact Assessment Software", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
