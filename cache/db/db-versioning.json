As a result, it will be possible to control versions of relational database objects, such as tables, views or stored procedures together with source code of the application, hence monitor relation between source code and database schema changes, history of database schema changes and ability to automatically update a newer, or revert to an older revision.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the client supports PostgreSQL and MySQL database systems. Emphasis is put on the client to be extensible, though, so it is possible to implement a connector for another database system.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic, as a research project MUNI33/112013, http://www.muni.cz/research/projects/23565\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "db-versioning", "_id": "5121b892c4d1043f9153e8ea", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1284718, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "An extended Subversion client enabling versioning of database schemas", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Version Control :: Subversion", "shortname": "subversion", "fullname": "Subversion", "id": 646}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (DB) :: Project is a database management tool", "shortname": "db_group_mgmt", "fullname": "Project is a database management tool", "id": 511}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "fullname": "MySQL", "id": 524}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
