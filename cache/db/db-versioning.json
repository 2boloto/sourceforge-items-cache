As a result, it will be possible to control versions of relational database objects, such as tables, views or stored procedures together with source code of the application, hence monitor relation between source code and database schema changes, history of database schema changes and ability to automatically update a newer, or revert to an older revision.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the client supports PostgreSQL and MySQL database systems. Emphasis is put on the client to be extensible, though, so it is possible to implement a connector for another database system.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic, as a research project MUNI33/112013, http://www.muni.cz/research/projects/23565\r\n", "shortname": "db-versioning", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An extended Subversion client enabling versioning of database schemas", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1284718}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/db-versioning/", "video_url": null}
