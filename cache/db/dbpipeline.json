No Registration required.\r\nDeveloped with VB.NET and C#.NET programmers in mind, the DbPipeline.NET\u2122 Database Interface Library shields you, the programmer, from having to learn and work with all the ADO.NET database objects at a low level, and encapsulates all this power into objects with many additional capabilities and features that are not offered in the standard ADO.NET Framework. \r\nOur goal when designing the Library was to create an easy to use database access layer set of classes using 100% managed code so that VB.NET and C#.NET programmers can use it to build database applications (Client/Server, Web, and 3-tier) without having to be consumed with the programming involved with the retrieval, handling, management and storage in memory of the data while it is being worked on, and updating of the data. We have accomplished this, resulting in as much as a 75% reduction in source code needed to build a typical database application.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dbpipeline", "_id": "5334cb33d46bb43fa6f73ccd", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2169713, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "FREE .NET Database Library makes database programming simple!", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Database", "shortname": "database", "fullname": "Database", "id": 66}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Visual Basic .NET", "shortname": "vb_net", "fullname": "Visual Basic .NET", "id": 453}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (DB) :: Project is a database abstraction layer (API)", "shortname": "db_group_api", "fullname": "Project is a database abstraction layer (API)", "id": 510}, {"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: ADO.NET", "shortname": "adonet", "fullname": "ADO.NET", "id": 835}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: .NET/Mono", "shortname": "ui_dotnet", "fullname": ".NET/Mono", "id": 469}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
