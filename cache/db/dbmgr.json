That also needed from me to erase some sections of the code replaced by a \"TODO\" commentary with instruction (you will have to adapt those few lines to your conditions).\r\n\r\nComes with a mail alert script for errors logging and reporting, really useful for debug issues.\r\n\r\nRenaud CAMPO\r\n ", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dbmgr", "_id": "4efaf896b9363c05a00008ed", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 656509, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "MySQL Load Balancing PHP script", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "shortname": "php", "fullname": "PHP", "id": 183}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "id": 16}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "fullname": "MySQL", "id": 524}], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
