First, over-training and second, shortage of data for a training of categories. Instead, each TXT file is a category on its own, rather than an assigned category. In a way, this is similar to clustering but not really a clustering algorithm since there is some training involved. The summarizer from Classifier4J has been adjusted to accept two inputs (lets call them A and B). Then, the summarizer gets trained with A to summarize a document B, and vice versa. This extracts a relevant structure for both documents (and thus avoids the over-training) which are then compared using the Vector-Space analysis to give a range of belonging of one document to another (and thus avoids the shortage of information). This method can be used to create the user-defined classes by merging texts of certain categories and then to calculate the relevant distances between the documents, but this is not necessary.", "shortname": "txtclassifier", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Classify any two TXT documents, no training required - JAVA", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2053461}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/txtclassifier/", "video_url": null}
