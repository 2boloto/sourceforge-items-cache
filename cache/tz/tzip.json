As you know, most of compression applications on the Internet are not totally free. The business operators come up with different ideas to force you to pay, like 30-day use for trial, purchase approval, cracked version and modified version. Here, we promise that Tzip would be TOTALLY and PERMANENTLY FREE. All we want to do is bringing benefits to users and promoting technique communication. We tried our best to complete the software: thousands of times of testing, commissioning and debugging processes, adding features and functions, and designing and redesigning UIs. Finally, Tzip in the current version, with multiple functions, least bugs and excellent performance came out. We will do our best to improve it, complete it, and make it closer to the perfect. If you find any bugs of Tzip, please let us know. We promise to make continuous improvement.", "shortname": "tzip", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "https://twitter.com/tzipfree", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://facebook.com/1520922854790152", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "zip and unzip free download software", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2308462}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tzip/", "video_url": null}
