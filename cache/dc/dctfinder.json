However, getting the document creation time is a necessary step for allowing to apply temporal normalization systems to web pages. DCTFinder is a system that parses a web page and extracts from its content the title and the creation date of this web page. DCTFinder combines heuristic title detection, supervised learning with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for document date extraction, and rule-based creation time recognition. \r\n\r\nDCTFinder is released under CeCILL free software license agreement.\r\n\r\nThe system is described in the following paper (see 'Files' section):\r\nXavier Tannier. \"Extracting News Web Page Creation Time with DCTFinder\".
