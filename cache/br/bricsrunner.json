Model configuration (parameters) files are uploaded via the browser and results files are downloadable on completion.  BriCS enables researchers with software simulation models to access the rapid scale out opportunities of the cloud. \r\n\r\nWhy wait days or weeks for a series of trials to complete when you can run them in parallel in the time it takes to complete one?", "summary": "SaaS for running simulation models in the cloud", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1968387, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bricsrunner", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jpcartlidge/", "username": "jpcartlidge", "name": "John Cartlidge"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bricsrunner/screenshot/BriCS_Screen_shot-simulationPage.png", "caption": "BriCS simulation launcher, control panel.
