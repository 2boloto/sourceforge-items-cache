The main feature of the language is that the concepts of stack and dictionary are no longer distinct. In fact, dictionary words are replaced by named stacks. The process of defining a word is replaced by \"pushing\" onto a named stack, and that of executing a word is replaced by \"popping\" from a named stack. A named stack is called an application. Data and code can be moved between applications by using operations (i.e. other applications) that make use of a default stack as an intermediate. In principle, the language recognizes only numbers that can be organized into lists, which are the only form of aggregation of data/code.", "summary": "eXtensible Stack Based Language", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2388021, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "breeze-language", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mauro-di-nuzzo/", "username": "mauro-di-nuzzo", "name": "Mauro DiNuzzo"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/breeze-language/screenshot/screenshot_3.png", "caption": "Breeze Toplevel", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/breeze-language/screenshot/screenshot_3.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://breeze-language.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Project is a programming language", "fullname": "Project is a programming language", "shortname": "proglangmeta", "id": 717}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "id": 680}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Interpreters", "fullname": "Interpreters", "shortname": "interpreters", "id": 49}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "fullname": "WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "fullname": "Vista", "shortname": "vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "id": 906}]}}
