For each Development Project finance is secured from multiple investors through a reservation system, via our streamlined process the investor reserves their position, then purchases shares in a company which holds first charge on the property being developed.\r\n\r\nOnly when sufficient capital is allocated do Pipip carry out company formation, share allocation, secure a legal charge on the development property and carry out the capital transfers.
