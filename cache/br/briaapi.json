By leveraging the Application API, third-party applications can perform commands such as starting an audio or video call, answering a call or placing a call on hold.\r\n \r\nThe Bria for Desktop API was originally used by CounterPath in conjunction with a Microsoft Outlook\u00ae Add-In, to enable Bria calls to be placed from within the Outlook\u00ae application. It has therefore been \u201chardened\u201d for commercial use.\r\n \r\nCounterPath is now encouraging third-party-application developers to integrate their applications with Bria. Suggested applications range from simple functions such as enabling click-to-call from web pages, to integration with sophisticated Call Center, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Health Care applications.\r\n\r\nThis project provides sample and convenient wrapper code to utilize this API. *Note* you need a Bria desktop application to utilize the API.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "briaapi", "_id": "51d6ef21bcf63a32e35f45dc", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Forum/Help"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1892447, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Samples and wrappers around the Bria desktop API", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: Internet Phone", "shortname": "internetphone", "fullname": "Internet Phone", "id": 40}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java SWT", "shortname": "ui_swt", "fullname": "Java SWT", "id": 472}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Windows Aero", "shortname": "winaero", "fullname": "Windows Aero", "id": 763}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
