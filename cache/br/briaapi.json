By leveraging the Application API, third-party applications can perform commands such as starting an audio or video call, answering a call or placing a call on hold.\r\n \r\nThe Bria for Desktop API was originally used by CounterPath in conjunction with a Microsoft Outlook\u00ae Add-In, to enable Bria calls to be placed from within the Outlook\u00ae application. It has therefore been \u201chardened\u201d for commercial use.\r\n \r\nCounterPath is now encouraging third-party-application developers to integrate their applications with Bria. Suggested applications range from simple functions such as enabling click-to-call from web pages, to integration with sophisticated Call Center, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Health Care applications.\r\n\r\nThis project provides sample and convenient wrapper code to utilize this API. *Note* you need a Bria desktop application to utilize the API.", "shortname": "briaapi", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/counterpath", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Samples and wrappers around the Bria desktop API", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Forum/Help", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1892447}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/briaapi/", "video_url": ""}
