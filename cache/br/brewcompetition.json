If you want to use BCOE&M for your competition, it is acceptable to use the 2008 guidelines until the 2015 guidelines are integrated into the system.\r\nThe BJCP itself just published the official version of the 2015 BJCP Style Guidelines on May 5, 2015.\r\n\r\nStay tuned.", "shortname": "brewcompetition", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 259313}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/brewcompetition/", "video_url": null}
