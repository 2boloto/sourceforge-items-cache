Conventional televisions are unable to authentically replicate movies since they are comprised of twenty-four images per second. As such, they will not appear normal and will display movements that are jerky. With 24p True Cinema, there is a display of twenty-four images in progression in their exact order. They come in the succession of the film in its original form. As such, you will get the same clarity with respect to the visuals of the movie, as you would see it at the movies.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "brentguionn", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 852723}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/brentguionn/", "video_url": ""}
