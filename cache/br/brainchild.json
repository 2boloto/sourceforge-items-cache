Well make that A LOT of help if I want to finish it in the next 10 years (unless I can grow about 10 more heads and 20 more arms, lol). This is a very ambitious project for one person to even contemplate let alone develop and I'm currently in the early planning stages of prototyping both models and the practical physics that I hope to implement. \r\nTo be honest this is a ground up project and I know the odds of completion are not good but determination and commitment are great equalizers.  I hope to find some like minded people who are willing to take on a monster sized project in their free time. Experience is always a plus but not a major requirement. I\u2019m looking for intelligent, reliable, creative and artistic people to form the core group.
