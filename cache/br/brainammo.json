The important part is to get rested sleep. Snoring can turn this into a challenge, because an individual who snores often does not sleep soundly. Use the ideas in this article to help yourself get a better night of sleep.\r\nDo you snore frequently? Then watch what you eat right before bedtime. Everything from alcohol to muscle relaxants can loosen the muscles in your throat. This will cause them to be extremely relaxed, which causes snoring as air passes through. Water is the best choice for hydrating yourself before bed.\r\nGood hydration can diminish snoring. Dehydration causes thicker, more problematic mucosal secretions, which then compromise the airways and makes you more prone to snoring. Try to consume about 10 cups of water every single day, in order to reduce the chance of you snoring.", "shortname": "brainammo", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2321176}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/brainammo/", "video_url": null}
