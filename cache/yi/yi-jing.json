Much of ancient Chinese natural and social science grew from its concepts as root. The derived theories like \"Eight Diagrams\", \"Five Elements\" became the foundation of nearly all academic fields in acient Chinese. As a result, the theories are also the high concentration of many practical and statistical experience in China during her thousands-of-year history.\r\n\r\nThis project tries to realize these algorithms with statistical programming. Overcoming the long span has important meanings. First, we can verify the validity of algorithm with big data. Second, we can put them into unprecedented wide application in the age of data. Third, the unique inspection of I Ching that linked \"all the universe\" open new eyes for us in thought and methodology about interdisciplinary use of data. \r\n\r\nThis program is open-source for human. If you are interested in it, welcome to discuss and work together.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "yi-jing", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/founderfan/", "username": "founderfan", "name": "Fan Fangda"}], "external_homepage": "http://yi-jing.sourceforge.net"}
