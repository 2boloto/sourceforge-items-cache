Because geocoding is nothing without data, it provides an easy to use importer that will automagically download and import the necessary (free) data to your local database (Geonames and OpenStreetMap : 42 million entries). You can also add your own data with the Web interface or the importer connectors provided. Gisgraphy is production ready, and has been designed to be scalable(load balanced), performant and used in other languages than just java : results can be output in XML, JSON, PHP, Python, Ruby, YAML, GeoRSS, and Atom.
