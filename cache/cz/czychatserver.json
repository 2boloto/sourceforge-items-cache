Users can chat in channels (chat rooms) and via private conversations. Therefore the clients have to be connected to a CzyChat chat server. The chat server can be administrated via common client connection, console interface, CCE scripting and RCON. See the readme files for a much more detailed feature list.\r\n\r\nIt's my attempt to develop such a chat system on my own. I could not find any \"more advanced\" (means which go beyond just being only a basic example sourcecode for teaching sockets or similarities) similar client-server chat systems written in C++ so I thought it would be helpful to release it here on SourceForge.
