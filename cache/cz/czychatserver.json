Users can chat in channels (chat rooms) and via private conversations. Therefore the clients have to be connected to a CzyChat chat server. The chat server can be administrated via common client connection, console interface, CCE scripting and RCON. See the readme files for a much more detailed feature list.\r\n\r\nIt's my attempt to develop such a chat system on my own. I could not find any \"more advanced\" (means which go beyond just being only a basic example sourcecode for teaching sockets or similarities) similar client-server chat systems written in C++ so I thought it would be helpful to release it here on SourceForge. As a developer you can use this for example as a base for your own chat system, so you don't need to start from scratch.", "shortname": "czychatserver", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "CzyChat server components written in C++", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2286254}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/czychatserver/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/tg4RAlT890M?rel=0"}
