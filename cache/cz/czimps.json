It can accept input from webcams etc. and often process this in real time.   The project uses the Qt cross platform development system.   There are a lot of internal functions and tools, but the majority of the underlying functionality is due to public domain libraries which must be compiled separately and linked to this project.   (see Image Magick, Open CV, VTK, MuParser, POV-Raytracer and CombineZ)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to list all of the uses for the software, the basic idea is that you develop or download\r\na Function List which will solve some graphics problem when it is run.   Function Lists are built from simple functions, in turn the settings and properties of these functions can be altered interactively.   In essence a function list is like a program that provides easy interaction with the end user, e.g. interactive previews to alter settings.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "czimps", "_id": "538ed0a1bcf63a537295dd41", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2250666, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "A graphical user interface to  many Image Processing Functions", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
