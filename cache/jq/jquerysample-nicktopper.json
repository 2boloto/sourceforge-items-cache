One section of the document contained a list of events, each event had a time, date, description, and a \"mark as favorite\" check box. Another section of the document had a \"my favorites\" section, a set of list items for each event at the conference. These list items were separated by \"divider\" type list items that each represented a particular time slot on each day of the conference.\r\n\r\nMy task:\r\nAll of the list items in the \"my favorites\" section were to be made invisible. When an \"add to favorites\" check box was selected, the visibility of the corresponding list item in the \"my favorites\" section of the document was to be set according to the state of the check box. And the list 'divider' for each time slot should only be visible if there is at least one event in that time slot marked as a \"favorite\". \r\n\r\nStates must also remain persistent between sessions This is my solution.
