The use of the model enables effort estimation from non-experts (e.g. not developers).\r\n\r\n    Work Breakdown Estimation\r\n\r\nThis is an effort estimation method based on expert judgment. Two options are available: Delphic Oracle and Three Point Estimation.\r\n\r\n    Analogy / Comparison Estimation\r\n\r\nThis method tries to find analogies and/or compares the project to be estimated with stored projects.\r\n\r\n    Custom modular estimation for WEB and Mobile\r\n\r\nFinally, I have included a custom modular estimation method. Using this method you can use prior efforts estimations for small modules/pieces of work that can be found in most projects in order to create complicated project estimation.\r\n\r\nThe tool can be feeded with custom modules estimations for use in future project estimations.", "shortname": "effort-estimate", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Estimate software development effort with 5 different methods", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1283042}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/effort-estimate/", "video_url": ""}
