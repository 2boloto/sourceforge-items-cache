As one user put it ``EFAX is a nice simple\r\nprogram for single user systems.''\r\n\r\nThe ``fax'' command, a shell script, lets you send, receive, view\r\nand print faxes.

To fax Postscript files you will\r\nneed Ghostscript.  To view faxes you can use any program that\r\ndisplays PGM files (e.g. xloadimage or xv).  efix can convert\r\nreceived files to Postscript or HP Laserjet formats for printing.\r\n\r\nThis version of the program was written & tested under Linux 2.0.\r\nPrevious versions have been compiled and used under most versions\r\nof Unix and should work with minor changes on any Unix with an\r\nANSI C com", "shortname": "efax", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "small ANSI C/POSIX program that sends and receives faxes using fax", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2391836}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/efax/", "video_url": null}
