As one user put it ``EFAX is a nice simple\r\nprogram for single user systems.''\r\n\r\nThe ``fax'' command, a shell script, lets you send, receive, view\r\nand print faxes.  In larger systems, faxes can be sent by\r\nprinting to a ``fax'' printer and received faxes can be e-mailed\r\nas MIME attachments to an administrator for distribution.  efax\r\ncan also pass incoming data calls to a getty program.\r\n\r\nThe efax package includes ``efix,'' a program to convert between\r\nvarious image file formats.  To fax Postscript files you will\r\nneed Ghostscript.  To view faxes you can use any program that\r\ndisplays PGM files (e.g. xloadimage or xv).  efix can convert\r\nreceived files to Postscript or HP Laserjet formats for printing.\r\n\r\nThis version of the program was written & tested under Linux 2.0.\r\nPrevious versions have been compiled and used under most versions\r\nof Unix and should work with minor changes on any Unix with an\r\nANSI C com", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "efax", "_id": "54b2b9661be1ce1d8cbbf0e7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2391836, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "small ANSI C/POSIX program that sends and receives faxes using fax", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
