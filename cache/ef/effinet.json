Real-time optimal control deals with operating the main flow and pressure actuators to meet demands using the most sustainable sources and minimizing electricity costs and is tackled using stochastic model predictive control techniques. Real-time monitoring of water quantity; and quality refers to the continuous detection and location of leakage and or water quality problems. It uses fault detection and diagnosis techniques. Demand forecasting and management is based on smart metering techniques and includes detailed modelling of consumption patterns as well as a service of communication to consumers. The project will provide an integrated software platform and two real-life pilot demonstrations in Barcelona (Spain) and Lemesos (Cyprus), respectively.", "shortname": "effinet", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Real-time Monitoring & Control of Drinking Water Networks", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1256687}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/effinet/", "video_url": ""}
