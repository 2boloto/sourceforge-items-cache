These profiles contain your IP, search history, and other information. For more information regarding exactly what Google uses this information for, DuckDuckGo has a good website that explains it all at donttrack.us. effgoogle is a ridiculously tiny and simple python program that opens up a user-specified number of Firefox instances, opens Google, and searches random phrases and common searches. This confuses Google and makes it more difficult for you to be tracked. There's also an option for effgoogle to make a list of phrases to be searched by harvesting google search suggestions and random titles of Wikipedia pages. Works with python 2.7 under Ubuntu linux, support for different python versions and oses soon to come. effgoogle is completely free and licensed under the Beerware license.", "shortname": "effgoogle", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "effgoogle protects your privacy by confusing Google's profile of you.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2293128}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/effgoogle/", "video_url": null}
