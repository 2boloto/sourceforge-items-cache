Thanks for your interest!\r\n\r\nAMBIENT (Active Modules for Bipartite Networks) is a Python module that uses simulated annealing to find areas of a metabolic network (modules) that have some consistent characteristic.  AMBIENT does not require predefined pathways and gives highly specific predictions of affected areas of metabolism.\r\n\r\nFor example, scores for reactions based on transcriptional data of their annotated encoding genes can be used in the network and modules of coordinated expression changes can be found.  This provides an alternative to pathway/gene set enrichment analyses which is simultaneously more flexible and more specific.", "shortname": "ambient-bio", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Find active modules in metabolic networks using high-throughput data", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code1", "mount_point": "code1", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 724267}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ambient-bio/", "video_url": ""}
