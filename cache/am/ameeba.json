Not only that, but you can browse by all of your taxonomies simultaneously.\r\n\r\nTo see an example of this concept in action have a look at the Science page of the Open Directory Project (http://www.dmoz.org/Science/). \r\n\r\nThe links are categorized by scientific field, again by a collection of miscellaneous categories, and again by language. Click a link in one taxonomy and the contents of the other taxonomies update to reflect a more refined search. In this way you are browsing by all three at once.\r\n\r\nAmeeba lets you build these same kinds of directories for yourself instead of locking you into a single taxonomy like other directory managers.", "shortname": "ameeba", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "PHP-based directory manager with a little something extra", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 647002}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ameeba/", "video_url": ""}
