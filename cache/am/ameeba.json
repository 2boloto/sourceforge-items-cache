Not only that, but you can browse by all of your taxonomies simultaneously.\r\n\r\nTo see an example of this concept in action have a look at the Science page of the Open Directory Project (http://www.dmoz.org/Science/). \r\n\r\nThe links are categorized by scientific field, again by a collection of miscellaneous categories, and again by language. Click a link in one taxonomy and the contents of the other taxonomies update to reflect a more refined search. In this way you are browsing by all three at once.\r\n\r\nAmeeba lets you build these same kinds of directories for yourself instead of locking you into a single taxonomy like other directory managers.", "summary": "PHP-based directory manager with a little something extra", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 647002, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ameeba", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bonecone/", "username": "bonecone", "name": "bonecone"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ameeba/screenshot/browse.png", "caption": "Browsing the Ameeba directory structure", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ameeba/screenshot/browse.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ameeba/screenshot/create_taxonomy.png", "caption": "Creating new taxonomies is simple", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ameeba/screenshot/create_taxonomy.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "fullname": "MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "id": 524}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Indexing/Search", "fullname": "Indexing/Search", "shortname": "indexing", "id": 93}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management", "fullname": "Site Management", "shortname": "sitemanagement", "id": 243}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CMS Systems", "fullname": "CMS Systems", "shortname": "cms", "id": 644}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Management", "fullname": "Management", "shortname": "management", "id": 725}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
