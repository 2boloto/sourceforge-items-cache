The system will be used to manage and keep track of all the technological assets at the iSchool.\r\n\r\nThe mobile application will be designed for a camera equipped mobile device.  It will facilitate the process of scanning and adding items to the database at a much faster rate and in a more accurate manner than the application in use currently.  Since the application will be installed on a mobile device, it will increase convenience and flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe software will be a revamped version of Loan Shark, the current system used to loan laptops and peripherals.  The new version of Loan Shark will be able to provide real time information due to its amalgamation with the inventory management system, Loading Dock.  The new version of Loan shark will also be able to detect the type of device scanned and determine its eligibility for loan based on rules and regulations set by the iCommons.\r\n", "shortname": "iits", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "iits", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "test", "mount_point": "test", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 677444}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/iits/", "video_url": ""}
