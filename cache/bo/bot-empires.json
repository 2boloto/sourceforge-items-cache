By choosing one of six major races aim is to gain control and supremacy over a part of the galaxy, either by diplomatic or military means. Further victory conditions are available at game start.\r\n\r\nDue to AI, adjustable difficulty level and a large galaxy map within up to 140 minor races long-term pleasure is sure - on your own or with friends. BotE provides single- or multiplayer mode (LAN, internet), runs at 32- or 64bit Windows and even at Linux (using Wine). BotE is available in German or English, further languages or many other options are moddable.\r\n\r\nThis hobby fan project started in January 2004 and is continually developed by the BotE-Team and the fans.
