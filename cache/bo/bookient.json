Our Team leader had gained over 10 years of experience in scheduling solutions through his past position with a leading scheduling solution provider. During this time the need for a next generation scheduling solution became clear and was supported by customer feedback. \u201cWe had witnessed first hand the demands brought about from moving scheduling on-line and the opportunities this presented for the future of scheduling solutions.\u201d\r\n\r\nToday, electronic scheduling solutions are expected by the customers of service industry businesses. We at Bookient feel there is an opportunity for a scheduling solution to be so much more than just a reservation management tool. It has the potential to become a way for service sector businesses to manage their entire business operations through a single solution.
