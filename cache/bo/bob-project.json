It can be used as disaster recovery, and had been designed to support multiple sites / environments with thousands of servers. Bob is secure, quick, and simple.\r\n\r\nManaging IT infrastructure should not be a chore. Recent system management tools have been built around using cfengine or ruby. Why should a system administrator have to be a developer? Why do they need to learn a new language? Operating systems have already solved this problem, it's called file system. In UNIX everything is a file. If you can use an editor, you already know bob.\r\n\r\nYes, it is that simple.\r\n\r\nWhy bob? Because it's Bob The Builder - yes we can!", "summary": "Quick, simple, intuitive, powerul UNIX system management solution.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 503924, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "donate", "name": "link", "label": "Donate"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bob-project", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/visrailevich65/", "username": "visrailevich65", "name": "Vadim Israilevich"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://bob-project.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "id": 460}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Unix Shell", "fullname": "Unix Shell", "shortname": "shell", "id": 185}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "fullname": "BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 187}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: File-based DBMS :: Flat-file", "fullname": "Flat-file", "shortname": "db_file_flat", "id": 521}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Operating System Kernels :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 143}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Installation/Setup", "fullname": "Installation/Setup", "shortname": "setup", "id": 147}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: OS distribution", "fullname": "OS distribution", "shortname": "osdistro", "id": 798}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}]}}
