It can be used as disaster recovery, and had been designed to support multiple sites / environments with thousands of servers. Bob is secure, quick, and simple.\r\n\r\nManaging IT infrastructure should not be a chore. Recent system management tools have been built around using cfengine or ruby. Why should a system administrator have to be a developer? Why do they need to learn a new language? Operating systems have already solved this problem, it's called file system. In UNIX everything is a file. If you can use an editor, you already know bob.\r\n\r\nYes, it is that simple.\r\n\r\nWhy bob?
