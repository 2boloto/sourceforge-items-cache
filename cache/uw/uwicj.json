The search part is done concurrently by several threads that allows UWICJ to scale with the number of CPU's. Modification part is done in bulks by a single thread when the limit on the bulk is reached. \r\nUWICJ benefits from the fact that some words are more frequent and it processes such words faster than the others.UWICJ automatically adjusts itself to the changing frequencies of the words so that it preserves its performance benefits.\r\nPlease, send your comments and questions to uwicj at yahoo dot com", "shortname": "uwicj", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Unique Words \"Infinite\" Counter", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 748898}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/uwicj/", "video_url": ""}
