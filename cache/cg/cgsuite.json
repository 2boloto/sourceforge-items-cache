Well-known examples include Chess, Checkers, Go, and Dots-and-Boxes. An elegant mathematical theory of such games was described by Berlekamp, Conway and Guy in the book Winning Ways (originally published 1982).\r\n\r\nCombinatorial Game Suite is a computer algebra system for fast calculations within this theory. It is designed as a research and educational tool for students and professionals working in the field. Some background knowledge in combinatorial game theory is assumed.\r\n\r\nFeatures include a customized scripting language (CGScript) for automating such calculations and a full-featured GUI. First-time users (including users new to 1.X, but familiar with prior versions) are encouraged to work through the tutorial. To access the tutorial, first download and install CGSuite, and then select \"Getting Started\" from the Help menu.", "shortname": "cgsuite", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A computer algebra system for research in combinatorial game theory.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 73762}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Cvs", "mount_point": "cvs", "name": "cvs"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cgsuite/", "video_url": null}
