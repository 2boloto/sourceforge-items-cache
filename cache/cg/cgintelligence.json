Usually many operations in 3D workflow are highly retundant and often actions have to be repeaded several times or instead being executed in selfmade scripts.Scripting is in fact for most people a very nasty and time consuming action.\r\n\r\nThis application module tries to fill the gap where it lerns workflows which can in order be modified, multiplied, adapted organically to allow a fast and versatile Workflows, where currently rigit working habits will not Compete.\r\n\r\n...also making scripting finally obsolete.\r\n\r\ncurrently the developement is started with Autodesk Maya. More 3D platforms will come after this project is succeding.", "summary": "What happens if you cross artificial intelligence with 3D", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 787375, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cgintelligence", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/freshnfunky/", "username": "freshnfunky", "name": "freshNfunky "}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cgintelligence/screenshot/IMaya_01.jpg", "caption": "iMaya_Window_alpha.0.1.1", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cgintelligence/screenshot/IMaya_01.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "www.felixschaller.com", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "fullname": "Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "id": 479}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "fullname": "Python", "shortname": "python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "fullname": "BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 187}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics", "fullname": "Graphics", "shortname": "graphics", "id": 100}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics :: Animation", "fullname": "Animation", "shortname": "animation", "id": 766}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics :: Editors :: Metadata editors", "fullname": "Metadata editors", "shortname": "metadata", "id": 803}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "fullname": "Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "id": 5}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "fullname": "All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 202}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
