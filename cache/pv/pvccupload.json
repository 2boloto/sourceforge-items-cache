The suite currently supports SMA inverters and Current Cost meters. It was primarily designed to work with United States based inverter configurations using the U.S. NEC (section 690) electrical code requirements for back feed breakers with Current Cost meter configurations. However this feature may turned off and can be adapted to any Current Cost and/or SMA inverter configuration. Please see the features WIKI page for a description of the features of PVccupload. The suite is relatively easy and straight forward to configure and operate. The programs are small, light weight and consume only minimal system resources. They are particularly suited for running on a Raspberry PI. An example system using these programs may be seen at: http://pvoutput.org/intraday.jsp?id=11746&sid=9707 or http://pvoutput.org/intraday.jsp?id=11746&sid=12966\r\n", "shortname": "pvccupload", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A dedicated 24x7 linux based power monitoring solution ", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2015877}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pvccupload/", "video_url": ""}
