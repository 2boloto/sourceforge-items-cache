It takes a Winamp playlist (or a playlist that you saved in some other, similar music player), finds the music files, and copies them to a single location such as a folder, USB stick, portable device, or network location. The copied files can keep their original form, or alternatively you can add numbers to the beginning of their names. If you wish, you can ask the program to create a batch file copy_files.bat in the same folder where the M3U Export Tool is located. This is for administrators who wish under special circumstances to perform the copying using the administrator rights. These rights can be obtained by right-clicking the Command Prompt and selecting Run as administrator. Next, you only need to type in the script name.
