I completed the project as part of my dissertation, and produced software to render Maya script (MEL) to animate a piano model I'd also created. From this I produced a number of videos, which I uploaded periodically to YouTube. Following numerous request I attempted to create a standalone application to playback MIDI performances without the need for a 3rd party 3d modelling/rendering application such as Maya. Given my original background in Java, and it's existing support for MIDI files, I proceeded to attempt to create this using Java 3D. However, (and this sounds like an excuse, which it probably is), life got in the way and I never completed the project to a commercial standard for reproduction. As such, I'm offering the source here in good will to other developers/musicians who might be able to take what I've achieved and carry it forward to a useful learning tool.", "shortname": "pianissimo", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A java 3D project for live rendering of a MIDI piano performance", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Pianissimo - Code", "mount_point": "pianissimo", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 895977}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pianissimo/", "video_url": ""}
