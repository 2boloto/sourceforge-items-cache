PictureFilter is a simple tool that helps you to find similar pictures by name, file size, and date time at which the picture is taken. And then you can remove the duplicated pictures in one click. You can also look into the EXIF info easily with this tool. and you can also easily copy, resize and save picture(s) to create a album. Right click on the main image view to bring the context menu.
