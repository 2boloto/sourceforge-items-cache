I didn't like that, so, pViewer was born. And that's why everything in pViewer is done with the right click menu and keyboard shortcuts. I also didn't want to use two different viewers for viewing images and for reading comics, and that's why pViewer have a Manga/Comic mode. This project is written in C#, and uses the .NET Framework 4, which you need to run the software:\r\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851\r\n\r\nI strongly suggest to open and read the Keyboard Shortcuts/Help menu in the software before starting to use it.
