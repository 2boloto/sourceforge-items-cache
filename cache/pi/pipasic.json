However, difficulties arise due to the high sequence similarity between related organisms.

These challenges are similar but not identical to the challenges arising in the analysis of metagenomic samples and require specific solutions.\r\n\r\npipasic (peptide intensity-weighted proteome abundance similarity correction) is a tool which corrects identification and spectral counting based quantification results using peptide similarity estimation and expression level weighting within a non-negative lasso framework. pipasic has distinct advantages over approaches only regarding unique peptides or aggregating results to the lowest common ancestor.", "shortname": "pipasic", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "pipasic: Protein Abundance Correction in Metaproteomic Data", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2039431}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pipasic/", "video_url": ""}
