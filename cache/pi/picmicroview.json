It's not intended to ever be a fully functional simulator. It is meant to allow people to practice and learn without having to have the actual hardware hooked up. A user will be able to write an assembly language program, assemble it, and \"upload\" it to the microprocessor, inspect internals and observe results.\r\n\r\nI am a student in West Virginia. This project is most likely going to be my senior project. I'm a junior, so I'm getting an early start! \r\n\r\nMost likely gui will be implemented using qt5. Please see the picMicroViewBlog for current status. Since this is a student project, I've decided to use the blog as a journal to document when I decided to do what, and progress, etc. \r\n\r\nAlso, please comment. Guidance and direction are greatly appreciated!\r\n", "shortname": "picmicroview", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "pic 18f452 trainer and internals viewer", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2039759}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "picMicroViewBlog", "mount_point": "picmicroviewblog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/picmicroview/", "video_url": null}
