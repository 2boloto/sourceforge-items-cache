This emulates old arcade games using MAME based roms for CPS1, CPS2, Neogeo, Toaplan and many other games. It should support most recent versions of the MAME versions of these ROMS but unfortnately there is no definitive version to use. A full list of supported games is in the frontend program.\r\n\r\nSome large ROMS may require converting to the '.fba' format before they will work. FBACache_windows.zip is included to do this, which runs on Windows not Linux.\r\n\r\nA clrmamepro/romcenter DAT file is included 'fba_029671_clrmame_dat.zip' which supports most of the ROMS that work and can generate compatible ROMS from recent versions of MAME.\r\n\r\nA number of games will not work properly, some are so large they appear to run out of memory.", "shortname": "pifba", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Final Burn Alpha 2x for Raspberry Pi", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2409875}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pifba/", "video_url": null}
