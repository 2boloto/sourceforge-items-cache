I have a B.Sc. in Computer Applications from Dublin City University and I have a keen interest in Physics.\r\n\r\nThe Theory includes a Quantum Theory of Gravity as well as a reworking of Classical versions of Newton's Formulas. There is a reworking of Navier Stokes which includes Turbulence and a treatment of Fluid Dynamics. Also, the Theory is based on a set of Relativistic Diagrams called Pi-Space Diagrams for those new to the Theory. The Theory is fully Relativistic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory contains a notation for unifying classical physics with relativistic physics. The theory also includes a Quantum theory of Gravity formulation and includes descriptions on the reason for turbulence and aerodynamic lift plus drag.\r\n\r\nLicense :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0\r\n", "shortname": "pispacephysicssoftware", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Physics Theory for Unifying Classical, Quantum and Relativistic Phys", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1991668}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pispacephysicssoftware/", "video_url": null}
