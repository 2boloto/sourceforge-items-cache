You can add nearly anything to your projects and connect it with everything else.\r\n\r\nThe Application allows you to create groups with your friends and share your projects. It is also possible to share a project among friends without beeing in a group or even make them available online for the community.\r\n\r\nEach User has its own privileges, so you can set the privileges of the group members or project participants.\r\n\r\nWithin a project you can add so called pages. On each page you can create a new mindmap. This allows you to manage single steps within a process like information gathering, implementation, updating and much more in a single mind map. Pages can be embedded within a page, these are called sub pages. More than that, you are able to share pages between projects!\r\n\r\nOur goal is to be listed on the of concept- and mind-mapping Software / Wikipedia Page.
