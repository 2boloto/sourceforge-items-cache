It also includes the support files necessary to prepare digital charts as downloadable tiles and a point of sale web site used by end users to obtain the charts.\r\n\r\nThe viewer's features includes generating track points, which can be saved as GPX. The viewer can also be used to plot flights.\r\n\r\nThe point of sale purchase system is Drupal based with a MySQL database. The remote device connects to the database using a Glassfish server and Jersey.\r\n\r\nThis app has been available on Apple's iTunes App Store for over two years and has a 4+ star ratings. I have moved on to other things and while I've been maintaining it I'd like to see it continue to improve. That's is why I'm releasing it as an open source project.", "shortname": "pilotschartviewer", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "FAA digital chart viewer for iPhone and iPad", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2055817}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pilotschartviewer/", "video_url": ""}
