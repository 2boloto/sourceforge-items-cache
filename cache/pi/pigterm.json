PigTerm connects you to your/your friends/your office Linux computer's terminal trough Jabber messaging (XMPP Protocol services like Gtalk).

The complete code of this library is imported into source tree so that you do not need to compile and install that first.\r\n\r\nAll communication is encrypted using QCA Library. The software does not involve with export control regulations as in QCA (http://delta.affinix.co/docs/qca/) Site they wrote:\r\nFunctionality is supplied via plugins. ... . Also, by pushing crypto functionality into plugins, your application is free of legal issues, such as export regulations.\r\n", "shortname": "pigterm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Remote control your linux console encrypted trough Jabber chat service", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2067520}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pigterm/", "video_url": null}
