It is licensed under the AGPLv3 as published by the Free Software Foundation on 19 November 2007. The coding language is C++11 making use of object orientation and polymorphism. It is intended to work on all POSIX-compliant (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like) operating systems and on some embedded devices, e.g., Zynq based devices like the ZedBoard or the MicroZed supporting the AXI interface to communicate between the Processing System (PS) aka CPU and the Programmable Logic (PL) aka FPGA.
