This property is not compromized by the notorious temporal inconsisteny of S3 caused by the eventual consistency model,\r\nfault tolerance: any component of Secor is allowed to crash at any given point without compromising data integrity,\r\nload distribution: Secor may be distributed across multiple machines,\r\nhorizontal scalability: scaling the system out to handle more load is as easy as starting extra Secor processes. Reducing the resource footprint can be achieved by killing any of the running Secor processes. Neither ramping up nor down has any impact on data consistency,\r\noutput partitioning: Secor parses incoming messages and puts them under partitioned s3 paths to enable direct import into systems like ", "shortname": "pinterestsecor", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Secor is a service persisting Kafka logs to Amazon S3", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2390533}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pinterestsecor/", "video_url": null}
