This is an old version of SNES9X but was chosen as it runs mostly at full speed on the Raspberry Pi unlike the more recent versions of SNES9X. Game support is therefore not as good as the newer SNES9X versions and graphics & sound is not as accurate.\r\n\r\nGames that will not work, for example, are Yoshi's Island, Street Fighter Alpha 2, Star Fox.\r\n\r\nThis port supports keyboard and USB joystick input and are configurable. It uses GLES2/dispmanx for graphics so can run equally well in the Console or under X-Windows. The audio uses the ALSA API and SDL is used for input.\r\n", "shortname": "pisnes", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "SNES emulator for Raspberry Pi", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1932260}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pisnes/", "video_url": null}
