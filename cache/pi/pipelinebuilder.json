It helps the user in composing NGS tool commands and composing his own analysis pipeline. It allows for data independent reproducible analysis creating protected environment which separates data from results through variable exportation. It comes as a command-line tool with a wizard menus and step-by-step tutorials.\r\n\r\nPipeline Builder is written in Perl and it is crossplatform.
