Thus, P7 has been revived as part of clip-rpg. For those of you wondering, this should not affect the ability of P7 to run independently of clip-rpg. The new project page can be found at https://github.com/foxhead128/clip-rpg\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Seeing P7's relative lack of success in the face of more popular and fully-featured competition such as Ren'Py, I have decided to suspend development permanently. You're free to fork P7 if you so desire.\r\n\r\nP7 (formerly PieNovel) is an open-source, command-line based visual novel/choose-your-own-adventure engine coded in Python 3.
