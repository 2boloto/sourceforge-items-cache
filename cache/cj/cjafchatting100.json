It listens on port 4546, so be sure to port forward port 4546. It is also  compatible with Hamachi, so you don't need to portforward.\r\nThe zip file comes with two apps:\r\nThe CJAFClient and CJAFServer.\r\nThe CJAFServer runs and listens on port 4546 for a client to make a connection. The CJAFClient attempts to connect to the IP that you give it at startup, and if the connection is successful, the Server and client may choose a username and start chatting! \r\nThe Server has a feature that also listens for certain messages. If the Client says 'Ping!',  the Server responds with 'Pong!', but only the client can see the 'Pong!' message.", "summary": "A sweet, small chatting app that runs on java.
