Two to eight players, divided into two teams, battle each other on a desolate alien world. Each team's goal is to collect a certain amount of alien artifacts while constantly being under attack by the opposing team and AI controlled aliens. Hostile Worlds' core experience consists of choosing your own tactic and play style by constantly customizing your squad during the game: Several unit types are available and each comes with a unique set of characteristic abilities which can be unlocked by leveling up. Each squad's backbone is the commander who provides crucial abilities like healing and cloaking.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hostileworlds", "_id": "503bbcb01be1ce4c7d09e2fe", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 871760, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Hostile Worlds is a squad based real-time tactics multiplayer game.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Multiplayer", "shortname": "multiplayer", "fullname": "Multiplayer", "id": 774}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Real Time Tactical", "shortname": "realtimetactical", "fullname": "Real Time Tactical", "id": 847}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other License", "id": 196}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
