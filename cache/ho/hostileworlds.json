Two to eight players, divided into two teams, battle each other on a desolate alien world.

Hostile Worlds' core experience consists of choosing your own tactic and play style by constantly customizing your squad during the game: Several unit types are available and each comes with a unique set of characteristic abilities which can be unlocked by leveling up. Each squad's backbone is the commander who provides crucial abilities like healing and cloaking.", "shortname": "hostileworlds", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Hostile Worlds is a squad based real-time tactics multiplayer game.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 871760}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/hostileworlds/", "video_url": ""}
