To address this limitation we created HostDesigner, a code that builds and evaluates millions of molecules in minutes.  This command line executable builds 3D molecular structures by covalently connecting user-defined input fragments with pre-computed hydrocarbon fragments from a library.  The results are ranked with respect to desired geometric constraints defined by the user.
