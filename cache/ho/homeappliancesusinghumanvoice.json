The voice command is a person independent. The system comprises of transmitting section and receiving section. Initially, the voice command is stored in the data base with the help of the function keys. Then the input voice commands are transmitted through microphone. The voice received is processed in the voice recognition system where the feature of the voice command is extracted and matched with the existing sample in the database. The module recognizes the voice and sends control messages to the microcontroller. The programmed microcontroller then processes the received data and switches the respective appliances via connected driver circuits. The output is also shown on a LCD display i.e. which appliance is ON or OFF.", "shortname": "homeappliancesusinghumanvoice", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "aim behind making this project is to control any electrical appliances", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2445068}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/homeappliancesusinghumanvoice/", "video_url": null}
