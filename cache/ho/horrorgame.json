And an enemy, of course, which wanders around the map and starts chasing you if he sees you.\r\n\r\nYou only have a compass and a lamp, which you can refill with oil cans scattered around the room.\r\n\r\nYou can also run, but the more your stamina is drained, the slower you'll run.\r\n\r\nThe door emits a bell sound when you're getting closer to it, and the key leaves marks on the floor that lead to it.\r\n\r\nBut you can never exactly tell from the sound is coming, and the marks can sometimes be misleading and hard to follow.\r\n\r\nThe monster also emits a sound when he approaches you, but he can make you deaf for a moment if you stare at it.\r\n\r\nGameplay videos:\r\n\r\nv2.0\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGK-ZqTF_6Q\r\n\r\nv1.5\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEKVD63ryhQ\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "horrorgame", "_id": "5021a67b1be1ce0b006b5bd6", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 845809, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A small bizarre early-3D horror game.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "id": 80}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0", "shortname": "ccanclv2", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0", "id": 871}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: ADO.NET", "shortname": "adonet", "fullname": "ADO.NET", "id": 835}], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
