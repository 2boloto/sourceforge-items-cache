It does not work with Python 3.x.x, as a lot of things changed since the update, and many Python scripts are still using v2.7.6.\r\n\r\nCURRENT VERSION: v1.1\r\n\r\nThis script will calculate the total number of hours you worked in EC in order to meet the minimum required number of hours. Just follow the instructions on screen, and the script will print out the total number of hours for you. Easier than calculating it individually!\r\n\r\nNote: The current version is 1.1, not 1.0 because I updated the 1.0 code, but accidentally deleted it from both my computer and my storage cloud.
