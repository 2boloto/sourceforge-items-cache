This is done by fighting, or avoiding the enemies such as bandits and mutants and collecting keys to open locked doors to new areas. 3 weapons are available but ammo is limited. Health and ammo kits are available to help you along the way, but bandits are just as capable of using them as you are.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hotlinechipsmassacre", "_id": "53edfb2a3e5e8345f532df15", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2305815, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "shortname": "sidescrolling", "fullname": "Side-Scrolling/Arcade Games", "id": 288}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
