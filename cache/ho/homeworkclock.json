Its purpose is to let the user know how much time they spend on working and how much time they spend off-task.\r\n\r\nThe Homework Clock has 2 timers. One keeps track of the time spent on working, the other keeps track of the time spent off task. At the most basic level, the Homework Clock can switch, stop, and clear timers. Only one timer will be running at a time.\r\n\r\nThe Homework Clock has many other features, including a ratio and auto switching. For more information, see the FAQ section.
