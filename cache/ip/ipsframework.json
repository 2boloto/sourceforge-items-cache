However, the design is quite general, and is suitable for many scientific and engineering domains.  In addition to plasma physics, it is also being used in the engineering of batteries.\r\n\r\nOne of the novel features of the IPS framework is its ability to support parallelism at multiple levels: components can launch individual parallel tasks, and also launch multiple tasks concurrently.
