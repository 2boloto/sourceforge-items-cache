Then use iPod Music Extractor to automate the extraction of your music from your iPod in minutes. This application was written in Perl and will include a simple GUI for anyone that does not want to use the shell terminal. Tested only on the MacOSX operating system and will have Linux and Windows compatibility in the future. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: This program was meant to be used by the owner of the iPod to be extracted. Any misuse of this program involving illegal file sharing is strictly prohibited and on the end user to comply with this user agreement and that of the iPod from Apple Inc. I made this program to make it faster, easier, and more efficient for me to get my music off my iPod in order to put more music on the device I own, enjoy! \r\n\r\nPlease leave a comment or any feedback you have or give me an email at ksm272@mail.usask.ca if you have any questions.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ipodmusicextractor", "_id": "52d4d59d24b0d95dfe916dac", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2072042, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Automates the extraction of music from your iPod!", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
