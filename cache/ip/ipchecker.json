Bred out of necessity, this is actually my very first finished and compiled application ever. Great to use if you are attempting to troubleshoot someone's system remotely and they are not knowledgeable enough to run this from the command line. Although, I find it easier to run than going the traditional route. Plans soon to expand the functionality greatly for a more robust data capture tool.
