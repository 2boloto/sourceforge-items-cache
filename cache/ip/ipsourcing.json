End users recognize that Internet becomes more and more a content distribution system rather than a communication platform. In this project, we aim at developing Semantic Internet which addresses content-centric networking and M2M communication. We change the way Internet operates. Internet becomes the knowledge. The metadata of the content of the IPv6 packets and the capabilities of the device is inserted into the IPv6 options header. Routers (machines) process packets and establish a semantic database. We call this concept as IP sourcing. Any unencrypted IP packet enables populating the semantic database and Internet becomes a very large independent, distributed information center. Any web search, tweet or communication may help Internet build an information database.", "shortname": "ipsourcing", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Semantic Internet and IPSourcing: Internet becomes the knowledge.", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 631984}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ipsourcing/", "video_url": ""}
