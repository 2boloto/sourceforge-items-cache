There are very few tools for comprehensive IPA input available, some of those are strictly online, some of them cost money, and others yet are difficult to install and operate. I tried to make a free to use, free to distribute IPA keyboard for linguists to use both at home / in the office, and during fieldwork. So far the project is in its preliminary stages, as I have not received any major feedback, but if it interests other people I will continue developing it. Nevertheless, the input is fully usable, and contains a large number of IPA characters (almost all of them, in fact), and several diacritics.", "shortname": "ipa-input", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An IPA keyboard layout for linguists (usable only in Windows)", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2195728}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ipa-input/", "video_url": null}
