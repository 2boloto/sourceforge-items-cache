There are very few tools for comprehensive IPA input available, some of those are strictly online, some of them cost money, and others yet are difficult to install and operate. I tried to make a free to use, free to distribute IPA keyboard for linguists to use both at home / in the office, and during fieldwork. So far the project is in its preliminary stages, as I have not received any major feedback, but if it interests other people I will continue developing it. Nevertheless, the input is fully usable, and contains a large number of IPA characters (almost all of them, in fact), and several diacritics.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ipa-input", "_id": "534e11e71be1ce1a3f015110", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2195728, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "An IPA keyboard layout for linguists (usable only in Windows)", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
