I have written an AI in c++ which can respond to over 150000 questions and conversational inputs. I'm looking for people who have knowledge of operating systems, and programming (assembly level, kernels, etc.) because i would like to turn this into an operating system, once complete, i will need people to help make this AI even smarter, however the AI can never be truely complete because software updates could always be made, but that is another thing..\r\n\r\nIn Conclusion what i am looking for are some people willing to devote their time to help make Ian, the AI into an operating system, and i need people who know how to program in assembly and c++, and have a good understanding of operating systems.. I look forward to working with you, thanks", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ian-the-ai", "_id": "538249e404161f3c79ddcfda", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2241677, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "I am trying to make an AI, not just a program though, an OS", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
