Successful attacks have been demonstrated against standard cryptographic algo-\r\nrithms implemented on a wide variety of common platforms. In order to protect against these attacks, designers must incorporate complex countermeasures into the implementation of sensitive operations. Validating the effectiveness of implementation attack\r\ncountermeasures requires specialized expertise and techniques not commonly used in other types of security and functional testing. We propose a modular testing environment for use in verifying the implementation attack resistance of secure systems.
