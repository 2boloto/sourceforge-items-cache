This will be updated once I have something I feel is worth showing. \r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent plans:\r\n\r\nChoice to use alternate systems for things such as player/monster combat, rather than 1 fixed style of game.\r\n\r\nChoice to use 2d or 3d art for objects/players/etc.\r\n\r\nLua for server side scripting.\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL for server side database. Eventual multiple database support (mysql etc).\r\n\r\nsqlite for client side database functions (for data not sent to a server, as in an offline game).\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "eternal-engine", "_id": "5371752cbcf63a551dc49513", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2226530, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Role-Playing", "shortname": "rpg", "fullname": "Role-Playing", "id": 84}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: MMORPG", "shortname": "mmorpg", "fullname": "MMORPG", "id": 775}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Game development framework", "shortname": "gameframeworks", "fullname": "Game development framework", "id": 794}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Lua", "shortname": "lua", "fullname": "Lua", "id": 450}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache License V2.0", "shortname": "apache2", "fullname": "Apache License V2.0", "id": 401}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "shortname": "db_net_pgsql", "fullname": "PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "id": 525}], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
