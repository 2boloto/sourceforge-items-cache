When my son (Ethan) was a toddler, he loved to impulsively bang his hands on the mouse and keyboard while I was doing something on it.  It would ruin what I was doing and cause heartburn.  I wrote this program so I could quickly freeze the system when he bounded into my office.  He could press the keys and move the mouse, and the mouse cursor would move.  However, he couldn't actually click on anything or start any programs.  He would grow bored quickly, and leave the computer alone.  I could press the secret control key (F5) to regain control.\r\nI haven't updated this for Vista or Windows 7 when the updated security is on.\r\nFor whatever reason, I can't find the source for the keyboardmouse.dll file, but I have included it in the project.", "shortname": "ethanator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Freezes all keyboard and mouse on any computer", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2113697}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ethanator/", "video_url": null}
