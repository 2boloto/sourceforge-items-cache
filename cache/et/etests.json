It has been developed during a Phd in education at the University of Namur, Belgium.\r\n\r\nTo the students it offers feedback and detailed results to compare with pairs. To teachers it offers a way to analyze questions, validate them, follow the classroom trends of answers, edit questions, surveys, contextualize results regarding to studies sections, period of the year, etc.  \r\n\r\nThis software is actually in pre-alpha because some not essentials features are still missing.\r\n\r\neTests uses several opensources libraries. See the 'Credits' section in the README file.\r\n\r\nThere is no documentation for the moment. It will be done in the wiki as soon as possible.\r\n\r\neTests was presented at FOSDEM 2013 during a lightning talk http://youtu.be/BM0QpD86je0", "shortname": "etests", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/etests.software", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Formative evaluation platform", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 744679}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/etests/", "video_url": ""}
