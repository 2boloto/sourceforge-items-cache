All the inner network details are hidden as well as all the parameters serialization and exception management. \r\n\r\nEach remote method call just works as if it was executed locally.\r\n\r\nYour server side application can setup one or more servers, each one serving on a different network port. Each server is multiplexed, so it can serve many clients at the same time. A server can register one or more services, each one implementing a Java interface. The client uses the Java interface(s) and on-the-fly client-side proxy objects to make all Java method calls.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when a method call finishes, the channel can be left open to perform full duplex streaming between the client and the server.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "etherbuzz", "_id": "55527c84909547203bae4f5c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2461356, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Easy remote Java methods calls with streaming", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
