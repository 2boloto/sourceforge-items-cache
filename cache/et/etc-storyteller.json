Working hard throughout Spring of 2011, the changes to Panda LE are significantly made to make the editor more interactive with new features, while retaining the base editor's functions and feel. For more information, please visit the Storyteller section for more details.\r\n\r\nThe Panda LE project's goal is to build a comprehensive Level Editor for the Panda 3D engine. This level editor is based on the basic level editor developed by Gyedo Jeon at Disney for internal purposes. We will be extending the functionality of Gyedo's level editor to make it more suitable for a larger audience. Our specific target user groups are the BVW Class, NHSGA, and the ETC at large. We hope that after the Panda Community gets a chance to review our code that this level editor will be included in the official Panda release.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this project has been indefinitely postponed.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "etc-storyteller", "_id": "4f60bcb51be1ce56ee0003fa", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 722928, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A quick rapid-prototyping level editor using the Panda3d source code.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
