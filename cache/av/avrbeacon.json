It is mainly used by the hamradio operators to set up various radio beacons for different purposes, mostly for radio waves propagation discoveries.\r\nCW (continious waves, Morze code) is a main modulation mode. Other modes like PSK and FSK are planned to implement in the future releases. User can enter any ASCII text to send it to the air.  Transmission rates and modes are configurable from the input text. AVR beacon can read an external digital instruments like (voltmeter, thermometer, axelerometer, anemometer, etc.) and send its data to the air.\r\nBeacons network is planned to implement using an external GPS module for time syncronization.\r\nThis project runs on Atmel AVR pico-power Mega microcontrollers: ATmega48p, ATmega88p, ATmega168p and ATmega368p. It is possible to port it to other AVR MCUs as well.", "summary": "A hamradio beacon project on an AVR MCU", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 860319, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "avrbeacon", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ur4mck/", "username": "ur4mck", "name": "Dmitry Gorokh"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon.jpg", "caption": "Working prototype in a shielded case and LiPo battery for supply", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon_1.gif", "caption": "Simple beacon schematics", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon_1.gif/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon_2.gif", "caption": "More powerful beacon schematics", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon_2.gif/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon_2_pcb_layer1.gif", "caption": "PCB layer1 photo", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon_2_pcb_layer1.gif/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon_2_pcb_layer2.gif", "caption": "PCB layer2 photo", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/beacon_2_pcb_layer2.gif/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/photo_1.jpg", "caption": "Prototype photo", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avrbeacon/screenshot/photo_1.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "id": 238}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Assembly", "fullname": "Assembly", "shortname": "assembly", "id": 162}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: Ham Radio", "fullname": "Ham Radio", "shortname": "hamradio", "id": 38}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "id": 537}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "fullname": "Testers", "shortname": "testers", "id": 865}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
