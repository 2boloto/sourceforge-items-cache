It is the result of over 15 years of research and development in the evolving science of software vulnerability assessment and exploitation.\r\n\r\nAt its core, AVENGE utilizes a combination of Artificial Intelligence, Neural-Networks, and Machine Learning heuristics to detect vulnerable and exploitable functions and procedures in software  with a high degree of accuracy. In laboratory settings as well as third-party validation experiments, AVENGE has detected exploitable vulnerabilities with an average accuracy rate of over 98%.\r\n\r\nAVENGE detects the presence of vulnerable and exploitable functions and procedures. It is also capable of generating proof of concept code in three varieties: Standalone Executables, Metasploit Modules, and Assembly Language.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "avenge", "_id": "5151fb49485acd3c9bbed6bc", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1434511, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Advanced Vulnerability Exploit Generation Environment", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
