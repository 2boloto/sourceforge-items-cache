It is the result of over 15 years of research and development in the evolving science of software vulnerability assessment and exploitation.\r\n\r\nAt its core, AVENGE utilizes a combination of Artificial Intelligence, Neural-Networks, and Machine Learning heuristics to detect vulnerable and exploitable functions and procedures in software  with a high degree of accuracy. In laboratory settings as well as third-party validation experiments, AVENGE has detected exploitable vulnerabilities with an average accuracy rate of over 98%.\r\n\r\nAVENGE detects the presence of vulnerable and exploitable functions and procedures. It is also capable of generating proof of concept code in three varieties: Standalone Executables, Metasploit Modules, and Assembly Language.", "shortname": "avenge", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Advanced Vulnerability Exploit Generation Environment", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1434511}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/avenge/", "video_url": ""}
