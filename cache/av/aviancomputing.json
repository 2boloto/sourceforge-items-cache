Avian Computing discards the slow and error-prone \"lines of code\" model and replaces it with a new model: flocks of birds. Changing the model to flocks of birds makes it easier to think about and to describe the actions that we want to perform concurrently, which leads to rapid development of working parallel programs.\r\n\r\nThe Avian Computing Environment provides multiple tools to control and modify the behavior of running programs as well as a number of built-in info resources, such as by-thread logging, dynamic presentation of individual thread performance, overall resource levels and more.", "summary": "Develop parallel programs quickly & explore optimum thread configs", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 267658, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bugs"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aviancomputing", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/nchamberlain/", "username": "nchamberlain", "name": "Nelson Chamberlain"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/239166.jpg", "caption": "Info about the food classes for Bird #1", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/239166.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/238852.jpg", "caption": "After lifetimes expire, review events of their lives", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/238852.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/239164.jpg", "caption": "3 Birds (thread) running, progress bars show activity", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/239164.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/239170.jpg", "caption": "Setting name and food types for Bird #1", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/239170.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/239168.jpg", "caption": "Setting life elements for Bird #1", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/aviancomputing/screenshot/239168.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://aviancomputing.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "id": 471}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Eclipse Public License", "fullname": "Eclipse Public License", "shortname": "eclipselicense", "id": 406}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "fullname": "Software Development", "shortname": "development", "id": 45}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Distributed Computing", "fullname": "Distributed Computing", "shortname": "distributed_computing", "id": 308}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
