After completion of test case execution it populates the result in database tables. A report tool fetch the result data from database and produce an HTML report.\r\n\r\nHighlights of this tool\r\n\r\n- No coding effort is required from developer to integrate existing JUnit test cases. They just need to put their test case folder to the class path\r\n\r\n-  Since it keep the test result data in a database, it can keep history of any number of past execution result. This build is bundled with open source embedded database HSQLDB. User may also use other database or their choice  \r\n\r\n- The HTML report can also include previous run results. Number of last run result to include in report is user configurable\r\n\r\n- Flexible and de-coupled design\r\n ", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "junitexecuterreportgenerator", "_id": "53e41d643e5e83760a2780b3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2299381, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}, {"mount_point": "mercurial", "name": "hg", "label": "Mercurial"}], "summary": "Runs JUnit Test cases and generate HTML report, keeps past run history", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Testing", "shortname": "testing", "fullname": "Testing", "id": 575}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Common Public License 1.0", "shortname": "ibmcpl", "fullname": "Common Public License 1.0", "id": 307}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: JDBC", "shortname": "db_api_jdbc", "fullname": "JDBC", "id": 502}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
