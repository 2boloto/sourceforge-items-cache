After completion of test case execution it populates the result in database tables.

They just need to put their test case folder to the class path\r\n\r\n-  Since it keep the test result data in a database, it can keep history of any number of past execution result. This build is bundled with open source embedded database HSQLDB. User may also use other database or their choice  \r\n\r\n- The HTML report can also include previous run results. Number of last run result to include in report is user configurable\r\n\r\n- Flexible and de-coupled design\r\n ", "shortname": "junitexecuterreportgenerator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Runs JUnit Test cases and generate HTML report, keeps past run history", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2299381}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Mercurial", "mount_point": "mercurial", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/junitexecuterreportgenerator/", "video_url": null}
