Simply put, one merely needs to create a new document in Notepad and put a command on each line. Just select or drag that into the program's easy GUI, and in a folder called \"Generated TF2 Configs,\" your configurations will be generated.\r\n\r\nThis folder is CLEARED at each start of the program to ensure your different generations will not get mixed up, so please move them out. This doesn't yet support any type of aliasing, as it is brand new. Just one command per button for now.\r\n\r\nYou MUST retain your original config.360.cfg and simply link to \"config1.cfg\" which is always the name of the first config. Once done, you'll be able to seek through configs numerically, with the Right Shoulder Button incrementing by one and the Left Shoulder Button decrementing by one.\r\n\r\nThis is very new, so I expect some bugs. Please report them as you see them. Hopefully this will turn into a Source Engine Toolkit.", "shortname": "tf2configloop", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Make configuration loops quickly and accurately for modded Xbox games", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1201859}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tf2configloop/", "video_url": ""}
