TFEL mostly includes the MFront code generator.\r\n\r\nMFront is based on C++ and provides several domain specific languages which were designed to simplify the implementations of new material properties, mechanical behaviours and simple material  models.\r\n\r\nA particular focus was made on mechanical behaviours  which are by essence more complex and may have significant impact on the numerical performances of mechanical simulations. Various performance benchmarks show that the code generated using MFront is in most cases on par or better than other implementations, generally written in Fortran.\r\n\r\nFor mechanical behaviours, MFront introduces interfaces which generate code specific to various finite solvers (Cast3M, Code-Aster, ZeBuLoN, etc...\r\n\r\nThe authors hope that it will prove usefull for researchers and engineers, in particular in the field of solid  mechanics.", "shortname": "tfel", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "TFEL/MFront introduces DSLs based on C++ to handle material knowledge", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2335395}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "TFEL", "mount_point": "tfel", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/tfel/", "video_url": null}
