My hobby work for now is to create a very simple to use scripting service like PHP with a few initial useful accessories. The concept of the project is to make the language as simple as it can be and as flexible as required when creating a professional web application. It might not be a surprise that it will be based on MVC, the Model-View-Controller pattern. The MVC pattern takes apart the logical functionality, the user interface and the database controlling. But at the same time, it bonds them together with few communication channel. You can code it in PHP, ASP, etc.. OR you can use this as a built-in, pre-designed tool. Of course, I have several different cool ideas in my pocket, so this will be enough for a little introduction.", "shortname": "umvc", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The micro MVC server-side scripting service", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1906313}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/umvc/", "video_url": ""}
