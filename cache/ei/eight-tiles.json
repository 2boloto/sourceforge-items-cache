Currently, it runs in 2 algorithms, Breadth First Search and Depth First Search. Even if you don't like the current implementation of one of algorithms, you can easily modify it, change it, or even implement and your new preferred algorithms using the game elements. Adding new algorithm will cost you changing about 2 or 3 lines besides your own implementation. Not only run the algorithm, but the interface helps you to show the number of nodes explored by the algorithm and the number of steps it takes to solve the game. You can start from a random solvable state or navigate to a state yourself. The interface animates the actions of solving the state and you can change the delay between each action to be able to track, analyze and learn.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "eight-tiles", "_id": "50b2581f24b0d92b086af166", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1109675, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "The 8-Tiles project is to study, play and analyze the 8-tiles problem.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games", "shortname": "Puzzles", "fullname": "Puzzle Games", "id": 268}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "shortname": "development", "fullname": "Software Development", "id": 45}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "id": 133}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Academic Free License (AFL)", "shortname": "afl", "fullname": "Academic Free License (AFL)", "id": 324}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Educational Community License", "shortname": "educom", "fullname": "Educational Community License", "id": 629}, {"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: .NET/Mono", "shortname": "ui_dotnet", "fullname": ".NET/Mono", "id": 469}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
