You might say that Debian is our mother Gaia. We aim to make her proud as, with the aid of our father C2Eif, we strengthen her inner workings with software contracts. The aim of Eifflix is to replicate Debian, using the contractually based Eiffel language to replace C as the underlying workhorse.  The result should prove to be reliable and maintainable, because the Eiffel language encourages programmers to work within contracts. Contracts strengthen human relations -- examples of contracts are familial, social, business, and political. Contracts likewise strengthen software relations.\r\n\r\nBeginning as a collection of packages, we hope one day to provide a full operating system as stated at http://eifflix.org.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "eifflix", "_id": "5414a4e39095476dc600e44c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2323346, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Packages translated from languages like C into Eiffel", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Object Oriented", "shortname": "swdev_oo", "fullname": "Object Oriented", "id": 562}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: OS distribution", "shortname": "osdistro", "fullname": "OS distribution", "id": 798}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Eiffel", "shortname": "eiffel", "fullname": "Eiffel", "id": 166}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}, {"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: Project is an Operating System Distribution", "shortname": "os_projectdistro", "fullname": "Project is an Operating System Distribution", "id": 438}]}}
