You might say that Debian is our mother Gaia. We aim to make her proud as, with the aid of our father C2Eif, we strengthen her inner workings with software contracts. The aim of Eifflix is to replicate Debian, using the contractually based Eiffel language to replace C as the underlying workhorse.  The result should prove to be reliable and maintainable, because the Eiffel language encourages programmers to work within contracts. Contracts strengthen human relations -- examples of contracts are familial, social, business, and political. Contracts likewise strengthen software relations.\r\n\r\nBeginning as a collection of packages, we hope one day to provide a full operating system as stated at http://eifflix.org.", "shortname": "eifflix", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Packages translated from languages like C into Eiffel", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2323346}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/eifflix/", "video_url": null}
