This stage also will not contain images of each YGO card; rather, words will be substituted for images.\r\n\r\nEstimated time of completion: Mid November\r\n(See the CHANGELOG file)\r\n\r\n2: Fully automated GUI with all actions scheduled and handled by the computer. Users will only have to  select options off of a menu.\r\n\r\n3: Full simulator with images, AI and multi-player (hopefully including LAN, Internet, and local).", "shortname": "ygoduelingsim", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Dueling Simulator for the Yu Gi Oh TCG", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 618763}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ygoduelingsim/", "video_url": ""}
