Its functionality is fairly automobile-oriented, and it cannot accommodate public transit schedule information in its calculations. Furthermore, network datasets that include transit information are difficult to find or create.\r\n\r\nThe General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a recently-developed data format for storing public transit routes, stops, and schedules.  GTFS data is used in Google Maps transit trip planning. Many major public transit systems have made up-to-date GTFS data for their systems readily available for download.\r\n\r\nThis ArcToolbox tool allows Network Analyst to use GTFS data to calculate transit/walking service areas for user-selected times of day and days of the week.
