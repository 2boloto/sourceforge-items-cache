Run any Java class in top center of window by writing javaclass://the.package.ClassName anywhere in a definition, but only if you check the \"allow file to run code\" box. Integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) data structures including bayesaddr (piece of a bayesian network), boltzaddr (piece of a boltzmann machine), listaddr (list of any items in the system including other addr types), and other things you would find in an AI framework, designed for ease of use by anyone. Its about how we think. Version 0.7.0 has issues with square brackets in definitions and Java events, to be fixed soon. Its a framework for research toward general intelligence.
