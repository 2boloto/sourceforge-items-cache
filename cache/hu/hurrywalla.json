HURRy is based on PRoPHET but it incorporates the contact duration to the information retrieved from historical encounters among neighbours. It distinguishes between short and long contacts and introduces a novel and more meaningful rating system to evaluate the quality of each contact in human based deployments.\r\nHurrywalla has been implemented as an evolution of the Bytewalla3 open source project, which is a DTN implementation for Android incorporating PRoPHET. Tecnalia has evolved this work so as to implement the HURRy protocol within the DTN stack. The HURRywalla release also incorporates the Publish/Query paradigm defined by BPQ, which allows dynamic content caching.\r\nThis work has been conducted within the European FP7 SAIL project (Grant Agreement 257448).", "shortname": "hurrywalla", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Android implementation of HURRy and BPQ over Bytewalla for DTN", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "HURRywalla - Code", "mount_point": "hurrywalla", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1286446}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/hurrywalla/", "video_url": ""}
