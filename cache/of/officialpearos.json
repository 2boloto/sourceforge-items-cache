Using our own CIL Compiler, Kernel, and tools we are developing a fast dependent cool and inspiring project. We want to make a very reliable and expandable Operating System in the long run that is slim and does its job well with good security. Our goal, make something like Linux but different. Our code design and how things work is original and we like to write fast and well working code. PearOs has a very strong base, but is not meant for writing code using C#'s standard calls and functions. Instead there are work arounds and certain things that must be followed due to how the compiler was written. The Compiler uses Microsoft's \"IL Disassembler\" tool and can parse CIL files and convert them to Assembly.", "shortname": "officialpearos", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Open Source Operating System", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2059824}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/officialpearos/", "video_url": ""}
