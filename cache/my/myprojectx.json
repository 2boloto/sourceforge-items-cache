You have tasks, notes, events both for yourselves and also for each project - yes, each of them are isolated so that you don't get mixed up with two tasks from different projects. Each project has a 'dropbox' where all your files are stored. Messages are also included within this app, so that you don't rush from one email id to another so as to keep different stuff different. All your mails are grouped under their respective groups,   so no confusion. All this functionality is exposed via an API, so chances are that it may be used to provide accessibility on other devices.", "shortname": "myprojectx", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Yet another task management system, but with lots of exciting features", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 705437}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/myprojectx/", "video_url": ""}
