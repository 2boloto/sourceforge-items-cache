You can increase the effectiveness of your thermal curtains even further by; purchasing a thermal liner that has been treated to block light; and adding an insulated interlining between the curtain fabric and the thermal lining. \r\n\r\nThermal lining is usually made from a heavy duty polyester/cotton blend. It will usually allow some light in depending on how heavy the face fabric of the curtain is. Most thermal linings are also treated to give the panels black-out properties. This is done by heat bonding an acrylic or liquid polymer to the liner fabric.", "shortname": "mycurtainideas", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The Advantages Of Thermal Lined Curtains", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2116389}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mycurtainideas/", "video_url": null}
