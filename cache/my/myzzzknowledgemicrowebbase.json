This is a base which stores knowledge in the form of nested sets, each set can contain a virtually unlimited number of elements and, in turn, each element can contain multiple elements. The access time from multiple ELEMENT NOT DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF ITEMS IN IT AND PRACTICAL instantaneous!\r\n\r\nThe access to knowledge base is realized through a \"server\" to which you can connect an unlimited number of \"clients\" as one computer can run multiple servers that are located in different folders and listen to different ports. Each server can create and access the unlimited knowledge bases and databases associated with other servers located on the Internet or Intranet. Knowledge bases managed by artificial intelligence language, such as executable code can be written as in external files and in the elements of the base. The Knowledge Base is powerful enough, it can be used for indexing web contents.", "shortname": "myzzzknowledgemicrowebbase", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "This is a base which stores knowledge in the form of nested sets", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1934016}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/myzzzknowledgemicrowebbase/", "video_url": ""}
