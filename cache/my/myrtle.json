It provides the standard spreadsheet functionality one would expect like multiple tabbed sheets, relative and absolute row and column referencing in formulas, and a large catalog of built-in functions.  Functions specific to logic and computer science, mathematics, probability, and statistics are available.  Student's can easily create, customize, and update plots and graphical summaries of their analyses.  \r\n\r\nMyrtle offers a unique bookmarking facility which allows students to create and reuse named references to their favorite cell ranges.  This can help students focus attention on the important relationships among particular rows or columns of data.  Myrtle's graphics and reporting features allow students to report back to their instructors their mastery of course content.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "myrtle", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/MockTurtleSolutions", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A simple programmable spreadsheet for learning statistics.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1883717}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Myrtle Help", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/myrtle/", "video_url": ""}
