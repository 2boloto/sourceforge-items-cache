A tool that would not take me more than 60 seconds to log in, generate, and download a new certificate.\r\n\r\n3. A single password to log into the UI and manage multiple CAs.\r\n\r\n4. No dependencies on the PHP OpenSSL extension, no database dependencies, nor other less-commonly-available extensions.\r\n\r\n5.
