It is written in Delphi and uses the GLScene OpenGL library. My 3D Desktop lets you add 3D shortcuts to your favorite applications and/or files as cubes and lets you move them around in 3D. You can also add photos besides a classic wallpaper. The 3D shortcuts and photos can be set to spin around. My 3D Desktop also lets you browse, open, copy/move/delete files and folders on your computer using a 3D text representation of the file structure. There is also a task bar representation of all visible applications in the form of a list of tiles that can be controlled in a similar manner in which you do with the classic Windows taskbar.  You also can preview the application's main window for any progress.", "shortname": "my3ddesktop", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "3D Desktop interface", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 674254}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/my3ddesktop/", "video_url": ""}
