The project a network simulation-based project, on a network simulator, named Glomosim. Glomosim is a C language-based command-line network simulator.

However, I need this project done quite soon. I am really tight on a deadline, so anyone who has ample experience and grasp on network simulation and C Language programming, please please please contact me asap. I am a person in serious need and a genuine customer. Thank you very much to who ever replies to this, in advance.
