The objective of the system is to help the diagnosis process of breast cancer. Breast cancer is one of the major causes of death among women. Small clusters of micro calcifications appearing as collection of white spots on mammograms show an early warning of breast cancer. We compare normal breast tissue with malignant invasive breast tissue by a series of image processing steps. Primary prevention seems impossible since the causes of this disease are still unknown.", "shortname": "bcds", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "System diagnosing breast cancer in mammograms", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 681948}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bcds/", "video_url": ""}
