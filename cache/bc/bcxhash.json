It is thread safe and you can use as many hash tables in your program as you wish because each has its own context. You can drop items from the hash table and can expire items that have become too old. String keys are default, but with your own comparison routine you can use binary or specialty keys. If you have special needs you can substitute your on hash calculation function for the built in one. There is also a library call that allows you to judge the efficiency of your hash function. The library has complete HTML documentation. And several tests of the library can be run with \"make check\".", "shortname": "bcxhash", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "AuthorBCostales", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Thread safe hash library", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2030839}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bcxhash/", "video_url": null}
