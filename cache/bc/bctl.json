It implements a multi-loop circulation/distribution controller targeting a dual boiler system for combined wood/fuel based heating. The wood fired boiler system utilizes hot water thermal storage and indirect heating of domestic hot water during firing. It includes provision for dumping excess heat to the distribution system, as well as provision for heat recovery during a cool-down cycle. \r\n\r\nThe design is based on the 1-wire family of sensors and data I/O components. The software package is written in C++ and utilizes the owcapi and owlib facilities of the open-source owfs package for all 1-wire transactions.\r\n\r\nThe software architecture is based on the QP hierarchical state machine framework developed by Quantum Leaps, and utilizes their QM modeling tool for state machine template generation. QP is an open-source package and QM is distributed free of charge.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bctl", "_id": "5263e1673e5e83093d1e2943", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1984304, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "1-wire based boiler/DHW/distribution heating system controller", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Home Automation", "shortname": "homeauto", "fullname": "Home Automation", "id": 796}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Building Automation", "shortname": "buildingauto", "fullname": "Building Automation", "id": 855}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
