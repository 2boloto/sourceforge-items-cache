After another terrible WordPress experience, I've decided to share my own CMS I use for small projects.\r\n\r\nWhy is it better? It's simple -- you don't need to learn my own special scripting language, shorthand, made up architecture paradigm, quirky notation, or convoluted plug-in system. No more wrangling and kludging just to get a simple task like customizing menus done.\r\n\r\nThe code base is a straight-up Object Oriented business layer with an MVC front-end. Simple, easy to understand objects that make sense, and a clean separation between business and display logic should make it straightforward to customize.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project isn't to provide a product that's all things to all people, but rather to provide a platform that lets you quickly get a project up and running when the requirement is \"CMS with one-or-two other things\". How to extend it should be a matter left up to you, the developer. \r\n\r\nRelease v.1a should be sometime in October.", "shortname": "bcms", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A Better CMS", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 850571}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bcms/", "video_url": ""}
