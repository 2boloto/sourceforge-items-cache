After another terrible WordPress experience, I've decided to share my own CMS I use for small projects.\r\n\r\nWhy is it better? It's simple -- you don't need to learn my own special scripting language, shorthand, made up architecture paradigm, quirky notation, or convoluted plug-in system. No more wrangling and kludging just to get a simple task like customizing menus done.\r\n\r\nThe code base is a straight-up Object Oriented business layer with an MVC front-end. Simple, easy to understand objects that make sense, and a clean separation between business and display logic should make it straightforward to customize.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project isn't to provide a product that's all things to all people, but rather to provide a platform that lets you quickly get a project up and running when the requirement is \"CMS with one-or-two other things\". How to extend it should be a matter left up to you, the developer. \r\n\r\nRelease v.1a should be sometime in October.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bcms", "_id": "5029dd4b1be1ce116dcc5bde", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 850571, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A Better CMS", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
