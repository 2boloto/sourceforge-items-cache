This is at the heart of the \u201cuse case process\u201d that is used to define the requirements for the smart grid.  Use cases define the applications in a way that can be used to determine the specific requirements for communications infrastructure, new technologies, and information integration.  Once filled out, the information in this template is importable into a commercially available CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tool.  Once into this CASE tool, a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams can be created and automatically create the artifacts of the use case process. This project produces tools that can support the import and export of Word-document based Use Case Templates into and from Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect.", "shortname": "ucrepoclientapp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1170739}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ucrepoclientapp/", "video_url": ""}
