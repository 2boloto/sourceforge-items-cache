Please read the .txt file in either the Linux or Windows folders for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nYou may notice the data is pulled from the UCCX server then written to the file system as a .csv file.  I don't like this method but was the only way I could get it to work.  If there is anyone out there who would like to help run the queries in the code instead of shelling out to the OS, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThere is a discussion forum here, please use it for any comments.
