The solution is to\r\nslice or split the file into small pieces (chuncks) and allow for asynchronous call into the server for each slice; \r\nonce this is done, the javascript trigger another call to the server ( ajax) call with some meta data. The fileupload.js file contains pure javasccript \r\ncode with no depenecy on any third part. The code can be configured to change the chunck size. \r\nThe code has NOT been tested on memory limited device; \r\nhowever for any issue and help please report it ", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fileuploadformemorycontraint", "_id": "54e8f27d04161f1364c5e91d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2413814, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "iphone and android has limited memory.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
