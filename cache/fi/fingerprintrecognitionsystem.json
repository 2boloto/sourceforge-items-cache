The fingerprint matching is based on the Euclidean distance between the two corresponding FingerCodes and hence is extremely fast. We are able to achieve a verification accuracy which is only marginally inferior to the best results of minutiae-based algorithms published in the open literature. Our system performs better than a state-of-the-art minutiae-based system when the performance requirement of the application system does not demand a very low false acceptance rate. Finally, we show that the matching performance can be improved by combining the decisions of the matchers based on complementary (minutiae-based and filter-based) fingerprint information.\r\n\r\nIndex Terms: Biometrics, FingerCode, fingerprints, flow pattern, Gabor filters, matching, texture, verification.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fingerprintrecognitionsystem", "_id": "5506a5e781b24b3db353be74", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2427238, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Fingerprint Recognition System 5.3 - Matlab source code", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics", "shortname": "mathematics", "fullname": "Mathematics", "id": 98}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Human Machine Interfaces", "shortname": "HMI", "fullname": "Human Machine Interfaces", "id": 272}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence :: Machine Learning", "shortname": "machinelearning", "fullname": "Machine Learning", "id": 802}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other License", "id": 196}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
