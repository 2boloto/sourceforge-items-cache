Popping noises mainly when going from silence to sound and vice versa.\r\n2. Tiny extra silence when going from silence to sound that cuts the beginning of songs and sound effects.\r\n\r\n# How does this tool help me fix that?\r\n\r\nActually this is not a fix, but a way to overcome those problems by tricking the device into keeping a playing state forever. It constantly loops a wave file in background containing just silence (FF hex values). That way it manages to keep the device always active but without making any real sound at all.\r\n\r\n# But won't this break my Fiio E10?\r\n\r\nI have no idea!
