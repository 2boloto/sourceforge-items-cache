I did everything wrong the first time, and decided to started over from scratch .\r\nI began that adventure on Sunday October 26,2014. I changed everything, theme, the plug-in's, everything. \r\nI switched from StartupWpPro to Woocommerce. StartupWpPro did not give me what I wanted for a website. Great package though at a great price.\r\nAfter looking at what was available I decided Woocommerce was the way to go. They have exactly what I am looking for.\r\nI have the website partially setup. Will complete setup after I finish sorting all the material I have.
