It is suitable for applications that require manual control of vehicles, telemetry and a secure two way datalink. It supports 256bit AES encryption. \r\n\r\nThe FireLink API transparently provides state information (such as heading, ground speed ect) as well as several built in commands (arm motor, switch autopilot mode, etc). Additional user defined commands can be easily implemented. \r\n\r\nThe API is written in C++ and has no dependancies. It will run on any platform that supports C++ including Arduino.
