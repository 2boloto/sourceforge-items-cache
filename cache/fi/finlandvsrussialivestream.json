While Canada, Sweden and the United States will get decidedly more cushy quarterfinal matchups against lesser opponents, the Russians will square off with a Finnish team that could very well beat them.\r\n\r\nThe Finns are a stingy defensive team that could drive Russia up a wall with their structure in their own zone. Finland has no problem playing a patient and cautious game. They can wait it out, and pounce at the first sign of a defensive breakdown for Russia.\r\n\r\nThat could cause issues for players like Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin, who thrive in wide open games. They haven\u2019t seen a lot of space in this tournament so far though, and they won\u2019t be given any quarter by a chippy Finnish team that is looking to advance despite missing several key players.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "finlandvsrussialivestream", "_id": "53049a287929e50799d1dfef", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2105909, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
