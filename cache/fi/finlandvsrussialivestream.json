While Canada, Sweden and the United States will get decidedly more cushy quarterfinal matchups against lesser opponents, the Russians will square off with a Finnish team that could very well beat them.\r\n\r\nThe Finns are a stingy defensive team that could drive Russia up a wall with their structure in their own zone. Finland has no problem playing a patient and cautious game. They can wait it out, and pounce at the first sign of a defensive breakdown for Russia.\r\n\r\nThat could cause issues for players like Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin, who thrive in wide open games. They haven\u2019t seen a lot of space in this tournament so far though, and they won\u2019t be given any quarter by a chippy Finnish team that is looking to advance despite missing several key players.", "shortname": "finlandvsrussialivestream", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2105909}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/finlandvsrussialivestream/", "video_url": null}
