Conversely, there is no one program that is better than everything else. They all have their merits. It's good to go and see what you get from different programs and use your own experience to further define how you stay fit as time goes on.\r\n\r\nIf you resolve to keep trying new things, remain determined to learn more and more, you will build motivation. You won't get discourage over time. Instead you drive will get stronger and stronger just as your body is doing the same. Fitness is a lifelong journey that is sure to keep giving back to you.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fibrolief", "_id": "540e960004161f7f8ecf7ec0", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2320338, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
