Even for those administrators who need to deploy Firefox on hundreds of network computers will find it a cumbersome task to do it manually. To assist you in building a silent Firefox installer with all of the settings preset, here is FFaM, aka Firefox Addon Maker.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an application written in C# that will create a silent installer. The installer can be created in Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7, 32-bit or 64-bit. The installers can be installed in Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7, 32-bit or 64-bit. You can create an installer with all of your settings intact, an installer with no modifications. Or, anything in between. You can create an installer from one of the three versions posted by Mozilla, the Current version, the Previous version and the Beta version.\r\n", "shortname": "firefoxaddonmak", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Firefox Addon Maker", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 287906}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Feature Requests", "mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/firefoxaddonmak/", "video_url": ""}
