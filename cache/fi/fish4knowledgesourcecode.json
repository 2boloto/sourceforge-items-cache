A combination of computer vision, database storage, workflow and human computer interaction methods were used to achieve this.\r\n\r\nThe project used live video feeds from 10 underwater cameras as a testbed for investigating more generally applicable methods for capture, storage, analysis and querying of multiple video streams. We collated a public database from 3 years containing video summaries of the observed fish and associated descriptors. Expert web-based interfaces were developed for use by marine researchers, allowing unprecedented access to live and previously stored videos, or previously extracted information.", "shortname": "fish4knowledgesourcecode", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Analysis of undersea fish videos", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1945404}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fish4knowledgesourcecode/", "video_url": ""}
