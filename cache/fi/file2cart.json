It supports 34 popular shopping carts. The service provides accurate one-time or scheduled data import. With a scheduled import option a user can update shopping cart database regularly, modifying the products or add new items. There are fixed plans depending on the quantity of products imported per month - basic plan (10 000 items), standard plan (25 000), premium plan (50 000). Additional package is also available. A user can order cutomized import to meet different store configurations. The assisted import saves your time and efforts as the whole import procedure is performed by File2Cart programmers. The deadlines of import depend on import priority and vary from 3 days (standard priority) to 24 hours (high priority). The prices are flexible and can be estimated individually on the file2Cart official site.
