It allows you to manipulate files and folders in a similar way with the native Windows Explorer. As an extra feature it lets you easily see the size of a file or folder by middle clicking its 3D object. Another extra feature is the group selection which allows you to group together files and folders from different locations and copy/move/delete them.\r\n\r\nExplorer 3D also has a \"task bar\" representation for all running applications, each 3D object representing one running application displaying it's title and memory usage just like in Windows Task Manager. Middle click on such object previews the application's main window's contents.\r\n\r\nExplorer 3D is written in Delphi and uses the GLScene OpenGL library", "shortname": "fileexplorer3d", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "File Explorer 3D", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 674318}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fileexplorer3d/", "video_url": ""}
