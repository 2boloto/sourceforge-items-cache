While the average genome coverage is frequently used within algorithms in computational\r\ngenomics, the complete information available in coverage profiles (i.e. histograms over all coverages) is currently not exploited to its full extent. Thus, biases such as fragmented or erroneous reference\r\ngenomes often remain unaccounted for. Making this information accessible can improve the quality of sequencing experiments and quantitative analyses.\r\n\r\nfitGCP is a framework for fitting mixtures of probability distributions to genome coverage profiles. Besides commonly used distributions, fitGCP uses distributions tailored to account for\r\ncommon artifacts. The mixture models are iteratively fitted based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm.\r\n\r\nPlease find the accompanying paper here:\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt147", "shortname": "fitgcp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Fitting genome coverage distributions with mixture models", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1258960}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fitgcp/", "video_url": ""}
