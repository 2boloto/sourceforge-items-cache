It allows a process and all its descendants to have their own private view of the globally shared kernel resources, such as the network stack, process table, mount table.\r\n\r\nFirejail can sandbox any type of processes: servers, graphical applications, and even user login sessions. Written in C with virtually no dependencies, it should work on any Linux computer with a 3.x kernel version.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "firejail", "_id": "53108b269095476e1f5af3a3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2118207, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Linux namespaces sandbox program", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
