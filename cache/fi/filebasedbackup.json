It can do full and incremental backups.\r\nIt will take a directory as input, and will back up the files in that folder and all sub-folders to the backup destination directory.\r\nIt can compress each file individually while backing-up.\r\nMirrors the source directory structure under the target directory. Creates 1 archive file for each source file. Even if the backup/restore program or backup database is not available or lost, the backup files and structure can still be recovered. Huge plus for reliability.\r\nUses a SQL database to manage backup file information. The files are managed through their checksum (SHA256).\r\n\r\nSee wiki page for additional information:\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/filebasedbackup/wiki/Home/\r\n\r\nThe project is work in progress.
