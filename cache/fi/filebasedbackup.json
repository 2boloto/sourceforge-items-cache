It can do full and incremental backups.\r\nIt will take a directory as input, and will back up the files in that folder and all sub-folders to the backup destination directory.\r\nIt can compress each file individually while backing-up.\r\nMirrors the source directory structure under the target directory. Creates 1 archive file for each source file. Even if the backup/restore program or backup database is not available or lost, the backup files and structure can still be recovered. Huge plus for reliability.\r\nUses a SQL database to manage backup file information. The files are managed through their checksum (SHA256).\r\n\r\nSee wiki page for additional information:\r\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/filebasedbackup/wiki/Home/\r\n\r\nThe project is work in progress. Main backup script is functional, but i have taken a break from adding features to the main program to build a GUI in Tkinter.", "shortname": "filebasedbackup", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Content Based File level Data Backup in Python", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2200634}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/filebasedbackup/", "video_url": null}
