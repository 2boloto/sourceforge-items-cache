For some that might be a perfectly acceptable solution, but there is a lot more to controlling data than just moving it between storage tires.\r\n\r\nOne of the main requirements should be able to search and locate the file in question reasonably quickly, with staff turnover, the location of data may be forgotten and organizations may spend considerable time and efforts locating the file or document. A file that cannot be located might as well have been lost forever. Then there is employee productivity, where there is a large volume of information to manage e-discovery becomes ever more important.\r\nLet\u2019s look at a few other features important in managing data and storage. \r\n1. Data Analysis\r\n2. Policy defined archiving\r\n3. E-discovery\r\n4. End user Search and retrieve\r\n5.
