It differs from general OS file search engines in that it personalizes the indexing setup so that users can choose which directories to index or remove from an existing index and it can also suggest queries just like Google's \"Did you mean\" feature. The customization of indexing and query suggestion greatly improves search speed and make user experience more comfortable. eLibrary can also extract text content from files of many wildly used file types such as pdf, doc, ppt, and mp3 to improve the index quality.
