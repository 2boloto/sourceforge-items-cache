Our pack is composed of a video projector, an external controller, a sound card and our software HeavyM. This software manages the audio analysis and extract the main components of music. These components are then sent to the \"video renderer\" that can associate them with different effects such as segmentation of faces, color change, rotation opposite edges of ignition. The artist can interact in real time and at any time during the delivery, with the software to change the effects.\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "elvam", "_id": "4f8c38aab9363c766b000bec", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 749803, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "ELVAM is a package allowing artists to practice video-mapping", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics :: 3D Rendering", "shortname": "3drendering", "fullname": "3D Rendering", "id": 110}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a remote control application", "shortname": "ui_meta_remotecontrol", "fullname": "Project is a remote control application", "id": 468}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other Audience", "id": 5}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: French", "shortname": "french", "fullname": "French", "id": 276}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: Classic 8-bit Operating Systems (Apple, Atari, Commodore, etc.)", "shortname": "eightbit_oses", "fullname": "Classic 8-bit Operating Systems (Apple, Atari, Commodore, etc.)", "id": 449}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
