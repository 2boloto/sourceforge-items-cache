These components are then sent to the \"video renderer\" that can associate them with different effects such as segmentation of faces, color change, rotation opposite edges of ignition. The artist can interact in real time and at any time during the delivery, with the software to change the effects.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "elvam", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "ELVAM is a package allowing artists to practice video-mapping", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 749803}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/elvam/", "video_url": ""}
