The reason is to make it easy to follow the structure and logic of the original php code, and to fix bugs and provide maintenance changes synchronously with the original Studio-42 code\r\n (4) will currently NOT include any additional functionalities beside the original Studio-42 code.\r\n (5) Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in taking part in the translation process or if in future you would like to adapt the code to python web frameworks other then web2py.\r\n\r\nThanks", "shortname": "elfinder20forpython", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "elFinder 2.0 for python 2.7 and web2py", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1938577}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/elfinder20forpython/", "video_url": ""}
