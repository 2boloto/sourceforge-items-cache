Players are randomly placed on a grid.  Players move randomly on the board and engage each other in combat.  When a player loses an engagement, its strength goes down.   \r\n\r\nPlayers display different behavior depending on their characteristics and their current strength levels.  As a player's health ebbs away, it's behavior will change from engaging to running away.  \r\n\r\nIf both players seek to evade combat, because they are low on strength, one of the two players will be penalized. \r\n\r\nThere can be only one - the game completes when there is only a single player remaining and all other players have been vanquished (or when the game hits the maximum number of iterations).\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "elise1-simplegame", "_id": "51fbde27b9363c08ee54d9c6", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1923034, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
