This project uses known advection to transport large-scale magnetic fields across the solar surface, from the origins of the field in sunspot regions, to their demise when opposite field signs (inward and outward directed) come close together whereby the field-lines collapse into the solar interior or outward from the Sun's surface. The latter may lead to a coronal mass ejection. We use a number of other field motions described in a recent paper. These include field \"flocking\", tensions associated with the Babcock-Leighton magnetic field, as well as the Coriolis force, etc.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "solfieldmapping", "_id": "507f0c781be1ce7424b6e81c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1034230, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Maps the changing magnetic fields on the solar surface", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
