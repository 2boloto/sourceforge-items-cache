The entire intention is to be as low-impact to a project as possible. If only 1 object in a project is SOOJS and nothing else is, that is perfectly fine. \r\n\r\nThe power comes from not polluting and allowing all other Javascript paradigms to be possible. In fact, there is nothing you need to download. As a true pattern you just learn it and apply it.\r\n\r\nHosted here are some file templates which help you start new \"classes\" and a module with very very few helper methods that have NO MAGIC in them at all.\r\n\r\nThis is not magic, it's better.
