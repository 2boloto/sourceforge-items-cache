Despite its name, the program is a resequencing utility that can assemble consensus sequence for the genome of a newly sequenced individual based on the alignment of the raw sequencing reads on the known reference. The SNPs can then be identified on the consensus sequence through the comparison with the reference. In the first Asian genome re-sequencing project, evalution of SOAPsnp result on Illumina HapMap 1M BeadChip Duo genotyping sites shows great accuracy. Over 99% of the genotyping sites are covered at over 99.9% consistency. Further PCR plus Sanger sequencing of the inconsistent SNP sites confirmed majority of the SOAPsnp results.", "shortname": "soapsnp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Soapsnp in house version, multi-thread and bam format supported.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1088713}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/soapsnp/", "video_url": ""}
