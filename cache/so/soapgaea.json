It surpasses the performance of currently available alignment software by aggregating their advanced functionalities into a unified cloud-based solution. Due to the internal Hadoop infrastructure, intermediated results from different software algorithms can be efficiently organized and returned. Thus, it is easy to use Gaea for developing different customized, scalable analysis pipelines corresponding to the needs of specific research problems in different domains.", "shortname": "soapgaea", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Gaea is designed for re-sequencing tasks.
