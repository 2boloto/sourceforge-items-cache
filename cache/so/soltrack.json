The code can be used to track the Sun on low-specs machine, such as a PLC or a microcontroller, and can be used for e.g. (highly) concentrated (photovoltaic) solar power. SolTrack has been developed by Marc van der Sluys, Paul van Kan and Jurgen Reintjes, of the Lectorate of Sustainable Energy at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Arnhem, The Netherlands.
