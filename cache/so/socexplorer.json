We write this software for the development and the validation of our instrument, the Low Frequency Receiver(LFR) for the Solar Orbiter mission. This instrument is based on an actel FPGA hosting a LEON3FT processor and some peripherals. To make it more collaborative, we use a plugin based system, the main executable is SocExplorer then all the functionality are provided by plugins. Like this everybody can provide his set of plugins to handle a new SOC or just a new peripheral. SocExplorer uses PythonQt to allow user to automate some tasks such as loading some plugins, configuring them and talking with his device.
