In our framework, we first define a set of image features based on artistic concepts; then a SOM-based hierarchical model is used to analyzing features extracted from individual artists\u2019 painting collections. For our experiment, we obtain painting collections of six artists representing three art movements: post-impressionism, cubism and renaissance. Through our experimental results, artistic styles of different painting collections and their influential relationships can be analyzed and visualized.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use  the \"large painting dataset\" or the \"very first\" version of our feature extraction code, please cite the following publications properly:\r\n Florence Ying Wang and Masahiro Takatsuka.
