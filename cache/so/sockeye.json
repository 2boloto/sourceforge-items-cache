Currently the parser only builds an AST and is on hold, and currently the std lib is what is under development.  This is pre-alpha since it's primarily a library and a bunch of unit tests.  In the near future it could at least be used as a C library for folks who wanted to do operations on Strings, RegExps, Lists, and HashTables which are simple in python.  When I get back to the compiler generating code I'll handle generics so Lists don't just contain void *s.", "shortname": "sockeye", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "An compiled object oriented language which uses the C ABI", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 724137}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sockeye/", "video_url": ""}
