The client feature of Socketer can connect to hosts on the network on different ports and send data and also receieve data.", "shortname": "socketer", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A simple socket debugging tool.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 925473}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketer/", "video_url": ""}
