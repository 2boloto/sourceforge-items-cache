In this paper, the pendulum framework is considered as the method to develop a system or software or project to maintain its dynamic flow. The pendulum is predominantly to pull a sphere with balanced string. The spheres in the following pages considered as the process to maintain the development. To maintain other similarities, the string of each sphere is considered as the schedule, and the foundation bars are coined three portions: one is the developer\u2019s side, both side leader, and finally the client side. The length of the pulling the sphere is stress of providing the product or service to the client. The pendulum, therefore, proposes the foundation of a sophisticated system. The con is: this designed architecture will panic to compile the large task at the same time. Identically, this paper is metrical to the development team who seek for dynamic movement in development.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "softwaredev", "_id": "51c9bd9d81b24b631255a1d0", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1885535, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "Newton's Pendulum in  System-Project-Software development", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
