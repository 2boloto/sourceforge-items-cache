Fallback output is available via sine/saw/triangle/square wave synthesis. Math-based synthesis is planned to evolve over time to support most of the features found in a minimoog voyager, and wavetable based sf2 support is expected to evolve to properly emulate all the features of a roland sc88 (but not there yet).\r\n\r\nAdditionally there are issues with some sf2 files, but currently most development in the git tree has happened with one you can find via google search called Scc1t2.sf2.
