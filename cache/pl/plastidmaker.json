It could be used with other targets, such as specific genes, or transcriptomes, even though that is not it's primary goal, nor thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\nAfter various attempts to build different mitochondrial genomes in the lab I studied, a general pipeline started to appear: assemble reads with MIRA or SOAPdenovo-Trans, look for a scaffold/contig that matches a closely-related species, check it to see if all expected genomic features are present (since mitochondria is well conserved), check to see if the assembly might have circularized (since it's a circular DNA). If a feature was missing, or it hasn't circularized, try and assemble again with different assembler parameters (mainly k-mer). Rinse and repeat until the best build is found.", "shortname": "plastidmaker", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "mitoMaker - a mitochondria pipeline wrapper script", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2232145}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/plastidmaker/", "video_url": null}
