The source for all these changes is hosted here, with the agreement of the original author, Jonathan Duddington, to who thanks are due.\r\n \r\nFor details of all updates from v3.06b to the very latest version, please see the Pluto Web Site (http://www.avisoft.f9.co.uk/pluto/).", "shortname": "plutoemail", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Email reader for RISC OS operating system.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1512963}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/plutoemail/", "video_url": null}
