It's purpose is for cafeteria workers to know how many of each type of lunch to make on a given day.  \r\n\r\nThe process is simple:  In the morning, teachers ask their students what they want to eat.  For example, they count how many students want the main lunch, how many want peanut butter and jelly, or how many want an alternate option.  The teacher then submits these numbers into the software and it automatically calculates totals for the kitchen staff.  \r\n\r\nAll options are customizable.  Different types of lunch categories, groups to separate different lunch periods, and different levels of access for administrators, kitchen staff, and a basic entry page for teachers.
