A video tutorial guides you through the full functionality of this app which, once downloaded, forms a self-contained package packed with useful engineering applications. Wherever you are - even out in the field - LUCID/mercury lets you explore and analyse an array of structural engineering problems.\r\n\r\nAt its core is the ability to import, view, edit solve and post-process simple models. These models are either pre-designed or you can even import your own based on industry standard file formats. You can also create a layout fior a structure based on a preliminary design, as well as performing section property calculations and laminate stuiffness analaysis - all with visual and data outputs.\r\n\r\nAble to read industry standard NASTRAN files, the app benefits from powerful graphics which allow you to fully rotate and enlarg", "shortname": "lucidiron", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Engineering structural analysis app for education", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1759014}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lucidiron/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/s3OrPxxDG8M?rel=0"}
