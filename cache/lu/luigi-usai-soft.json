These are very, very, very easy to learn scripts in batch programming, or if you like, \".bat\" files, which can help those who don't know how to program a computer, how to automate tasks in a Window Based working environement. This files are programmed using the Italian language structure, so they may appear strange to non-italian speakers. I'm going to translate them into other languages, as far as I can, but they'll always be incomplete, without help from mothertongues. Many programmers will laugh at this project, because it's intended not to good users, but to students or children. If some expert would like to collaborate to improve the system, we'd be really glad, but remember the main perspective: teaching. Luigi Usai is a writer and an Italian philosopher. You can find his books online.\r\n\r\nPeace and Love to all Human Beings", "shortname": "luigi-usai-soft", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Luigi-Usai/503785729674752", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Bat - Dos tool to reconfigure your computer Windows Based", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 653874}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/luigi-usai-soft/", "video_url": ""}
