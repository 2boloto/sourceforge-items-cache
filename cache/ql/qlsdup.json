So for files which don't start to differ by growing at the tail it reduces read operations greatly compared to hash-based comparision (i.e. test case: 40GB of files, 16GB RAM, many differences: initial compare (uncached by OS) around 300sec, subsequent compare (relevant file parts cached by OS) ca. 2sec)\r\n\r\nNote: this program is not related to lsdup", "shortname": "qlsdup", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "GUI based lightweight duplicate file finder / remover.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1905750}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "svn_code", "mount_point": "svn_code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/qlsdup/", "video_url": ""}
