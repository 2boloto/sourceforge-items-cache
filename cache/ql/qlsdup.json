Configurable file search and preview (via external tools) option for file data. No command-line interface available!\r\n\r\nThis is basically a reimplementation of dupfinder as: it doesn't compile on my computer, the executable won't work either, the projects seems dead and I didn't wanna work through the original code. So Look'n'Feel should be somewhat the same, though some changes have been made.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm is simple and suitable for large file sets with few differences: basic set of duplicate candidates is determined by file size, then candidates are compared byte-wise. So for files which don't start to differ by growing at the tail it reduces read operations greatly compared to hash-based comparision (i.e. test case: 40GB of files, 16GB RAM, many differences: initial compare (uncached by OS) around 300sec, subsequent compare (relevant file parts cached by OS) ca. 2sec)\r\n\r\nNote: this program is not related to lsdup", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "qlsdup", "_id": "51efe97ff1fd8d01411fcb94", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1905750, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "svn_code", "name": "svn", "label": "svn_code"}], "summary": "GUI based lightweight duplicate file finder / remover.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: File Management", "shortname": "file_management", "fullname": "File Management", "id": 601}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "fullname": "Qt", "id": 479}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "id": 202}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
