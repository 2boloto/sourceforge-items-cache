Our main goal is to define an API that we can use embedded into any Java application to support dynamic execution based on variant flows. The variants are controlled by a graph decision using features diagrams relationships.\r\n\r\nThe project was originally planned in 2005 to support Model Driven Architecture OMG approach, focusing specially on the management of architectural changes and models transformers. The main goal of the program is to design transformation chains based on features diagram variants. The model transformers orchestration is obtained by using Features Diagrams  and Transformation Diagrams (a feature that must be re-implemented to support of a Java drawing API). Any help is welcome. \r\n\r\nGiven that we have some good results in running dynamic transformation chains, we decided to extend the tool to support another goal: a Java API to support variant based program's execution.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it.", "shortname": "adapitwct", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Support variant based Java program execution, adapted to support MDE.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 386481}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adapitwct/", "video_url": ""}
