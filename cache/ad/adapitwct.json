Our main goal is to define an API that we can use embedded into any Java application to support dynamic execution based on variant flows. The variants are controlled by a graph decision using features diagrams relationships.\r\n\r\nThe project was originally planned in 2005 to support Model Driven Architecture OMG approach, focusing specially on the management of architectural changes and models transformers. The main goal of the program is to design transformation chains based on features diagram variants. The model transformers orchestration is obtained by using Features Diagrams  and Transformation Diagrams (a feature that must be re-implemented to support of a Java drawing API). Any help is welcome. \r\n\r\nGiven that we have some good results in running dynamic transformation chains, we decided to extend the tool to support another goal: a Java API to support variant based program's execution.\r\n\r\nEnjoy it.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "adapitwct", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/fabiopbasso/", "username": "fabiopbasso", "name": "F\u00e1bio Paulo Basso"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/andrerpaulon/", "username": "andrerpaulon", "name": "Andre "}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rmpillat/", "username": "rmpillat", "name": "Raquel Pillat"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://adapitwct.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "id": 471}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache License V2.0", "fullname": "Apache License V2.0", "shortname": "apache2", "id": 401}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Code Generators", "fullname": "Code Generators", "shortname": "codegen", "id": 259}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: CASE", "fullname": "CASE", "shortname": "case_tools", "id": 570}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: Brazilian Portuguese", "fullname": "Brazilian Portuguese", "shortname": "portuguesebrazilian", "id": 381}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}]}}
