For doing so backup the folder Android of the sdcards.\r\nCreating a backup with -shared flag has know issues (corruption) so is not recommended. Future releases of this script may add the option to automatically detect things from sdcards inside the adb backup file.\r\n\r\nThis script works on Cygwin also, and in general where star does.\r\n\r\napk-missing.html is generated when apks are missing.\r\n\r\nOther software is needed.
