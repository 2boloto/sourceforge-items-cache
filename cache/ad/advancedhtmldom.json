If you use file/str_get_html then you don't need to change anything. If you are instantiating with `new simple_html_dom()` then you will need to change that to `new AdvancedHtmlDom()`\r\n\r\n*What's Different* - Mostly just formatting (spaces) in the html. This is added by DOM and there's no way around it. Some non-standard selectors have been dropped but many more standard ones have been added. For example: `img[src!=foo]` was removed because it's not a valid selector. Added are things like `a + b` and `a ~ b` or even `a.foo:not(.bar)`\r\n\r\n*What's Better*\r\n- 10x-20x Performance increase\r\n- Reduced memory requirement\r\n- Support for many more css selectors\r\n\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "advancedhtmldom", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A drop-in replacement for simple html dom", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2103661}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/advancedhtmldom/", "video_url": null}
