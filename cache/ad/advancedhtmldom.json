If you use file/str_get_html then you don't need to change anything. If you are instantiating with `new simple_html_dom()` then you will need to change that to `new AdvancedHtmlDom()`\r\n\r\n*What's Different* - Mostly just formatting (spaces) in the html. This is added by DOM and there's no way around it. Some non-standard selectors have been dropped but many more standard ones have been added. For example: `img[src!=foo]` was removed because it's not a valid selector. Added are things like `a + b` and `a ~ b` or even `a.foo:not(.bar)`\r\n\r\n*What's Better*\r\n- 10x-20x Performance increase\r\n- Reduced memory requirement\r\n- Support for many more css selectors\r\n\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "advancedhtmldom", "_id": "53016d05b9363c768d6eded6", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2103661, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "A drop-in replacement for simple html dom", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Formats and Protocols :: Data Formats :: HTML/XHTML", "shortname": "html_xhtml", "fullname": "HTML/XHTML", "id": 556}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Object Oriented", "shortname": "swdev_oo", "fullname": "Object Oriented", "id": 562}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "shortname": "php", "fullname": "PHP", "id": 183}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
