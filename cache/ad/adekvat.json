Blink was a popular Norwegian social netork in the early 2000's before the main coder switched job to VG. then he coded Nettby, wich was an even more successful Social Website. however, when that went lost, a kid tried to clone it with some success, called it \"skybyen\", based on a joomla installation. he then changed the name of the social network to \"decate\" as he totally rewrote it from start using a PHP framework, however it lacked loads of nettbys functions, and it has stopped getting updates. Now i wanna Clone decate, write it in some framework, then add the missing functions from nettby wich was very popular, and add a list of several features, that decate promised, but never released. i also want to create some new one, some inventive features, maybe not seen so often on the web.", "summary": "a social network", "tools": [{"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 889225, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "adekvat", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rhilostudios/", "username": "rhilostudios", "name": "Rhilostudios"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://adekvat-project.org", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
