Doing this can almost eliminate the possibility of getting viruses, malware, or other junk on the computer. This comes at a price though since the Windows system doesn't have an \"su\" command like the Unix/Linux OS does*. Because of this, a user not logged in as the administrator will need to log out of the machine and then back in as the administrator to do upgrades, installs, etc.\r\n\r\nAdmin Console removes this step, by creating a \"workspace\" that runs with alternate credentials. The console allows the user to create shortcuts to applications which will run with whatever credentials are supplied.\r\n\r\n* Although RunAs exists, it doesn't always work as expected.", "summary": "", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 269826, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "adminconsole", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rabbid10/", "username": "rabbid10", "name": "Scott"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adminconsole/screenshot/317761.jpg", "caption": "1 - Main Interface", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adminconsole/screenshot/317761.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adminconsole/screenshot/317765.jpg", "caption": "3 - Add Application", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adminconsole/screenshot/317765.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adminconsole/screenshot/317763.jpg", "caption": "2 - Login Box", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adminconsole/screenshot/317763.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://adminconsole.sourceforge.net/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: .NET/Mono", "fullname": ".NET/Mono", "shortname": "ui_dotnet", "id": 469}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "fullname": "C#", "shortname": "csharp", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: System Shells", "fullname": "System Shells", "shortname": "shells", "id": 294}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "id": 253}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}]}}
