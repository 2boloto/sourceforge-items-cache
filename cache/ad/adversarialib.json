It comes with a set of powerful features: **Easy-to-use**: Running sophisticated experiments is as easy as launch a single script. **Wide range of supported ML algorithms** All supervised learning algorithms supported by scikit-learn, as well as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) **Fast Learning and Evaluation** Thanks to scikit-learn and FANN, all supported ML algorithms are optimized and written in C/C++ language. **Built-in attack algorithms** Gradient Descent Attack **Extensible** Other attack algorithms can be easily added to the library. **Multi-processing** Do you want to further save time? The built-in attack algorithms can run concurrently on multiple processors.\r\nLast, but not least, AdversariaLib is **free software**, released under the GNU General Public License version 3!", "summary": "", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1922426, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "adversarialib", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/freezebat/", "username": "freezebat", "name": "Battista Biggio"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/igiguitar/", "username": "igiguitar", "name": "Igino Corona"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adversarialib/screenshot/biggio-ecmlpkdd13-teaser-250x163.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adversarialib/screenshot/biggio-ecmlpkdd13-teaser-250x163.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adversarialib/screenshot/digits.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adversarialib/screenshot/digits.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adversarialib/screenshot/attack.png", "caption": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adversarialib/screenshot/attack.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://pralab.diee.unica.it/en/AdversariaLib", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
