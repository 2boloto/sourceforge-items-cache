This technology has been developed and now in use in adder Hill air to water generators also known as Adder Hill atmospheric water generators. This technology converts the water in the air into portable water. In other words it can produce water out of thin air.\r\n\r\nThis revolutionary technology is helping to meet the growing demand for economical, good tasting and quality drinking water.\r\n\r\nAdder Hill Machine is a green friendly, alternative water source, for anyone who wishes to maintain control over their own pure water supply. The dew points has been designed to perform at optimum levels, producing high quality water while consuming minimal electricity.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "adderhillmachinetechnology", "_id": "5529008585540d0e55a4c48d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2443656, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
