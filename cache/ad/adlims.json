Our laboratory exploits PCR techniques and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, to perform high-throughput integration site monitoring in different clinical trials and scientific projects, based on the delivery of therapeutic genes by viral vectors integrating into the genome of target cells. We process around 1500 samples/year resulting in hundreds of millions of sequencing reads, requiring automation and posing new challenges in data storage, monitoring of sample process and computational tools for analyses. Thus we need to standardize data management and tracking systems, built on a scalable, flexible structure with an easily accessible and web based interface, what is usually called Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).", "summary": "adLIMS: a Laboratory Information Management System with ADempiere", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2154409, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "adlims", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/spinozzi/", "username": "spinozzi", "name": "spinozzi.giulio"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adlims/screenshot/uses2.jpg", "caption": "adLIMS' Workflow", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adlims/screenshot/uses2.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adlims/screenshot/Workflow.jpg", "caption": "adLIMS' use cases", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adlims/screenshot/Workflow.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adlims/screenshot/adlims.png", "caption": "logo", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adlims/screenshot/adlims.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java AWT", "fullname": "Java AWT", "shortname": "ui_awt", "id": 470}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PL/SQL", "fullname": "PL/SQL", "shortname": "plsql", "id": 254}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "id": 15}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "fullname": "PostgreSQL (pgsql)", "shortname": "db_net_pgsql", "id": 525}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise :: ERP", "fullname": "ERP", "shortname": "erp", "id": 577}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Molecular Science", "fullname": "Molecular Science", "shortname": "molecular_science", "id": 609}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "id": 252}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Healthcare Industry", "fullname": "Healthcare Industry", "shortname": "healthcareindustry", "id": 362}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
