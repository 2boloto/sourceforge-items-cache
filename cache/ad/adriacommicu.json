No costly security certificates are required while ICU Collaboration drills through the Internet to create Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). When used for presentations, the presenter remains in charge of all the tools associated with ICU Collaboration thus using fewer resources and requiring less bandwidth. However, the same high level of security is maintained for both presentations and meetings. No snoopers allowed with ICU Collaboration.
