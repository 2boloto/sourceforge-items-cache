Record matching software try to solve this by machine learning techniques. To do this effectively, its necessary to train the record matcher with proper test data which is identical to real life data. Hence, there is a need for a data generator to create the synthetic data to be used for evaluating the quality and capability of record matching software. \r\n\r\nA data generator creates qualitative test data considering various the real life data glitches entered through various means like human data entry, voice dictation and data scanning. The data generation process is done in many steps like org data creation, data grouping, pair generation, data mutation and matching data patterns. Data generator also mangles field values of generated test data to achieve data errors and co-relate them in real life contexts like Family, Households, Organizations etc", "summary": "A tool to generate synthetic test data useful to Record matchers", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 567261, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support-requests", "name": "tickets", "label": "Support Requests"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "adatagenerator", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/crazycrv/", "username": "crazycrv", "name": "Chirag Viradiya"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rphall/", "username": "rphall", "name": "Rick Hall"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adatagenerator/screenshot/319197.jpg", "caption": "Sampling Pipeline", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adatagenerator/screenshot/319197.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adatagenerator/screenshot/318835.jpg", "caption": "Data generation and sampling process", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adatagenerator/screenshot/318835.jpg/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://adatagenerator.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "fullname": "MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "id": 524}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "id": 133}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "fullname": "WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "id": 419}]}}
