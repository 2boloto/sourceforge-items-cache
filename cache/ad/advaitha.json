It also provides some utilities that developers can quickly use to make their application more easy to administer. \r\n\r\nImagine an application determining execution of logic based on the status of the environment it operates in. Imagine an application automatically routing requests to another instance based on the health of the environment. Imagine an application making sending administrators communication if it determines that its operating environment is not stable. By means of APIs and a suite of tools, Advaitha is extensible, loosely coupled and plug and play in nature. Existing applications can be retrofitted to become \"Environment aware\" and new applications can benefit being built right from the scratch up.
