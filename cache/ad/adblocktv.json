The viewer has limited influence over what is displayed on TV. This can make watching television an unpleasant activity, because the user is exposed to scenes that he had no intention of watching. Examples of such scenes are brutal moments in a movie that are not suitable for children or are advertisements that interrupt a movie.\r\n\r\nThe AdblockTV project aims at creating a system where a user can select filters and decide what content would be displayed on his/her TV. The system can be used is a similar way as Adblock Plus is being used with browsers. A user's STB device would download special filters indexing TV advertisments or uwanted content in live TV broadcasts/movies. Then a STB device would recognize scenes described by filters and decide how to present a content depending on user preferences. The AdblockTV can also be used in a distributed manner, where advanced server side content analysis algorithms tag live TV broadcasts.", "shortname": "adblocktv", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The AdblockTV is a live tagging and filtering system for TV.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 719336}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/adblocktv/", "video_url": ""}
