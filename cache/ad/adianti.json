Adianti Framework is a component-based and event-driven framework that uses commonly known enterprise design patterns like MVC (Model View Controller), Front Controller and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) design patterns like Active Record and Repository. Adianti Framework is also the first framework in the world that provides two different widget toolkits, one for Web applications (HTML/CSS) and another for graphical applications (with Graphical User Interface) that uses Gtk internally.\r\nOnce the Adianti Framework provides two widget toolkits, the developer writes one code and is able to run its application under the web environment and also as a graphical application. The application will work with two interfaces: Web and Gtk. The next figure demonstrates the the same application running with the two widget toolkits.
