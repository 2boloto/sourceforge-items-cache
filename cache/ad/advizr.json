You can then make informed decisions about what content to server to your clients based on their specific browsers capabilities instead of having to manipulate it on the client side once the page data has already been sent. This allows for much clearner, leaner and more efficient server to client responses.\r\n\r\n* At the moment Advizr only supports PHP but this will be expanded in the future to include other languages.", "summary": "Advizr offers browser feature reporting to you server side technology", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 614665, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "advizr", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/apitofme/", "username": "apitofme", "name": "apitofme"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
