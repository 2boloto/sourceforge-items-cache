The worlds will be persistent, and the player can start another adventurer in the same world, thus preserving the legacy of the original and their impact upon the world.\r\n\r\nI, the current lead developer Kalasen, started this project up once before elsewhere as a way of learning C#. I have learned much in the process, but the underlying architecture was a mess. This is essentially a rebooting of the original project, taking a different approach to the architecture and goals. For example, instead of the world being comprised of distinct levels at the center of which the camera focuses, the world will be seamless and the camera will follow the player. Instead of focusing on dungeon crawling mechanics first, world generation and interaction with said world will be the focus.", "summary": "Tile-based game inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, and roguelikes", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 659634, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "adventurer", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kalasen/", "username": "kalasen", "name": "Kalasen Zyphurus"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
