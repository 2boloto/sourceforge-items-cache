This software will automagically start/stop your Virtual Machine gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be advised: \r\nThe Tray app sucessfully Gracefully startsup and powersoff the VM's in the list in the TrayApp. However if the user shuts down while the Service is still running, then the VM's go into an Aborted state. To avoid this use the tray app to easily stop the service to poweroff the vms.\r\nIf at any point the user just shutdowns the system, the service will be able start up the VM's in the list at startup regardless.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vboxtrinket", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/stevenh1989/", "username": "stevenh1989", "name": "Steven Hernandez"}], "external_homepage": "https://github.com/stevenh1989/VBoxTrinket"}
