We spend time and money on doing simple IT tasks like software installation, backup, upgrade, migration, etc. We build those installation processes that many other people have build in the past instead of reusing what was done, improve and share to create best practices. More, what\u2019s been delivered is not always exactly what business expected because people who deliver don\u2019t own business processes. Idea is simple, let managers define how IT should support their business by defining required automation processes with simple tasks that can be translated into executables by IT. Those can be shared with others, re-used and improved in order to build the best solutions using best practices.
