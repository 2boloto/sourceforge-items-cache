That means, you can enable the software to generate audio files of the words you did not know. I found this very effective, because I could use the dead time (waiting for bus/train) or before getting to sleep, and listen to the audio files of the new words. The audio files for each day won't be more than some minutes = not boring!!\r\n\r\nA sample study plan could be like this:\r\n- enter some new words everyday (10-15)\r\n- work with the software 5-10 min a day and just click if you can remember the meaning or not.\r\n- copy the audio files in your device and listen to them (less than 10 min) in the daily dead time.\r\n\r\nFor a tutorial, please check the Wiki.\r\nEnjoy", "shortname": "pytner", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Leitner flash card system based on Python", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "pytner", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2307614}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pytner/", "video_url": null}
