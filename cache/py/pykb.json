Static data and schemas for PostgreSQL and MySQL are provided.  Aggregates exist along with code to maintain them to enable high speed reports for summarized data.  A point calculation system is included as is support for parsing German and Russian kill mail text.\r\n\r\nCaching exists in two forms, a basic in memory dict based caching system suitable for single process tasks and integration with uwsgi's powerful and fast built in cache.\r\n\r\nUtility modules are provided for adding in killmails, backfilling killmails and dumping them via the command line.  These also serve as reusable code for web apps or at least as usage examples.\r\n\r\nA sample web app using pykb is included.", "shortname": "pykb", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Python Killboard Platform for EVE Online", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 733981}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pykb/", "video_url": ""}
