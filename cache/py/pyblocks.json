I tried to render everything with OpenGL and as expected, found myself in the middle of a multitude of problems relating to it. The blocks look a lot cooler in 3d though, so I hope I'll manage to resume studying what went wrong and eventually fix it. If I had a Windows machine to do development on, I might try to rewrite everything in Unity, but until they make a Linux dev platform, I think I'll remain with pygame and pyOpenGL.", "shortname": "pyblocks", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 316343}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pyblocks/", "video_url": ""}
