I have switched to Lua/LOVE as my language of choice, and am working on porting Pylot to Lua.\r\n\r\nPylot is a multi-stage project to build a complex 2D spaceflight game in Python, inspired by Asteroids, XPilot, and Luola. The first stage of the project, which has been completed, is to create a clone of Asteroids - with a few improvements on the original gameplay. The second stage is to develop the game into a clone of XPilot, and will include client-server multiplayer. The third stage is to incorporate elements from other games, such as the little-known cave-flyer called Luola, including destructible terrain, circular gravity sources and EVAs.", "shortname": "pylotgame", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "abandoned", "summary": "2D space game with semi-realistic physics", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 998259}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pylotgame/", "video_url": null}
