The SMP is the first high-resolution snow penetrometer. It is capable of measuring the bonding force between snow grains, with both high spatial resolution and high speed. The SMP can be used in different application areas as snow profiling (avalanche forecasting, snow stratigraphy, remote sensing ground truth), ski track characterization (ski racing) or snow runway characterization (stability testing).", "shortname": "pyntreader", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Python based reader for SnowMicroPen\u00ae .pnt measurements", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2083215}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pyntreader/", "video_url": null}
