There contains a main file called pyVenture.py which when run will play the game that has been created in the pyVenture.py file. It is a simple text based game (like zork...ish) that allows users to traverse through different rooms they create. At the conclusion of the game (which is designed to be a mystery) they get to ask the player a question. This question can be anything that the user has \"learned along the way\" and will allow them to solve the mystery.\r\n\r\nThere is also a feature in the room class called addFunction which allows the user to pass a generic function to the class. This function is passed in such a way that they can define it to be anything they want and must be executed before you can enter that room. This makes it exciting for more advanced students because they can battle a Troll for example.", "shortname": "pyventure", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "McMaster CAS Outreach Project For Children", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1740501}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pyventure/", "video_url": ""}
