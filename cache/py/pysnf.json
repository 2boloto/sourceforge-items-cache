With PySNF, users can calculate probe-corrected far-field radiation patterns from spherical near-field antenna measurements. In addition, spherical wave coefficients from simulated or measured antenna radiation patterns can be obtained. The vast majority of the code in this module was developed using equations presented in the book Spherical Near-Field Antenna Measurements, edited by J.E.
