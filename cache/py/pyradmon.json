Soon the script will also feature local logging, graphing and alerting.\r\n\r\nJust because the Cold War is \"over\" does not mean that there is no more threat of a radiological attack. In fact, the U.S. Homeland Security Council lists the \"Detonation of a 10 Megaton Improvised Nuclear Device\" as \"Scenario #1\" among the top 15 threats to American security.  Or, if you do not believe that a nuclear bomb is likely, what about all the Chernobyl-style Soviet-era nuclear power stations still in service?  The point is: let us work together as free people to jointly report and track radiation levels around the globe.  Information is power--and more importantly, information can save lives.\r\n\r\nThis project is known to work on Raspberry Pi and various Linux distributions.\r\n\r\nBoth PyRadMon and RadMon.org are completely free, though donations are always appreciated.", "shortname": "pyradmon", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@PyRadMon", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/pyradmon", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Automated reporting of Geiger Muller counter readings to RadMon.org", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2137176}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pyradmon/", "video_url": null}
