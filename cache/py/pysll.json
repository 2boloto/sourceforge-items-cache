This means that coding in SLL isn't designed to be easy, it's meant to be a challenge. \r\n\r\nSLL uses stacks and registers to interact with data. There are no datatypes, no classes, methods or variables. Without these, the programmer is forced to think out of the box, even for simple tasks like making a calculator, printing out messages etc.\r\n\r\nPySLL is the ported over version of the original, coded in Batch.
