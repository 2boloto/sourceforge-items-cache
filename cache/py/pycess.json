It facilitates the construction of web applications in communities of process-minded people without programming knowledge or organisation. \r\nBased on a) organisational roles (lanes) and b) process steps (timeline) the pycess-generated application presents web forms to the user who belongs to a defined role. A user approves notifications generated by the Pycess application, and thus triggers follow-up steps.\r\nWhile allowing arbitrary complex processes to be realized, pycess is less ambitious with regard to sophisticated desktop-like user interfaces.\r\nDjango serves as the application framework, based on Python, which runs on most common OSes like Linux, BSDs and Windows. \r\nDatabases need to provide DB functions or recursion, like PostgreSQL, DB2, MS-SQL, Oracle (not MySQL).\r\nRead the Wiki page for more.", "shortname": "pycess", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Process machine for creating web applications, based on Django/Python", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 658835}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pycess/", "video_url": ""}
