It includes a script development kit for developers. Despite being written in PHP the application doesn't require a web server because it's core is being compiled with ExeOutput For PHP, an utility that can convert a web app into executable. It also allows creation of system functions, classes, arrays and many other components that can be used in scripts development. The application uses winSCP to upload files automatically on sourceforge. The log in information is encrypted to prevent sourceforge account stealth. Everything except the executable is open source. The application will automatically download and install the needed components and optionally the SDK for script development on 1st run. You may begin downloading software update checking scripts for your installed programs immediately and do all kinds of scans to see what's outdated.
