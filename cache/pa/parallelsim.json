The number of processors is scalable and can be increased in subsequent iterations of simulation. The parameters like initial load, load offset, number of processors  are declared as constants and can be changed directly in the source code to emulate different scenarios. It is also capable of plotting a graph at the end of each simulation to give an overview of how the simulation went. The output of simulation will vary from machine to machine depending upon the underlying hardware, for e.g., the timings will be different on a dual core and a quad core processor.
