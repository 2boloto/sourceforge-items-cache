But unit tests are frequently built in such a way that developers are required to run the tests - they are unusable by testers without detailed knowledge of the tests themselves.\r\n\r\nPapio seeks to simplify the way tests are run. Unit tests can now be put together  into sequences in a GUI and executed on demand. Results are gathered in a standard format.\r\n\r\nThe project will initially target Python tests, but it is expected that Java and .Net will soon follow. C++ testing might also be possible.", "shortname": "papio", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A cross-platform, cross-language unit test driver system", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2242940}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/papio/", "video_url": null}
