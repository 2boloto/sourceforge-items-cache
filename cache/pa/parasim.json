ParaSim addresses this challenge by parallelizing the calculations according to the number of computing cores available on a single machine. It is optimized for the throughput of very large numbers of query structures against very large numbers of reference structures. As as special feature, ParaSim allows to store and and to access frequently queried datasets as persistant objects in memory for short response times.\r\n\r\nParaSim calculates chemical similarities based on binary structural fingerprints. It does not compute fingerprints by itself but relies on third party software to do so. Basically, all types of structural fingerprints which can be stored in an array of bits (a bitset) can be used by ParaSim.\r\n\r\nSee the Wiki (https://sourceforge.net/p/parasim/wiki/Documentation/) for detailed documentation.\r\n\r\nFEEDBACK HIGHLY APPRECIATED!", "shortname": "parasim", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Parallelized calculation of molecular similarities", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 734018}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/parasim/", "video_url": ""}
