Its most important output is the highest peak of the cross correlation function. It also gives info such as the second peak, the time delays of both peaks, and the standard deviation of the cross correlation function. There is also a built in option for a phase synchronization based method. The program is specifically tailored to deal with climate anomaly records in ascii format, so some adaptation may be required for your specific needs... It also supports a masking option in order to select only a subset of all possible pairs, and a surrogate run with scrambled years.
