It is an attempt to develop authentication interactions involving a 3D avatar.  It's vision is that of a tool that can replace other means of authentication in fun and easier to remember way.  \r\nFrom security perspective, the best kind of passwords, are long strings of random characters drawn from a large alphabet of characters. But these are hard to memorize and thus becomes a burden to the user.  We shall use a sequence of interactions that the user of a smart phone performs with a detailed 3D avatar as his or her password to unlock the phone. Our intuition is that a sequence of interactions with an interesting avatar might be easy to remember and also if the avatar is detailed enough, the number of possible sequences of interactions can be quite large, proffering pretty good security.
