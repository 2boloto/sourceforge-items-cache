We try to keep them as generic as possible so that the images can be generalized, for that reason they are not compiled with any vendor-specific flags or any particular drivers (The images are compiled with the default boot config in Ubuntu 12.04)  \r\n\r\nEach image is carefully compiled for maximum optimization with other options and PaX patches are added as well. The aim of this project is to provide easy-to-install kernel images and headers for x86 architecture. \r\n\r\nYou may also be wondering why I haven't uploaded any code in the repositories, well the linux kernel code is available at kernel.org anyways so uploading it again is redundant and here the aim is to provide easy to use images that can be installed with single-click so I don't need to upload any source code, in near future as we make more changes the source code will be made available.  \r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ubuntugrsec", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kernlogger/", "username": "kernlogger", "name": "Vikram Dhillon"}], "external_homepage": ""}
