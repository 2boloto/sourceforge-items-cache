We have tested it with the help of a school and atleast two children were able to pick up some words, with just a little practice.  It is our hope that with more words and a tablet pc, they can help themselves to practice continuously and attain a level of proficiency that would make life easier on them.\r\n\r\nWe are releasing this software now, as we hope that it would encourage more talented developers and designers to put in their expertise and make this a workable idea with out any language and regional barriers, so that it can be useful to all the 416 million disabled without any cost.", "shortname": "rhema", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Free Open Source Software for the Speech & Hearing Impaired", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1882313}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rhema/", "video_url": ""}
