Fundamentally we try to get the same overall effect of the Ubuntu-based Main Edition, as this release uses the MATE desktop environment. \r\nDebian proves to have low resource requirements, and performance benefits. It is able to run comfortably on a 486 PC with 256 Mb of RAM!\r\nThe performance is even greater if one uses the multicore PAE i686 kernel.\r\nThe disadvantage is that certain applications and tools have better equivalents in Ubuntu, or worse, no Debian version of the Ubuntu release. This means that the development and the look and feel of certain components had to be practically custom-built.\r\nWe think the end-result was worth it.
