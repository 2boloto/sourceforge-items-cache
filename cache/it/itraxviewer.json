Compared to other applications, this tool is offered free of charge and is developed with the today technologies of modeling and rendering 3D.\r\nThe performance characteristics and functionality will be based on high costs commercially available and limited academic use applications. This will result in rendering three-dimensional models and navigation techniques with an efficient information processing.\r\nFinally, the project looks to improve the quality of service in the health area through the development of diagnostic technologies and make a contribution of initiative to the research and software development in the medical informatics area of our country.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "itraxviewer", "_id": "4f581f9f0594ca1386000994", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 717442, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Software tool for visualization of brain fibers in 3D", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization", "shortname": "visualization", "fullname": "Visualization", "id": 135}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Adaptive Public License", "shortname": "adaptive", "fullname": "Adaptive Public License", "id": 628}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Cocoa (MacOS X)", "shortname": "cocoa", "fullname": "Cocoa (MacOS X)", "id": 310}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: Fink (Mac OS X)", "shortname": "fink", "fullname": "Fink (Mac OS X)", "id": 429}]}}
