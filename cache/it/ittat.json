This is a laborious academic process designed to reveal the themes emerging in the interview.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe process (broadly) involves adorning text with 'first impression' comments, distilling these into a series of themes which are often color-coded into the text with highlighting. Finally these themes are further distilled into only a few key-themes.\u00a0\r\n\r\nMy University recommended Microsoft Word for this task. However the process of highlighting and commenting large volumes of text is enormously time consuming in MS word. Furthermore MS word is poorly equipped to group or manipulate text based on highlighting.\r\n\r\nITTAT then is a free tool to make the process of highlighting, commenting and thematic grouping of text simple and fast.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ittat", "_id": "5161a497ea406b22e3e6fffe", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1495120, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "ITTAT (Interview Transcription & Thematic Analysis Tool).", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Social sciences :: Psychology", "shortname": "psychology", "fullname": "Psychology", "id": 807}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Tk", "shortname": "ui_tk", "fullname": "Tk", "id": 478}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
