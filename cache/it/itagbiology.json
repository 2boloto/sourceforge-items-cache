In addition, 4 modifiers are available to further increase the options during a tagging session. Users are able to load a series of Images into a session and add tags on objects on these images within previously defined categories and modifiers.\r\nUpon ending the session, result files are produced including (if provided by the EXIF data) the gps information for each Picture, the number of objects in each category and a detailed result file that describes each individual object.
