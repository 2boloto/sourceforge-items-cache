LWCMS operates as a backend to manage the content of websites and web applications, but has minimal impact on the site layout. This allows developers to create the frontend layout, design, and logic and then use LWCMS to setup content management that conforms to the already existing flow of the website or web application being built. LWCMS is perfect for developers that do not want their site to be forced to conform to the logic of the content managment system.
