Basically this is related to the computation of the distribution of k co-occurrences of spatial events (generalising the contiguity distributions - 2 co-occurrences at distance 0) to derive spatial clustering statistics (mainly using the Shannon entropy, then called the k-spatial entropy) and methods linked to this: SOOk, SelSOOk (see caGEO paper) and scankOO (see TGIS). Another method (CAkOO) performing a k-Correspondence Analysis (i.e. on a multiway table with k entries) on the contingencies of co-occurrenceshas been already \"published in my JSS paper about another R package: PTAk.\r\nAt the moment the basic scripts I have are based on points and use the R package spatstat, but I would like also to extend to any geometry type.
