The HMR goal is to virtually rebuild old computers so it is possible for everyone to use them and actually feel how hardware and software technologies evolved in the course of time.\r\n\r\nThe Macchina Ridotta (that in Italian means Smaller Machine) was the very first computer built in Italy by the University of Pisa in 1957. The MR is also the first machine rebuilded by the HMR project.\r\n\r\nMore in general, HMR aims to support researchers and enthusiasts in computer science history. As part of this goal, the Computer History Knowledge Base (CHKB) subproject was launched.
