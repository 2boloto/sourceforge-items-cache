The primary step in such an analysis should be not only a separation between natural and artificial labelling of metabolites that both contribute to the measured mass spectrometry data, but also correction for \u201cimpurities\u201d of the assay media that give peaks overlapping with the desired pattern. Whereas the former became a routine procedure, the latter still remains a problem.\r\n To perform such a separation of natural distribution and correction of overlapping peaks, we developed a \u201cR\u201d program. This program offers two ways of corrections of \u201cimpurities\u201d resulted from overlapping of the assayed mass isotopomer distribution with peaks produced either by unknown metabolites in the media, or by different fragments containing the assayed metabolite.
