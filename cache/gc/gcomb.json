However, we coders did our best to make sure that our implementation would not depend on comments in GCode or slicer-specific details, so it should work given files generated by Slic3r and others as well as Skeinforge. \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gcomb", "_id": "52137a1b909547293a0ad51c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1935635, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "GComb is a gCode viewing tool with an interior focus", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
