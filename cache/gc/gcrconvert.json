The ouput cosmic-ray distribution  is in the form of FITS files which however are not convenient for viewing or plotting with the standard ftools program fv, since the files have 4 or 5 dimensional arrays (due to the momentum and species axes) while fv  handles only 3 dimensional arrays. This program converts to fv-compatible FITS files, either from 2D to (R,z) or from 3D to (x,z) at y=0 or (x,y) at z=0, in each case for a chosen cosmic-ray species.\r\nThe third axis is momentum in each case. The distribution can be viewed with fv as a colour image, contoured, output to a file etc.\r\nThe program is stand-alone and requires only the cfitsio library to be installed. Build instructions are in the program header.\r\nThe FITS.cc/FITS.h class used provides simple convenient access to image data, useful also for other projects.\r\nFor fv and cfitsio see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gcrconvert", "_id": "522c2359c4314308a97c83f8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1948490, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "converts cosmic-ray files from GALPROP for viewing / plotting.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Astronomy", "shortname": "astronomy", "fullname": "Astronomy", "id": 134}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
