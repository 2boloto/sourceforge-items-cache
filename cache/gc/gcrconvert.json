The ouput cosmic-ray distribution  is in the form of FITS files which however are not convenient for viewing or plotting with the standard ftools program fv, since the files have 4 or 5 dimensional arrays (due to the momentum and species axes) while fv  handles only 3 dimensional arrays. This program converts to fv-compatible FITS files, either from 2D to (R,z) or from 3D to (x,z) at y=0 or (x,y) at z=0, in each case for a chosen cosmic-ray species.\r\nThe third axis is momentum in each case. The distribution can be viewed with fv as a colour image, contoured, output to a file etc.\r\nThe program is stand-alone and requires only the cfitsio library to be installed. Build instructions are in the program header.\r\nThe FITS.cc/FITS.h class used provides simple convenient access to image data, useful also for other projects.\r\nFor fv and cfitsio see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio", "shortname": "gcrconvert", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "converts cosmic-ray files from GALPROP for viewing / plotting.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1948490}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gcrconvert/", "video_url": ""}
