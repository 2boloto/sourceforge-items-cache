It was developed because of Garmin's utter lack of support for Linux OS.  This Python project has been tested in a limited capacity in Python 2.6.5 under Linux and Python 2.7.2 under Windows XP as well. \r\n\r\n**Tapiriik is an open source web service which syncs data between various sports GPS web sites as well as Dropbox.  The current version of GcpUploader borrows heavily from Tapiriik source code for authentication.  In light of Tapiriik's versatility, elegance, and continued development It is HIGHLY recommended that you consider swithching to Tapiriik.
