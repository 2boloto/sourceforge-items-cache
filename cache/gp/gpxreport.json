My favorite one is gps-prune to view gps tracks on a map and make changes. However, I was missing a simple tool to store summary information about a gpx track into a database to keep track of my training efforts. That's why I created GPXReport.\r\nGPXReport is a desktop solution which is written in Java and should run on most computers. The program can read a gpx-file and calculate basics information such as:\r\n- overall and moving time\r\n- distance (km), \r\n- average and max speed\r\n- time, km uphill and downhill\r\nIt automatically classifies the acitvity as hiking, MTB or race bike. Each track information can be added to a Sqlite database. The program can display all information of the database and summarize it by activity. \r\n", "shortname": "gpxreport", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Analyze gpx files and store summary in Sqlite database", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1097263}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gpxreport/", "video_url": ""}
