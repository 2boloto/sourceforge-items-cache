Using gpg-remailer the list of members of a group of people who\r\nwant to exchange encrypted and authenticated e-mail can be maintained at\r\none location, allowing the members of the group to specify just one e-mail\r\naddress to send PGP/GPG signed and encrypted e-mail to.\r\n\r\nGpg-remailer recognizes the following e-mail formats:\r\n    *  Standard simple encrypted messages.\r\n    *  Multi-part encrypted messages.\r\n    *  Encrypted messages containing detached signatures.\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gpgremailer", "_id": "513f23d824b0d94525321474", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1364821, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "forwards re-encrypted PGP/GPG mail to a group", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: Email", "shortname": "email", "fullname": "Email", "id": 28}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Cryptography", "shortname": "cryptography", "fullname": "Cryptography", "id": 44}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "id": 238}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "id": 866}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Security", "shortname": "secindustry", "fullname": "Security", "id": 867}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
