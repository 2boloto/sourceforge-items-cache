HBS Analyzer can accept raw hairpin-bisulfite sequencing data in FASTA or FASTQ format, align the paired end reads to the reference genome and call methylation. Given the double stranded nature of the data that is used, HBS analyzer can identify errors caused by PCR and sequencing along with identifying hemi-methylated sites. This error information is also considered while making the methylation call and hence methylation sites introduced by SNPs are also identified along with the known methylation sites in the genome.
