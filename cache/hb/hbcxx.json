This is not because the language has been changed massively but because the new\r\nfeatures encourage a different, and slightly higher level way to think\r\nabout writing C++. It's faster, more fun, supports lambdas, has tools to simplify memory management and includes regular expressions in the standard library.\r\n\r\nhbcxx is a tool to keep things fast and fun by putting of the moment you have to write a build system and an install script. For simple programs, especially for quick and dirty personal toys, the day you have to write a proper build system may never come.\r\n\r\nInstead just copy your C++ source code into $HOME/bin.
