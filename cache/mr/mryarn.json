A user\u2019s demand is often changing over time, indicating that it is difficult to keep the high resource utilization all the time for cost efficiency. Resource sharing is an effective approach for high resource utilization. In view of the heterogeneous resource demands of workloads in the cloud, multi-resource allocation fairness is a must for resource sharing in cloud computing. MRYARN is proposed for multi-resource fair allocation on the cloud. It ensures that each user in  cloud computing can at least get the amount of total resources as that under the exclusively non-sharing environment in the long term. Moreover,  MRYARN  can guarantee that no users can get more amount of total allocated resources over time by lying their demands. Finally, MRYARN  has a mechanism to discourage users to submit cost-inefficient workloads, especially when there are some idle resources they truly do not need.", "shortname": "mryarn", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Multi-Resource YARN (MRYARN) Fair Scheduler for Cloud Computing", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2287088}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Git", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "SVN", "mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mryarn/", "video_url": null}
