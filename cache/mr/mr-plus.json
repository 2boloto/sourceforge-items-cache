However, unlike Hadoop, MR+ enables both map and reduce to interleave, as well as the same key to be reduced by different reduce workers in parallel \u2013 permitting multi- level reduces.\r\n\r\nIn the MR+ implementation, although the role of the JobTracker and Task- Tracker is identical to that in Hadoop, the details of task scheduling are completely different. To achieve interleaving of maps and reduces, MR+ tasks are allocated according to a configurable map to reduce schedule ratio parameter1. The first reduce task is scheduled as soon as a certain number of map tasks complete. The reduces form  an inverted tree of reduces over various reduce levels, doing away with the traditional brick  wall between map and reduce stages.", "shortname": "mr-plus", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "MR+ advocates a departure from a fixed two-stage process of MapReduce.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1053948}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mr-plus/", "video_url": ""}
