The binary is 15 to 20 kilobytes in size, depending on configuration and CPU architecture. MrHTTPD serves files at up to 4 times the throughput of Apache and runs CGI scripts. It scales very well with high levels of concurrency and responds very well to the BFS CPU scheduler by Con Kolivas. \r\n\r\nOne of the differentiating features is that the server is configured at compile time only. It will not read a configuration file at runtime. That makes it suitable for embedded systems as well.\r\n\r\nRead the documentation included in the distribution for more information.\r\n\r\nKeywords: CGI URL http server httpd non-blocking sockets thread ", "shortname": "mrhttpd", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A lightning fast, simple, robust and secure web server.", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 190478}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mrhttpd/", "video_url": ""}
