The iTouch actually controls the actions of my Macbook through Max MSP, playing songs and switching playlists at firewire quality, NOT playing songs off the iTouch at all.\r\n\r\nNow I focus on controlling the car's TVIS system, or variable intake butterfly control. The software is designed in Max already, all I need is a consistent real-time RPM signal which can be fed through the Arduino into Max MSP. Harder said than done, due to Maxuino's ISR limitations.", "shortname": "mrduino", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Max MSP/Arduino to create command center for MR2 sensors and controls", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 712493}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mrduino/", "video_url": ""}
