By default, the thermodynamic equilibrium constants used in mrocs are those recommended by Best-Practices Guide (Dickson et al., 2007). The mrocs package also includes options to use more recent formulations for K1 and K2 from Millero (2010) and for total boron from Lee et al. (2010). \r\n\r\nThe mrocs package is designed for users with some programming experience, either in Fortran or python. Others would will prefer the facility of packages such as the Excel version of CO2sys.  Because mrocs is computationally much faster, it is suited for big data and ocean models. For models, mrocs offers improved accuracy by avoiding 3 common approximations. Its computed variables generally agree with those from CO2sys within 0.005% (Orr and Epitalon, 2013).", "shortname": "mrocs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Model routines for the ocean carbonate system", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1806881}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mrocs/", "video_url": ""}
