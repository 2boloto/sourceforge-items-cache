The intent is to create a fan based modification that illustrates a more pronounced progression from Feudal to Castle and subsequently Imperial Ages, after all we're talking multiple centuries here! With the larger resolution and population cap of the HD version of Age of Empires 2 it's time to increase the size of buildings and create dense urban environments at the latter stages of a match. It's also perfect for scenario makers that want to try out something different. Many thanks to Ensemble for creating this amazing game!!
