AOD enables cross-cutting data concerns to be added to a database using aspect-oriented programming (AOP). A cross-cutting data concern is a data need that is universal (potentially applicable to the entire database) and widespread (can be used to enhance many, different databases). Data has a wide variety of cross-cutting data concerns, including provenance, time, lineage, and security. So this research has the potential to impact every database. But developers currently have to rely on ad-hoc techniques to add these concerns to a data collection. To make the task easier, more flexible, and more general, we plan to apply techniques adapted from AOP to database management systems, preserving key benefits of the aspect-oriented approach.", "summary": "Supports data aspects for Pig Latin.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1098252, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "aopiglatin", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/cdyreson/", "username": "cdyreson", "name": "Curtis Dyreson"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://cs.usu.edu/~cdyreson/aspectOrientedData/index.htm", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
