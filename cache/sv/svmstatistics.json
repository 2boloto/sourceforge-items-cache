However, identifying\r\nbrain regions that significantly contribute to the classification/group\r\nseparation requires computationally expensive permutation testing. In this\r\npaper we show that the results of SVM-permutation testing can be analytically\r\napproximated. This approximation leads to more than a thousand fold\r\nspeed up of the permutation testing procedure, thereby rendering it feasible\r\nto perform such tests on standard computers. The speed up achieved makes\r\nSVM based group difference analysis competitive with standard univariate\r\ngroup difference analysis methods.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "svmstatistics", "_id": "513fae727929e552634da161", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1370673, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
