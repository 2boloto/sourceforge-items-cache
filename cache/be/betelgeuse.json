It was designed to be efficient, reliable, and highly modular; it is developed primarily in Python to promote maintainability and rapid development, but uses Cython and C in critical bottlenecks for efficiency. It focuses on high-quality implementations of a diverse set of the most widely used machine learning algorithms. An important goal of Betelgeuse is to have a clean, professional user interface amenable to less technical users, and to have multiple user interfaces for graphical, command line, and remote server use.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "betelgeuse", "_id": "50a5b6cd0594ca04acb782c6", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1085409, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Powerful machine learning modeling software suitable for industry use.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence :: Machine Learning", "shortname": "machinelearning", "fullname": "Machine Learning", "id": 802}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Affero GNU Public License", "shortname": "agpl", "fullname": "Affero GNU Public License", "id": 670}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Healthcare Industry", "shortname": "healthcareindustry", "fullname": "Healthcare Industry", "id": 362}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
