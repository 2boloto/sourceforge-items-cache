It was designed to be efficient, reliable, and highly modular; it is developed primarily in Python to promote maintainability and rapid development, but uses Cython and C in critical bottlenecks for efficiency. It focuses on high-quality implementations of a diverse set of the most widely used machine learning algorithms. An important goal of Betelgeuse is to have a clean, professional user interface amenable to less technical users, and to have multiple user interfaces for graphical, command line, and remote server use.", "shortname": "betelgeuse", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Powerful machine learning modeling software suitable for industry use.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1085409}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/betelgeuse/", "video_url": ""}
