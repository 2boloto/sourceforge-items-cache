The Bear100 is an annual 100 mile, 2 day race on foot through the Rocky Mountains in North America.\r\n\r\nWill communicate via serial over a 1200 baud AX.25 link to a ARES/Data backend (which we call NetControl).  Can initialize some hardware TNCs with parameters optimal for ARES/Data topology.  See ARES paper for topology/backend: http://www.tapr.org/pub_cnc07.html\r\n\r\nAll Aid Stations are expected to use same frequency concurrently, and optionally send queries to Net Control.
