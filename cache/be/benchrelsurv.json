The implemented algorithms and the results of two macros (SAS) demonstrate how aggregated data sources can be used for external quality assurance purposes. Comparisons of health care quality of cancer screening programs and therapeutic interventions via the estimation of five indices are delivered. The exemplary results show cross-sectional as well as longitudinal variations and may indicate a first step for the course of action in terms of health care politics, hospital management and quality of health care provision. Empirical grounds for a debate of further quality improvements should be given. The method can be adopted for every other illness with disease phases.
