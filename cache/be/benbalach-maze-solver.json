All you have to do is draw the maze in a text file using: the character 'T' to represent a free space, 'P' to represent a wall, the character 'S' to represent the starting point, and 'F' to represent the finishing point. Just drag and drop the text file into the program and select which algorithm you would like the program to use to solve the maze. Currently you can choose either the Recursive algorithm (which does not give you the shortest path) or the Breadth-first search algorithm (gives you the shortest path).\r\n\r\nBuilding requirements:\r\nYou compiler needs to support C++ 11 if your compiling the C++ version.\r\nYou compiler needs to support C99 if your compiling the C version.", "summary": "Solves mazes", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2277621, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "benbalach-maze-solver", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/benbalach/", "username": "benbalach", "name": "Ben Balach"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://benbalach-maze-solver.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
