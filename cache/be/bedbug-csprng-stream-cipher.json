It exhibits uniform distribution, mixes rapidly (with worst-case avalanche better than 16-bits), has no detected bias, and comes in three variants: BEDBUG128, with an internal state array of 128+3 32-bit words; BEDBUG256, with an internal state of 256+3 words; and BEDBUG512 with a 512+3-word state. The former permit seeding with a key of up to 4096 or 8192 bits, the latter with a 16384-bit key.\r\n\r\nThe BEDBUG generator itself is a mere 5 lines of code: Three rotations; two pseudo-random lookups. \r\n\r\nThe default BEDBUG configuration alternates the rotation constants unpredictably. These four sets of three values differ between BEDBUG128, BEDBUG256 and BEDBUG512 and were selected, tuned and tested in each case for optimal avalanche, which is never less than 16.5 bits.\r\n\r\nBEDBUG has passed stringent industry-standard tests for randomness, including NIST and DIEHARD.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bedbug-csprng-stream-cipher", "_id": "5409952a0910d46471a74064", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2318251, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "A family of FLEA-inspired CSPRNGs and Stream Ciphers", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "shortname": "communications", "fullname": "Communications", "id": 20}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Cryptography", "shortname": "cryptography", "fullname": "Cryptography", "id": 44}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 71}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Free Pascal", "shortname": "freepascal", "fullname": "Free Pascal", "id": 699}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: X Window System (X11)", "shortname": "x11", "fullname": "X Window System (X11)", "id": 229}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other Audience", "id": 5}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Security", "shortname": "secindustry", "fullname": "Security", "id": 867}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: WINE", "shortname": "wine", "fullname": "WINE", "id": 430}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
