The former permit seeding with a key of up to 4096 or 8192 bits, the latter with a 16384-bit key.\r\n\r\nThe BEDBUG generator itself is a mere 5 lines of code: Three rotations; two pseudo-random lookups. \r\n\r\nThe default BEDBUG configuration alternates the rotation constants unpredictably. These four sets of three values differ between BEDBUG128, BEDBUG256 and BEDBUG512 and were selected, tuned and tested in each case for optimal avalanche, which is never less than 16.5 bits.\r\n\r\nBEDBUG has passed stringent industry-standard tests for randomness, including NIST and DIEHARD.\r\n", "shortname": "bedbug-csprng-stream-cipher", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A family of FLEA-inspired CSPRNGs and Stream Ciphers", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2318251}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bedbug-csprng-stream-cipher/", "video_url": null}
