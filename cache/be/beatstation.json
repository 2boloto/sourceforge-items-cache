Take a look at the wiki page for more info. For instance, you can choose to tap with a midi interface or just use the keyboard. \r\n\r\nbeatStation was designed as a game with a purpose application in which users can compete between each other in tapping various songs. In this setup, you need to have Octave or Matlab installed in order to compute the score for each user.\r\n\r\nThe source code and build instructions can be found at: https://github.com/SMC-INESC/beatStation\r\n\r\nbeatStation can be used by researchers to annotate audio, conduct experiments, or as an inspiration for future apps.\r\n\r\nContact me at miron.marius [at] gmail [dot] com for future questions", "summary": "beatStation is an openFrameworks tapping recorder", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1894747, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "beatstation", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/nkundiushuti/", "username": "nkundiushuti", "name": "Marius Miron"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/beatstation/screenshot/screen.png", "caption": "tapping section", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/beatstation/screenshot/screen.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0", "shortname": "ccanclv2", "id": 871}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: XML-based", "fullname": "XML-based", "shortname": "db_api_xml", "id": 507}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "id": 80}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education", "fullname": "Education", "shortname": "education", "id": 71}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio", "fullname": "Sound/Audio", "shortname": "sound", "id": 113}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "fullname": "Education", "shortname": "education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "fullname": "All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 202}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
