These layers each contain behaviours that can inhibit one another and interact to achieve control. A full discussion of the structure and ideas behind this framework can be found in the Doxygen documentation that comes with the release. This documentation is well worth a read before you decide if the library is for you!\r\n\r\nThe structure and implementation of this library focuses on the application of the inhibition-based behaviour control architecture to real-time control loops, but can reasonably be adapted for a wide variety of other artificial intelligence applications. Emphasis has been placed on having very low overhead so as not to hurt overall system performance, while still maintaining ease of use.\r\n\r\nI welcome all feedback, suggestions and bug reports!\r\nEmail: pallgeuer[at]ais.uni-bonn.de", "summary": "A C++ framework that uses inhibition trees for behaviour control.", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1964819, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "behaviourcontrol", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/pallgeuer/", "username": "pallgeuer", "name": "Philipp Allgeuer"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/behaviourcontrol/screenshot/BCFv1.0_Screenshot_1.png", "caption": "Behaviour Control Framework unit test output (1/3)", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/behaviourcontrol/screenshot/BCFv1.0_Screenshot_1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/behaviourcontrol/screenshot/BCFv1.0_Screenshot_2.png", "caption": "Behaviour Control Framework unit test output (2/3)", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/behaviourcontrol/screenshot/BCFv1.0_Screenshot_2.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/behaviourcontrol/screenshot/BCFv1.0_Screenshot_3.png", "caption": "Behaviour Control Framework unit test output (3/3)", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/behaviourcontrol/screenshot/BCFv1.0_Screenshot_3.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "fullname": "BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "id": 187}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "id": 606}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Robotics", "fullname": "Robotics", "shortname": "robotics", "id": 602}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "id": 770}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: Other Audience", "fullname": "Other Audience", "shortname": "other", "id": 5}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}]}}
