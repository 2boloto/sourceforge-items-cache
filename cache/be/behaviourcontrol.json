These layers each contain behaviours that can inhibit one another and interact to achieve control. A full discussion of the structure and ideas behind this framework can be found in the Doxygen documentation that comes with the release. This documentation is well worth a read before you decide if the library is for you!\r\n\r\nThe structure and implementation of this library focuses on the application of the inhibition-based behaviour control architecture to real-time control loops, but can reasonably be adapted for a wide variety of other artificial intelligence applications. Emphasis has been placed on having very low overhead so as not to hurt overall system performance, while still maintaining ease of use.\r\n\r\nI welcome all feedback, suggestions and bug reports!\r\nEmail: pallgeuer[at]ais.uni-bonn.de", "shortname": "behaviourcontrol", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A C++ framework that uses inhibition trees for behaviour control.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1964819}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/behaviourcontrol/", "video_url": ""}
