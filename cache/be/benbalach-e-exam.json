You have to write the test in a text file and then load it from the program. From there you have the option of choosing exactly how many questions you want in the test (the questions will be chosen at random), you can also randomize the order of the possible answers of all of the questions (while still maintaining the \"right\" correct answers), or if you want you can also randomize the order of the questions. You will also be prompted for a password, this password is used to encrypt the results which will be printed to a text file after the test is over. You also have the option to set the duration of the test. After the time is up the test will be over and the results will be shown on the screen. The results of the test with all of the questions, user's answers, and correct answers will be printed to an encrypted text file.
