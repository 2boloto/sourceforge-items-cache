Of course, such a present will fascinate and your child will simply forget, how many hours have been spent with the new toy. Now, you basically have the following options:\r\n- you can lock up the Christmas present\r\n- you can ignore the problem\r\n- or you negotiate rules on the amount of time that your child is allowed to use the computer.\r\nIn the latter case, you will have keep an eye on the compliance. This simple program might help because you can specify rules like: You are allowed to use your computer an hour a day between 9am and 8pm. The program will log off your child automatically, if the computer is used before 8am, after 9pm or for longer than one hour. (However, this will only work until you child knows what the registry database is.)\r\nRun the program being logged into the system as your child. The program will start automatically on logging in.", "shortname": "rttracker", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "abandoned", "summary": "Tracks time of user activity on (your children's) computer", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1254508}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rttracker/", "video_url": ""}
