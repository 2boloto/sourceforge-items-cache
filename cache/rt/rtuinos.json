Events can now be broadcasted events, semaphores or mutexes. This permits to implement all the usual inter-task communication patterns. Please refer to the user guide and the diverse code samples for details.\r\n\r\nThe second technical change is a complete revision of the makefile. It has been improved in many aspects and it now supports three operating systems; the RTuinOS samples (as well as your applications) can be built under Linux, Windows and Mac OS.\r\n\r\nRTuinOS 1.0 is distributed as setup (a ZIP archive), which contains all source files and the complete documentation, also with source files. Building the samples can be started immediately after unzipping and setting a single environment variable. \r\n\r\nThank you for your kind interest in RTuinOS, your feedback is welcome.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rtuinos", "_id": "554bc02f7929e516068b6a96", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2458680, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "The event based Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for Arduino", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "id": 12}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 71}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Embedded systems", "shortname": "embedded", "fullname": "Embedded systems", "id": 749}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Hobbies", "shortname": "hobbies", "fullname": "Hobbies", "id": 772}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Apple Mac OS Classic", "shortname": "macos9", "fullname": "Apple Mac OS Classic", "id": 311}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
