Please refer to the user guide and the diverse code samples for details.\r\n\r\nThe second technical change is a complete revision of the makefile. It has been improved in many aspects and it now supports three operating systems; the RTuinOS samples (as well as your applications) can be built under Linux, Windows and Mac OS.\r\n\r\nRTuinOS 1.0 is distributed as setup (a ZIP archive), which contains all source files and the complete documentation, also with source files. Building the samples can be started immediately after unzipping and setting a single environment variable. \r\n\r\nThank you for your kind interest in RTuinOS, your feedback is welcome.", "shortname": "rtuinos", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The event based Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for Arduino", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2458680}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rtuinos/", "video_url": null}
