It supports the import of radiotherapy data (e.g. dose distributions and structure sets) from arbitrary format (e.g. stored in DICOM-RT standard format using the open source library DCMTK).\r\n\r\nThe RTToolbox supports the full range of radiotherapy evaluation. Tools such as DVH calculation, arithmetic operations on dose distributions and structure relationship analysis (e.g. fully-contained, partially-contained) are provided as a basis for further calculations. Dose comparison indices such as Conformity Index (CI), Homogeneity Index (HI) and Conformation Number (CN), and biological models including TCP, NTCP, EUD and BED are determined from dose distributions and DVHs. The RTToolbox can be easily extended to support other data format, comparison indices and model.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rttb", "_id": "50fd65a124b0d978aa8f509f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1249505, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Library to support quantitative analysis of radiotherapy data", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Medical Science Apps.", "shortname": "medical", "fullname": "Medical Science Apps.", "id": 266}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Medical Physics", "shortname": "medicalphysics", "fullname": "Medical Physics", "id": 858}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "fullname": "SQL-based", "id": 508}], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": []}}
