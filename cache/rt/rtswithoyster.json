Referent Tracking seeks to assign an instance unique identifier (IUI) to each individual person, process, disease, prescription, fracture, tumor, etc. Duplicate assignment of IUIs is therefore highly problematic, as is the assignment of one IUI to two different individual entities. OYSTER is software that can detect such errors in IUI assignment. Furthermore, OYSTER has a mode of operation that relies on tracking unique individual persons and addresses over time. It can thus be extended through Referent Tracking to track, and de-duplicate IUIs for, diseases, prescriptions, tumors, fractures, etc.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rtswithoyster", "_id": "516c5311c4d1040c690f953e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1565992, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Applying OYSTER to a Referent Tracking", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
