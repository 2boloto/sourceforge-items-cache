GKas can automatically detect and eliminate frame-shift mutations and premature stop-codons to compute the substitution rates (Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks) between a well-annotated genome and a non-annotated genome or even a non-well assembled scaffold data set. It is especially useful for the newly sequenced genomes that have not been well annotated yet. We applied GKas to estimate the substitution rates in five pairs of closely related species with one well-annotated genome and one non-annotated genome. The divergence times of five pair species inferred from GKas program are well consistent with previous estimation.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gkas", "_id": "5047b0cf1be1ce4cacd0dac1", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 884785, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "The pipeline for Genome level Ka/Ks calculation ", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
