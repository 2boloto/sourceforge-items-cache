In the filesystem the key is implemented as a 'name/version' subtree.\r\n\r\nSRCDB (util) is designed to:\r\n1) Populate its database with the data describing tarballs: name of the tarball, URLs of origin and contents checksums.\r\n2) Download and perform integrity checks of tarballs described by the database, given the database key.\r\n3) Inform other tools about location of a tarball in the local filesystem (or its absence), given the database key.\r\n\r\nSRCDB (util) is implemented as a shell-script for immediate availability.
