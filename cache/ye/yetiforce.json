Every function within the system was thought through and automated to ensure that all of them work together seamlessly and form a coherent integrity. We looked at the entire sales process and consequently refined the system, module by module. It is as easy to love, as it is easy to use. This new and innovative system will not only help to save time through efficient flow of information within your company, but it will also significantly increase the effectiveness of your employees. It is built on a rock-solid Vtiger foundation but has hundreds of changes that help to accomplish even the most challenging tasks in the simplest way. YetiForce is a system is fun to work with and soon becomes your best partner in acquiring new customers and increasing sales.\r\n\r\nGIT:\r\nhttps://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForce\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\nhttps://test.yetiforce.com\r\nhttps://test.yetiforce.com/portal/", "shortname": "yetiforce", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The best open system for Your business", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2324499}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "YetiForce mailing lists", "mount_point": "yetiforce", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "link", "name": "link"}, {"label": "GIT", "mount_point": "git", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/yetiforce/", "video_url": null}
