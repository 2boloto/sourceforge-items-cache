The interface is similar to other motion capture applications (e.g. Blender), but is more convenient in getting started with the 3-Space Sensor units since the application was created for them. It automatically searches for 3-Space Sensor units already in use by the computer on start-up of the application and can load in previous sessions that saved off 3-Space Sensor information. However, it can only set-up and record motion data. It cannot edit or clean-up the motion data like other motion capture applications. Do not sweat though, because the Mocap Studio can export its motion data using the BVH (Biovision Hierarchy) format which is a widely used form for motion capture data.", "shortname": "yeimocap", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A motion capture application utilizing the YEI 3-Space Sensor family.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 735241}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/yeimocap/", "video_url": ""}
