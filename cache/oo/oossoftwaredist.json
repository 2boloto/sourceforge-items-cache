This \"Shell\" is not yet standalone; Meaning, it uses some platform-dependent code, and requires the Bash shell to work properly. It currently is only available for mac, but any of you can compile it for your Linux machines. Included with this shell are 3 nonbuiltin programs, which you can install during the installation of the \"Operating System.\" OOS Mimics a UNIX Shell in every way I can think of, and acts as a little embedded Operating System. This, of course, allows for programs to be run. The nonbuiltin programs that I have developed and included include a game, a calculator, an encryption program, and another random program. This whole project was developed and maintained entirely by a 13-year-old. So enough of this description stuff! Download my program, try it out!", "shortname": "oossoftwaredist", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Various programs accessed through a shell developed by a teenager.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1272861}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/oossoftwaredist/", "video_url": ""}
