Your current client, Evan Smith, has set up a bank account under an alias. He has hired you to hack into the banks mainframe and funnel money from an account into the dummy account. The bank is privately owned meaning more security, heavily encrypted network connections, and strictly guarded accounts. You both stand to make millions.\r\n\r\n------- BUILDING -------\r\n\r\nInfiltrator is built with Visual C++ 2010. In the future there may be solutions for earlier versions of VC++ included with the source.\r\n\r\nYou must have the Boost C++ Library <http://www.boost.org/>. The Boost version Infiltrator is currently being tested with is 1.51.
