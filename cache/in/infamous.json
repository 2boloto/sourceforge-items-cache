I am NOT updating every day (I work 6 days a week and have a 22 month old and wife)... \r\n\r\n2. Don't ask for ETA, this is rude and offensive. When it is done it is done.\r\n\r\n3. Custom Roms come without warranty. They are tested before release but something always can go bad. So if you broke your phone or you got fired because the alarm didn't go off - I am not responsible.\r\n\r\n4. Support is limited. Sometimes I can answer your questions sometimes I don't have the time. There will be times I don't have an answer so please do no repeat your question or get offended because I haven't answered you. \r\n\r\n5. Don't compare ROMs. It is rude and offensive for developers. If the other rom has what you need, use that ROM.\r\n\r\n6. Don't Kang my work. You may fool everyone else but I will know! If you want to use something just ask!\r\n\r\n7. If you like my work, a five star thread rating and hitting the thanks button motivates me.
