The aim is to implement an interpreter driven not only by code typed at a command-line prompt, but also by a customisable GUI and keyboard interface. The user can perform routine tasks with a single mouse click or keyboard shortcut rather than having to type the entire line at the prompt. The interpreter interface can itself be modified at run-time by code that has been loaded into the environment and will be implemented with a read-eval-print loop. The interpreter will be written in the language of the code it runs.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet figured out what language I will use for the interpreter, but it will be based on a similar concept as Java's bytecode and the .NET Common Language Runtime. Code will run inside a virtual machine.\r\n\r\nThe interpreter will store both code and data in special data files and you can save and restore sessions (like hibernating/sleeping Windows).", "shortname": "interpretergui", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "GUI-based and keyboard-driven rather than text-based interpreter", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 635928}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/interpretergui/", "video_url": ""}
