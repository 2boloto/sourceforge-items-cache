The aim is to implement an interpreter driven not only by code typed at a command-line prompt, but also by a customisable GUI and keyboard interface. The user can perform routine tasks with a single mouse click or keyboard shortcut rather than having to type the entire line at the prompt. The interpreter interface can itself be modified at run-time by code that has been loaded into the environment and will be implemented with a read-eval-print loop. The interpreter will be written in the language of the code it runs.\r\n\r\nI haven't yet figured out what language I will use for the interpreter, but it will be based on a similar concept as Java's bytecode and the .NET Common Language Runtime. Code will run inside a virtual machine.\r\n\r\nThe interpreter will store both code and data in special data files and you can save and restore sessions (like hibernating/sleeping Windows).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "interpretergui", "_id": "4ed0bf811be1ce231700037c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 635928, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "GUI-based and keyboard-driven rather than text-based interpreter", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Text Editors :: Integrated Development Environments (IDE)", "shortname": "ide", "fullname": "Integrated Development Environments (IDE)", "id": 65}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Interpreters", "shortname": "interpreters", "fullname": "Interpreters", "id": 49}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}]}}
