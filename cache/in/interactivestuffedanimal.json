It will have a microphone, a speaker, a camera, and touch and movement sensors. It will have a wi-fi connection to an administrator's dedicated, unconnected laptop, tablet, or cell phone as its display and means of data input. It will run on rechargeable batteries. The CPU will be a Raspberry Pi Model B+.\r\n\r\nSoftware will be ChatScript and other chatbot applications. User input and output will be by speech recognition and generation. An administrator will use a laptop or tablet for data input and monitoring of reports, etc. Data on the children will be maintained in the Cloud, as will logs of all non-housekeeping conversations and selected data mined from them. The robot will be controlled by speech recognition through the chatbot applications, which will use Raspbian, ROS, Botserver, and other applications.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "interactivestuffedanimal", "_id": "54c39cfaf1fd8d438c87056d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2398889, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Stuffed animal intended for children (prototype now under development)", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "id": 80}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 71}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Social sciences :: Psychology", "shortname": "psychology", "fullname": "Psychology", "id": 807}], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Healthcare Industry", "shortname": "healthcareindustry", "fullname": "Healthcare Industry", "id": 362}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: Spanish", "shortname": "spanish", "fullname": "Spanish", "id": 277}], "os": []}}
