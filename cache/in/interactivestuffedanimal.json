It will have a microphone, a speaker, a camera, and touch and movement sensors. It will have a wi-fi connection to an administrator's dedicated, unconnected laptop, tablet, or cell phone as its display and means of data input. It will run on rechargeable batteries. The CPU will be a Raspberry Pi Model B+.\r\n\r\nSoftware will be ChatScript and other chatbot applications. User input and output will be by speech recognition and generation. An administrator will use a laptop or tablet for data input and monitoring of reports, etc. Data on the children will be maintained in the Cloud, as will logs of all non-housekeeping conversations and selected data mined from them. The robot will be controlled by speech recognition through the chatbot applications, which will use Raspbian, ROS, Botserver, and other applications.\r\n", "shortname": "interactivestuffedanimal", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Stuffed animal intended for children (prototype now under development)", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2398889}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/interactivestuffedanimal/", "video_url": null}
