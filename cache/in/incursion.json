It is not our intent to rip off the original team of amazing designers so we are going to rebuild the game from the ground up, this will give us the same style of game but with a fresh feel and powerful engines. It is our goal to recreate the immersive atmosphere the original X-Com games had. It is our intention to create not only a visually stunning game but also an emotionally immersive atmosphere.
