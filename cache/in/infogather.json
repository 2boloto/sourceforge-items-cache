It's just something I found useful and I thought people could adapt to their needs without re-inventing the wheel.  What it does is gather a lot of information about the server it is run on, and puts it in an easy to use format.  It makes baseline documetnation easy, and managers happy.  I don't really know html and sort of picked pieces from one of our wikis to do that part so I take NO credit for any of the html.  I'd love it if someone better than me with that could help with formatting.  In the future I may add a mechanism for centralized up loads and accepting arguments for mass deployment.  I used mooty to deploy it and run it (I love mooty and highly recommend you check it out.)
