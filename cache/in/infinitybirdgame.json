I did some research on these two problems and came up with a conclusion, Flappy Bird is missing three elements, the first being there was no way of users to customise the game, the second being there was no sense of achievement once you completed the game, and the third being the game didn't have a list of achievements or goals to complete! After a while of research I decided to do my part in this research and patch these problems up with Infinity Bird! The game is at very early stages, and I am still working on it. \r\nMy goal is to create an immersive experience of a 2D game for players. You can download and view Infinity Bird\u2019s files and plans on our website which should be above the description.
