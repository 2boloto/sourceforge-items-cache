Thanks to InTime, researchers, developers and companies can share their tools and resources with very little effort, without having to adapt neither API or data models.\r\nMoreover, the integration with InTime platform does not imply the lose of control of the integrated tools and resources, because users do not have direct access to them. InTime builds a distributed network where each resource supplier decides which tools can be used and how. In addition, these tools can be executed remotely as they are installed in users' local machines, as well as it is possible to know which tools and resources are integrated in the platform.\r\nThis platform is especially suitable for research processes, in order to share and combine research tools and resources between researchers, and test the best combinations of these tools without having to install none of them.", "shortname": "intimeplatform", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Language Technologies Integrating Platform", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1839912}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/intimeplatform/", "video_url": ""}
