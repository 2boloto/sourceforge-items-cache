Many variable values could be separated from the code and processed first at runtime through command line arguments. \r\n\r\nSome relations among these variables could exist, e.g. the presence of an argument could depend on the value of another argument. In this way, simple solutions would not be practical from a software Engineering point of view.  \r\n\r\nThis software is used for providing an efficient alternative for providing command lines in an organized structured way. Using this software, one is able to quickly implement a set of related menus. Each menu consists of a set of related flags,  the existence of a flag depends on the value of another. The existence of a menu may also depend on the value of a certain flag or the consistency of inputs of other menus. \r\n\r\nA user of this software would use the code for his applications. Together with Emacs editor, processing of menus and flags can be done interactively.
