Patricia Tries are used for storing the words from the data files and Skip lists are used to keep track of all the documents in which the word occurred by storing the document id's. The query is taken as input from which the keywords are extracted and searched in the trie data structure. The all the skiplists against the words are take and an intersection of them provides the document id's in which all the keywords have co-occurred. Then these document id's names are provided to the user. \r\nThe datastructure created gives a high performance with really fast searches.", "shortname": "invertdindexing", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 894650}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/invertdindexing/", "video_url": ""}
