As more people use and release such adaptations, Ingen will become increasingly portable. On top of this, Ingen's entire architecture is strictly plugin based, and the modular nature of the plugins allows them to inter-operate even when written in different languages. It also is independent of any one  server language, and provides the speed and efficiency expected of any AJAX application.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ingenwebplatform", "_id": "531237d7bcf63a2e6241ff71", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2120058, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}], "summary": "An in-development AJAX-based web platform", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
