All of this being in order to bring about the dissolution of an opposing power.\r\n\r\nGameplay consists of a top-down perspective of your ship in 2D, with the original Dungeon Master gameplay system for boarding vessels with a party of assault droids.\r\n\r\nYou may customize the droids and ship, plus research weapons and new parts.  Weapons may be independently targeted, and it is possible to utilize anti-munition weapons during defense.  Captured ships can be added to your fleet, and other AI players may join the cause.\r\n\r\nThis project is currently pre-alpha, but preliminary code can be compiled to give the test environment with currently implemented functions.
