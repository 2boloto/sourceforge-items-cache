You can set Alerts, a lower alert to warn you it's dropping in price and an upper alert to let you know it hit your selling point. A sound will play when this occurs and there will be a popup as well. Clicking on the symbol name will launch the web browser of your choice ( Internet explorer [default], Firefox, Chrome, or Opera ) It saves all of this information between sessions so the next time you launch it you can hop right back into the action.
