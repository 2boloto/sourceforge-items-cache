You are the @ in the map. The numbers are robot enemies. They each obey to a signal channel (indicated by their number). If any of the robot touches you the game is over. You goal is to destroy them all. Each turn you move a slot and send out a signal. The signal send out is in form of \"number + direction\". The robots in that number will move towards that direction. Robots didn't receive signal will move randomly. If two robots hit each other they will both die. If a robot his the wall(*) or edge three times it will also die.
