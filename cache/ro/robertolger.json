Perfumer Philippe Bousseton created this floral and fruity cocktail inspired by Aphrodite. With its freshness Davidoff Cool Water Wave reminds you of pure, crystal water. It starts with summer notes: juicy, fresh and sweet watermelon that blends with the notes of passionate fruits: mango and guava with floral accords of freesia, datura, pink pepper, peony and corn. In the base of this seductive fragrance there are sandalwood, iris and amber. This tear-shaped bottle was designed by Elie Papiernik. Its iridescent ocean blue colour seduces modern, elegant and sophisticated women all over the world. It is available in 30 ml, 50 ml and 100 ml bottles.\r\nhttp://shopping.rediff.com/product/davidoff-cool-water-wave-edt-spray-for-women---100-ml-/11429882", "shortname": "robertolger", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1072963}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/robertolger/", "video_url": ""}
