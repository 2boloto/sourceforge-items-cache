Operations such as composition, inversion, ZYX yaw extraction, fused yaw extraction, random generation, equality detection, vector rotation and much more have been implemented for each rotation representation. Unit tests for each function are provided to ensure that the library is performant.", "shortname": "rotationslib", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Library for working with 3D rotations in Matlab/Octave", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2357172}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rotationslib/", "video_url": null}
