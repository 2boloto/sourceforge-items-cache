A process primitive is a generic host class that inherits a \"process policy\". The process policy defines the specific behavior of a process primitive. The general term: \"process\" can refer to either one of these abstractions (I.e. \"2 processes connected in series\" may refer to 2 primitives, 2 systems, or one of each)\r\n\r\nNOTE: Route11 was written using many new C++11 features, so it is required that a C++11 compatible compiler (e.g Clang or GCC) is used when building this project.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "route11", "_id": "523d6ebbc431431a13480fac", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "link", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1958495, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "C++ Flow-Based Metaprogramming Library", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "shortname": "development", "fullname": "Software Development", "id": 45}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "id": 97}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
