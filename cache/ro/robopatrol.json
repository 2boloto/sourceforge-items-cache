The program simulates robots performing a task, such as patrolling an area for intruders or measuring environmental factors.  RoboPatrol allows students to design their own robot AIs in Java.  Students can then load their AIs into the graphical interface of RoboPatrol and observe the effectiveness of their AI designs.  RoboPatrol awards points to AIs for accomplishing the goals of the patrol simulation, so that robots' relative effectiveness in their task can be directly compared.\r\n\r\nNew patrol simulations can be implemented to create new goals for robot AIs, changing the points awarded for accomplishing tasks as well as the robots' ability to sense their environment.", "shortname": "robopatrol", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A competitive robotics simulation for the study of AI.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2111951}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/robopatrol/", "video_url": null}
