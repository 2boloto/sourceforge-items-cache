This includes responding to peoples questions by identifying their sentences using the bot's adequately powerful sentence parsing algorithim, logging a chatlog for a channel, or doing a number of things triggered by people saying something, including responding to their sentences using tagged phrases from what they said, executing IO actions (an example would be storing some variable and tagging it to the user who spoke, such as a status), retreiving data from the outside world or a log file, and integrating it simply into what the bot says. Besides all this and more, the bot's behaviour is easily customizable because all its responses are stored in a simple to read \"personality file\" that can be edited with your favorite text editor. In short, if you want a simple to maintain irc bot that can do everything you want and more, try out RoboDuck and see if it fits the task.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "roboduck", "_id": "500c8808b9363c549800005e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 831513, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A simple yet powerful configurable irc bot", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
