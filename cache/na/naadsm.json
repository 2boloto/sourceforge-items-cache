User-established parameters define model behavior in terms of disease progression; disease spread by animal-to-animal contact, contact with contaminated personnel or equipment, and airborne dissemination; and the implementation of control measures such as vaccination and depopulation.  Resources available to implement disease control strategies are taken into consideration.  The model records a wide variety of measures of the extent of simulated outbreaks and other characteristics.  The graphical interface and output visualization features also make it a useful tool for training and preparedness exercises.  NAADSM has been developed with broad international support, is now being used to evaluate outbreak scenarios and potential control strategies for economically important animal diseases in many countries around the world.", "shortname": "naadsm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A framework for simulating the spread and control of animal diseases", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1886414}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code (git)", "mount_point": "git", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/naadsm/", "video_url": ""}
