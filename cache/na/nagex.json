The PHP script pulls the data for your internal/external company users to view infrastructure status information without giving them access to the CGI interface. This project can be easily integrated inside of your existing intranet using a PHP include or iframe for a custom look and feel since it does not have navigation or links. It utilizes the $HOSTALIAS$ so users do not see internal server names. If you want to display information about every host/service checked by Nagios, simply define the event_handler in your host and service templates instead of individual host and service definitions.\r\n\r\nNagex was my November 2011 project and is a modified version of another project called Nagdash, which was originally developed by John Kenyon. His website is no longer functional and hasn't responded to my emails. Hope he's ok. I found the original project on the Nagios Exchange.", "shortname": "nagex", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Nagios external infrastructure host/service status display", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 793326}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/nagex/", "video_url": ""}
