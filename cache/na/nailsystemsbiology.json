NAIL includes methods for creating networks, analysing and comparing networks, and for visualising or presenting the results. These methods are designed as self-contained platform-independent components which can be called either from another program, or from a command line.\r\n\r\nModelling biological systems as networks (graphs) is becoming a common approach in the life sciences.  However, different algorithms typically use different input and output data types, are implemented using different technologies, and are demonstrated by application to different biological problems. Because of this, the primary goal of the NAIL project is to provide a straightforward way to use network approaches in the life sciences, and to apply a variety of techniques quickly and easily on the same data.
