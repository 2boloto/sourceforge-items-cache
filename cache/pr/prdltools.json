The scope of the language is to encompass clauses from data protection legislation and enterprise privacy policies in order to e.g. derive data access decisions automatically based on the enterprise privacy policies (EPPs). There have been many initiatives for expressing privacy rules and legal restrictions into a computable way. The attempt of PRDL is to present a collaborative result towards a multistakeholder language. The goal was that PRDL should be sufficiently expressive to define EPPs for SMEs, it should link the wording of the data privacy laws of different European countries, and it should be represented in natural language and therefore should be easy to understand. Additionally it should be able to express the workflows that have to be conducted within the helping wizards. After all, it should be automatically or semi automatically executable by a rule engine.", "shortname": "prdltools", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Privacy Rule Definition Language to write Enterprise Privacy Policies", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 761488}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/prdltools/", "video_url": ""}
