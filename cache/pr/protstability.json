Sequence- and structure-based programs on protein stability exist which relies only on single point mutations and sequence optimality. The energy distribution conferred by each amino acid essentially paves way for understanding protein stability. To the best of our knowledge, Protein Stability is a first program of its kind, developed to explore the energy requirement of each amino acid in the protein sequence derived from various applied kinetic and thermodynamic quantities. The algorithm is strongly dependent both on kinetic quantities such as atomic solvation energies and solvent accessible surface area and thermodynamic quantities viz. enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, etc. The hydrophobicity pattern of protein was considered as the important component of protein stabilization.
