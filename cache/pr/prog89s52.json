Atmel's 89S are programmable via an SPI port and therefore require absolutely no additional components in order to program them in-system. \r\n\r\nThis program requires a standard \"Centronics\" type PC parallel port (a bidirectional, EPP or ECP port is not required). A 5-way cable is required to connect the microcontroller to the port; wiring information is given in the included manual page.\r\nRemember that a clock source is required in order to program the device, and that EA must be tied to Vcc when programming the internal flash memory.\r\n\r\nNote that since prog89S52 uses ioperm() and friends to access the underlying port hardware, you may need to run it as root. \r\n\r\nBoth binary and source may be freely distributed and modified, but both are provided without any form of express or implied warranty.", "shortname": "prog89s52", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Utility for programming an AT89S52 via a parallel port.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1953115}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/prog89s52/", "video_url": ""}
