Mellon Foundation, and began technology development in October 2010 after an 18-month planning phase involving more than a hundred universities in the U.S., Europe, and Australia. The Bamboo Technology Project (BTP) involved ten campuses. The BTP adapted research environments for humanities scholars; and developed/adopted infrastructure, with a focus on federated IAM, to allow librarians and technologists to better support humanities scholarship across institutions of higher education. The code artifacts of the consortial project have been moved here, to sourceforge, from a self-hosted code repository. An issue tracker (JIRA) is hosted by Atlassian OnDemand at https://projectbamboo.atlassian.net; Bamboo's wiki archive is hosted at UC Berkeley, https://wikihub.berkeley.edu/display/pbamboo. These migrations were undertaken as grant support ramped down, to permit Bamboo's work to move forward.", "shortname": "projectbamboo", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@projectbamboo", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Applications and shared infrastructure for humanities research.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1357152}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/projectbamboo/", "video_url": ""}
