It was developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for modeling stellar coronagraphs, but it can be applied to other optical systems were diffraction propagation is of concern. It is currently available for IDL (Interactive Data Language) with a Matlab version in development and a Python version planned. It includes routines for generating complex apertures and obscurations and aberrations (Zernike & PSD-defined). It includes a model of a deformable mirror for wavefront control. The routines perform near and far field propagation with automatic selection of propagators.\r\n\r\nThe latest version is v2.0a released on 3 March 2015.
