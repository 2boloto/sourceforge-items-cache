The software includes a number of scalable triple store implementations built on top of NoSQL products (Hbase, Accumulo, Solr, Cassandra, etc.). It also includes support for implementing statement-level security over arbitrary triple store implementations. Linked data and SPARQL endpoint support is also included in a Java-based web application.\r\n\r\nThe  package can be used in different ways. You can use the individual libraries in your own solution or you can use the out-of-the-box web application to speed implementation. The software is meant to function as both a set of building blocks and as a cohesive unit. The choice of how to leverage the building blocks is left to the application developer.", "shortname": "prism-framework", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Semantic web library collection and publication framework.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 680831}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/prism-framework/", "video_url": ""}
