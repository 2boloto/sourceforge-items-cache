There will be numerous Graphs that will display real time data, this will gives users data to use for their own personal use...There will also be a a chat engine built in, there will be no illegal use of file transfers or other illegal data. Embedded Device Such as the Arduino Embedded Ethernet Controller will also be used..User will also be able to create data graphs based on their findings and share with other users on the peep to peer network, videos and files of certain will reviewed by the scientific community, other tools that will also be incorporated for future versions of this project, frequency-analysis and various test instruments that are used in every day work environments.", "shortname": "processorpp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Scientific Peer to Peer Networking", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 701509}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/processorpp/", "video_url": ""}
