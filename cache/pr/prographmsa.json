This is achieved by incorporating a graph-based sequence representation as in POA and combines it with the advantages of the phylogeny-aware algorithm in Prank. Further, we account for variations in the substitution pattern by using estimated amino acid frequencies and by implementing context-specific profiles as in CS-Blast.\r\nThe latest versions of ProGraphMSA include and extension to the alignment model to support tandem repeat unit insertions and deletions.", "shortname": "prographmsa", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Graph-based multiple sequence alignment", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1188829}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/prographmsa/", "video_url": ""}
