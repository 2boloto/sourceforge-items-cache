The downloadable content involves visual studio code, which can be manipulated according to custom need of your deployement. I will shortly write a wiki to demonstrate how to use this code. Presently in this application one can pack his or her data in a self extracting archive. I welcome any kind of modifications in this code or documentation. Ultimate aim of this project is to replace commercial sfx installers for windows with a free .net based tool. An important thing to be noted at this time is that this tools relies on codeDOM and Reflection namespaces. One can learn concept of these with the code presented here.
