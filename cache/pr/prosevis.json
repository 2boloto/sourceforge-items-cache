Mellon Foundation through a grant titled \"SEASR Services,\" in which we seek to identify other features than the \"word\" to analyze texts. These features comprise sound including parts-of-speech, accent, phoneme, stress, tone, break index.\r\n\r\nProseVis allows a reader to map the features extracted from OpenMary (http://mary.dfki.de/) Text-to-speech System and predictive classification data to the \"original\" text. We developed this project with the ultimate goal of facilitating a reader's ability to analyze and disseminate the results in human readable form. Research has shown that mapping the data to the text in its original form allows for the kind of human reading that literary scholars engage: words in the context of phrases, sentences, lines, stanzas, and paragraphs. \r\n\r\nDownloads include: ProseVis.jar (executable) and TestDocuments.zip (including Tender Buttons and the New England Cook Book)", "shortname": "prosevis", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "ProseVis is a visualization tool for analyzing the sound of text.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 619173}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/prosevis/", "video_url": ""}
