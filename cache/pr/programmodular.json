MODULAR reads a set of text files with bipartite or adjacency binary matrices representing networks. The software can identify and define modules by two different modularity metrics widely used in studies with different types of networks such as social, ecological and biochemical networks. In order to find the network partition that maximizes modularity, the software offers five optimization methods to the user: simulated annealing, fast greedy, spectral partitioning, a hybrid of fast greedy and simulated annealing, and a hybrid of spectral partitioning and simulated annealing. The software is implemented in C language and it uses the igraph library for complex network research.", "shortname": "programmodular", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "MODULAR: Autonomous Computation of Modularity", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 845179}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/programmodular/", "video_url": ""}
