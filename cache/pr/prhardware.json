It shows that control systems benefit from hardware concurrency, meaning that by moving the control intelligence into hardware, the negative effects inherent to threads and their scheduler are minimized. This leaves software with the role of a high-level administrator rather than an executor, thereby eliminating unnecessary bottlenecks. The tools described in this project enable the hardware engineer to develop DPR-FPGA systems more effectively for rapid control system development.\r\n\r\nFor more information, related papers and user guide, please refer to:\r\n- https://sourceforge.net/p/prhardware/wiki/Home/\r\n- http://www2.ensc.sfu.ca/research/iDEA/personel/victor_lesau.htm\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "prhardware", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Framework for Adaptive Hardware Concurrent Systems with DPR-FPGAs", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 677943}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/prhardware/", "video_url": ""}
