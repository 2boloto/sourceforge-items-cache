BAaaS is intended to be a free cloud application that can assist in architecting the required business processes of any organization. It is based upon Martyn Ould's approach to creating a Process Architecture that reduces the traditional arbitrary nature of this effort. \r\n\r\nThe intent is to have organizations use the application to build/improve their needed processes. In so doing they will contribute/donate to the knowledge base of industry-categorized processes. A best practices subset will emerge. All components will be open source.    \r\n", "summary": "Assists in creating, improving organizations based on its processes.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 890857, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "baaas", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bpm4all/", "username": "bpm4all", "name": "Doug Scott"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://advinfo.sharepoint.com/Pages/default.aspx", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise :: Workflow", "fullname": "Workflow", "shortname": "workflow", "id": 641}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise :: Business Process Management", "fullname": "Business Process Management", "shortname": "processmanagement", "id": 748}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Knowledge Management", "fullname": "Knowledge Management", "shortname": "knowledgemanagement", "id": 827}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Non-Profit Organizations", "fullname": "Non-Profit Organizations", "shortname": "nonprofit", "id": 618}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Management", "fullname": "Management", "shortname": "management", "id": 725}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Virtualization", "fullname": "Virtualization", "shortname": "virtualization", "id": 664}]}}
