BAaaS is intended to be a free cloud application that can assist in architecting the required business processes of any organization. It is based upon Martyn Ould's approach to creating a Process Architecture that reduces the traditional arbitrary nature of this effort. \r\n\r\nThe intent is to have organizations use the application to build/improve their needed processes. In so doing they will contribute/donate to the knowledge base of industry-categorized processes. A best practices subset will emerge.
