When you're finished playing, a compressed backup of the save data will be automatically created in a location you've specified, such as a cloud folder, network folder or external drive.\r\n\r\nIf you use Game Backup Monitor on multiple computers and share the same backup folder, you can effectively add cloud save support to any game or application. GBM can notify you of new save games to be restored when you move to each computer.\r\n\r\nGame Backup Monitor was designed with classic DRM-free gaming in mind, but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!\r\n\r\nUse the website link below for information about recent updates.", "summary": "A system tray application to automate save game backups.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2303412, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@GameBackupMon", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "backupmonitor", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mikemaximus/", "username": "mikemaximus", "name": "Michael J.
