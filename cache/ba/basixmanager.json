The idea to come is that some games run in steam don't always have intended save backups, furthermore, most users have more games than just steam (e.g. ZSNES for an emulator and urbanterror, maybe even steam in wine, etc.) and the user either wants to back up those saves / entire games up TO somewhere.  Basix will search some standard folders for the user's games (.steam, .wine, POLfolders, etc.) and ask the user what other folders to add.  Save files and game files will be labeledph4nt0m117 in their own tabs and set to be able to be compressed into a zip on the desktop so the user can put the file on a hard drive.  The larger goal is to integrate a web browser, or at the very least a tool like megasync, to upload files to secure sites.\r\n\r\nAs the program develops there will be changes regularly made.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "basixmanager", "_id": "5539d57dc4d10409ea5876b5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2450828, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
