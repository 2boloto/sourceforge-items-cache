Just post in the discussions page. :)\r\n\r\n*The windows based editor is written using BlitzMax, and uses a slightly edited version of a module (wxMax) created by a BlitzMax user called Brucey: https://code.google.com/p/maxmods/\r\n\r\nThe module in question is contained in the download under wxMax...
