Since I have to work in Windows at work  :-( I was looking for a similar tool in the MS world. You can find a number of battery monitoring programs for MS Windows, which give you a plethora of (useless) information - or do not work at all. Finally I decided to make one of my own (the world waited for that so badly!). And here it is.\r\nSince I did not want to restrict it to Windows only I made it a GTK application, which is cross platform portable. I created the low level data gathering functions for both Windows and Linux. You are very welcome to add additional ports (e.g. BSD or whatever).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "batterycat", "_id": "4eaed91cb9363c73890009f9", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 618655, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Battery monitoring and health tool.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Benchmark", "shortname": "benchmark", "fullname": "Benchmark", "id": 138}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: GTK+", "shortname": "ui_gtk", "fullname": "GTK+", "id": 477}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Win2K", "shortname": "mswin_2000", "fullname": "Win2K", "id": 420}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: FreeBSD", "shortname": "freebsd", "fullname": "FreeBSD", "id": 203}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: WinXP", "shortname": "mswin_xp", "fullname": "WinXP", "id": 419}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Win98 :: Win98 OSR2", "shortname": "mswin_98_osr2", "fullname": "Win98 OSR2", "id": 425}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: WinME", "shortname": "mswin_me", "fullname": "WinME", "id": 424}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
