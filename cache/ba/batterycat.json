Since I have to work in Windows at work  :-( I was looking for a similar tool in the MS world. You can find a number of battery monitoring programs for MS Windows, which give you a plethora of (useless) information - or do not work at all. Finally I decided to make one of my own (the world waited for that so badly!). And here it is.\r\nSince I did not want to restrict it to Windows only I made it a GTK application, which is cross platform portable. I created the low level data gathering functions for both Windows and Linux.
