Windows 8 apps cannot acces system information including the device battery life. However if the device is running on an intel based system then a windows forms application can be set to run in the system tray that will read the device power settings and battery percentage and write the information to a file.\r\n\r\nNext a windows 8 app can be set up to read the file on a timer and update the live tile with the new battery information.\r\n\r\nProblems: as of now i can't set up a backround task in the windows 8 app that will read a local file. So as of yet the app just has a button that will update the live tile with the new information", "shortname": "batterylifelive", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Displays the device battery percentage in a live tile on win 8", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1180537}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/batterylifelive/", "video_url": ""}
