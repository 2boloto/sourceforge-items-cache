Windows 8 apps cannot acces system information including the device battery life. However if the device is running on an intel based system then a windows forms application can be set to run in the system tray that will read the device power settings and battery percentage and write the information to a file.\r\n\r\nNext a windows 8 app can be set up to read the file on a timer and update the live tile with the new battery information.\r\n\r\nProblems: as of now i can't set up a backround task in the windows 8 app that will read a local file. So as of yet the app just has a button that will update the live tile with the new information", "summary": "Displays the device battery percentage in a live tile on win 8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1180537, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "batterylifelive", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/scoobah36/", "username": "scoobah36", "name": "AJ Danelz"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
