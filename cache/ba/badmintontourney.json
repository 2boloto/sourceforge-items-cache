Include match schedule conflict gestion and court availability. Since it is a excel workbook,  everyone with spreadsheet experience can use it easily \r\n\r\nI'm looking for people to test and comment on the application.  And hopefully collaborator with programming skills to help me with new features I cannot implement. As you will see by looking at the code, I'm no programmer and everything was done mostly by copy/past chunk of code found on tutorial website. Still I think the result is nice and it make for a really efficient program. \r\n\r\nWhat the program is lacking most currently is versatility. I tailored it for my type of tournament but it would be nice to implement more tournament format. \r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "badmintontourney", "_id": "5284e1e7c431431aca0cd82f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2007484, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A badminton tournament planner spreadsheet", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "id": 80}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)", "shortname": "visualbasicforapplications", "fullname": "Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)", "id": 838}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V3.0", "shortname": "ccaslv3", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V3.0", "id": 870}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Plugins :: Excel", "shortname": "excel", "fullname": "Excel", "id": 837}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Non-Profit Organizations", "shortname": "nonprofit", "fullname": "Non-Profit Organizations", "id": 618}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: French", "shortname": "french", "fullname": "French", "id": 276}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
