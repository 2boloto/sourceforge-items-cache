BatchOS aims at making a much easier programming language. It combines standard batch scripts with many more feature-granting applications. It uses DOS as a central platform in which we plan building on. Right now I am alone. Please join our(my) dev team! Together we can make programming easy! If your like me and can't program worth a crap then this is one of the things you will love. At the moment it is still a concept but work is actively being done on it but I can't do this alone!
