For instance, comprehensive species distribution datasets from wide geographic areas over the Central Baltic Sea region are being built and made publicly available.\r\n\r\nContents of this site are working drafts and available under GNU General Public License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)\r\n", "summary": "Towards transboundary access of nature observation data.
