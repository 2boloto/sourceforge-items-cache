Each pixel's brightness is its own dimension. Bayesian nodes have exactly 3 childs because that is all thats needed to do NAND in a fuzzy way as Bayes' Rule which is NAND at certain extremes. NAND can be used to create any logical system. In this early version, I'm still working on edge detection and its understanding of the same shapes at different brightnesses.
