You paint with the mouse into its dreams and it responds by changing what you painted gradually. There will also be an API for using it with other programs as a general high-dimensional space. Each pixel's brightness is its own dimension. Bayesian nodes have exactly 3 childs because that is all thats needed to do NAND in a fuzzy way as Bayes' Rule which is NAND at certain extremes. NAND can be used to create any logical system. In this early version, I'm still working on edge detection and its understanding of the same shapes at different brightnesses. This will be a module of the bigger Human AI Net project and will be used for adding realtime intuitive high dimensional intelligence in audio and visual interactions with the user.", "summary": "simple algorithm for a realtime interactive visual cortex for painting", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 742105, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bayesiancortex", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/benrayfield/", "username": "benrayfield", "name": "BenRayfield"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bayesiancortex/screenshot/bayesiancortex%200.1.1.JPG", "caption": "In version 0.1.1 still trying to get edge detection and brightness working", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bayesiancortex/screenshot/bayesiancortex%200.1.1.JPG/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bayesiancortex/screenshot/bayesiancortex%200.1.4.jpg", "caption": "Version 0.1.4, red green and blue show different properties of each pixel node, which are leaf nodes and are connected by 3-way nodes.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bayesiancortex/screenshot/bayesiancortex%200.1.4.jpg/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bayesiancortex/screenshot/bayesiancortex%200.1.5.jpg", "caption": "Version 0.1.5 decays bayesian weights toward mostly prediction of each child based on the other 2 childs, for each of 3 childs.
