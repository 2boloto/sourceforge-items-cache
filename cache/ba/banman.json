Views must take place within a customizable grace period.\r\n\r\nA perm-ban ever-bans an IP address by detecting any FURTHER violation within that same grace period.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of both the 'temp-ban' and the 'forever-ban' are completely automated. \r\n\r\nThe ability to personally manage / view banishment activity is also included (banman.php.)\r\n\r\nA web site in its own right, Banman also includes over 500 customizable, 'protectable' quotations (index_example.php).
