It is a hunt game. It uses an Alquerque board, and therefore, Bagh bandi is specifically a tiger hunt game (or tiger game). There are two tigers attempting to elude and capture as many goats while the goats are attempting to surround and trap the tigers. An interesting and uncommon feature in this game is that the goats are piled up on four points of the board at the beginning of the game. Piling up pieces is an unusual feature in hunt games or any board game in general. The only other hunt game that uses this feature is Sher-bakar, a game closely related to Bagh bandi.", "summary": "Bagh Bandi - 2 player board game ", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1066155, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "bagh-bandi", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/sabuj-das/", "username": "sabuj-das", "name": "Sabuj Das"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bagh-bandi/screenshot/01.PNG", "caption": "New Game", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bagh-bandi/screenshot/01.PNG/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bagh-bandi/screenshot/02.PNG", "caption": "Capture Goat", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bagh-bandi/screenshot/02.PNG/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://sourceforge.net/p/bagh-bandi", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "id": 471}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Multiplayer", "fullname": "Multiplayer", "shortname": "multiplayer", "id": 774}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "fullname": "Education", "shortname": "education", "id": 360}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
