There are no complicated equations to write: all the models are predefined! This version is a great tool for first time users and students interested in learning about synapses, as well as for studying geometry and distribution hypotheses in a 2D rectangular geometry.\r\n\r\nThis platform consists of a graphical interface in which elements that comprise a single glutamatergic synapse (both pre- and post-synaptically), their behavior as well as the underlying synaptic geometry can be modified. For example, EONS offers the ability to study the effect of voltage-gated calcium channels density and distribution, the number and location of receptors and more.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "eons", "_id": "55435bf30910d45032dc575f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2455170, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Elementary Objects of the Nervous System", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
