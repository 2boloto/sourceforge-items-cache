There are no complicated equations to write: all the models are predefined! This version is a great tool for first time users and students interested in learning about synapses, as well as for studying geometry and distribution hypotheses in a 2D rectangular geometry.\r\n\r\nThis platform consists of a graphical interface in which elements that comprise a single glutamatergic synapse (both pre- and post-synaptically), their behavior as well as the underlying synaptic geometry can be modified. For example, EONS offers the ability to study the effect of voltage-gated calcium channels density and distribution, the number and location of receptors and more.", "shortname": "eons", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Elementary Objects of the Nervous System", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2455170}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/eons/", "video_url": null}
