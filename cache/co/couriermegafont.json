(Courier Prime comes very close, but they settled on a weight that is too heavy for my likes.)\r\n\r\nAn included semi-condensed RS variant will fit more words on a page for necessarily information-heavy screenplays (e.g. science-fiction).\r\n\r\nThe name \"Mega\" is an \"adversarial\" nod to \"Courier Prime\"--as if this font could even be the Megatron to their \"Optimus Prime\"!
