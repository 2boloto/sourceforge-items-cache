Whether it was cooking a meal for myself, washing my own clothes or just doing the dishes, my mother did not want me to be one of those guys who had to depend on either her, or some poor woman later in life. By the time I left my mothers house at 15, I was capable of maintaining a home like a fifty year old. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of other guys in the world who can, or will for that matter, even attempt doing any housework. That's mainly because pride plays a huge role and Jeff doesn't want to look like a fool bumbling around the house wondering which bottle of fluid gets poured into the washing machine first. So, for those days you find yourself in your home,a mess in every room, kids hungry and no backup coming until rush hour, have no fear. These are my quickest, easiest and most efficient ways to flip that sloppy home over to immaculate, ENJOY!!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cookcleanlaundrylikealady", "_id": "5311ea8581b24b52befbb437", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2119708, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "For those emergency days when mommy is out sick or working late!", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
