A SoC design consists of multiple IP cores (logic, memory, analog, high speed I/O interfaces, RF, etc.) which generally use different technologies. SoC test is the appropriate combination of test solutions associated with individual cores. Cost modelling plays a vital role in reduction of test cost and time to market. This Matlab based cost estimation tool takes into consideration the various parameters and mathematical relations on account of Logic Built in Self Test (LBIST) and Memory Built in Self Test (MBIST). VLSI test engineers can take the benefit of this GUI based cost estimation tools for better test planning.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "costmodeling", "_id": "5244fe3b85540d74086989b6", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1964434, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Matlab based Cost Modeling Tool for SoC Testing", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Electronic Design Automation (EDA)", "shortname": "eda", "fullname": "Electronic Design Automation (EDA)", "id": 246}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Test and Measurement", "shortname": "testmeasure", "fullname": "Test and Measurement", "id": 825}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
