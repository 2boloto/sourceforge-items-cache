Controls and displays often fail to meet the requirements of users with visual, hearing, mobility or dexterity impairments.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for mainstream manufacturers to have a detailed understanding of these needs and how to design for them. Manufacturers would benefit from the support of a third party solution to input the necessary knowledge.\r\n\r\nVICON aims to provide this support through the development of an advanced Virtual User Model which will enable virtual testing and feedback throughout the development lifecycle.\r\n\r\nDocumentation: http://vicon-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vicon-Toolset1.pdf\r\n", "shortname": "convic", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Framework for product designers of accessible product interfaces", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1765099}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/", "video_url": ""}
