Controls and displays often fail to meet the requirements of users with visual, hearing, mobility or dexterity impairments.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for mainstream manufacturers to have a detailed understanding of these needs and how to design for them. Manufacturers would benefit from the support of a third party solution to input the necessary knowledge.\r\n\r\nVICON aims to provide this support through the development of an advanced Virtual User Model which will enable virtual testing and feedback throughout the development lifecycle.\r\n\r\nDocumentation: http://vicon-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Vicon-Toolset1.pdf\r\n", "summary": "Framework for product designers of accessible product interfaces", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1765099, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "convic", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/modzelew/", "username": "modzelew", "name": "Markus Modzelewski"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/ConVic_knowledge.png", "caption": "Knowledge Base lets you change the ontology (User: vicon, Password: nociv)", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/ConVic_knowledge.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/ConVic_new.png", "caption": "ConVic Main Window", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/ConVic_new.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/ConVic_treeview.png", "caption": "TreeView of the initial ontology without inference", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/ConVic_treeview.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/cad_anno_phone.png", "caption": "Annotation view of the Siemens NX integrated module", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/cad_anno_phone.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/Convic_onereco_new.png", "caption": "Single Recommendation View", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/convic/screenshot/Convic_onereco_new.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "http://vicon-project.eu/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "fullname": "C#", "shortname": "csharp", "id": 271}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics :: 3D Modeling", "fullname": "3D Modeling", "shortname": "3dmodeling", "id": 109}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Enterprise :: Product lifecycle management (PLM)", "fullname": "Product lifecycle management (PLM)", "shortname": "plm", "id": 756}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Manufacturing", "fullname": "Manufacturing", "shortname": "manufacturing", "id": 365}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
