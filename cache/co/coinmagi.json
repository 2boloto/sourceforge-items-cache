Magi is de-centralized and operates with no central authority or banks. Anyone in the world can use a personal computer to issue coins. Coin release is carried out by a software-based minting process, operating through a concept based on Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake (II). By removing the competitive nature of minting, magi offers an even playing field for anyone looking to mine cryptocurrencies without expensive equipment. Magi is a unique digital currency distinguishing itself from other counterparties by its fairness, cost effective and efficient energy saving in maintaining its operation.", "summary": "An energy-efficient digital currency for online payment", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2386991, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/7EkAbPacS7c?rel=0", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "CoinMagi", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/CoinMagi", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "coinmagi", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/joelao/", "username": "joelao", "name": "Joe Lao"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://www.coinmagi.org", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
