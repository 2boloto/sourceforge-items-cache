Magi is de-centralized and operates with no central authority or banks. Anyone in the world can use a personal computer to issue coins. Coin release is carried out by a software-based minting process, operating through a concept based on Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake (II). By removing the competitive nature of minting, magi offers an even playing field for anyone looking to mine cryptocurrencies without expensive equipment. Magi is a unique digital currency distinguishing itself from other counterparties by its fairness, cost effective and efficient energy saving in maintaining its operation.", "shortname": "coinmagi", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "CoinMagi", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/CoinMagi", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An energy-efficient digital currency for online payment", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2386991}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/coinmagi/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/7EkAbPacS7c?rel=0"}
