As you traverse the levels, the code given to you changes, for example on level may require the player's character to follow a simple if statement while another level will have you traversing a loop until you satisfy a condition to break it. The game will give the player the enjoyment of a simple 2d side scroller with puzzle solving mechanics all the while teaching them the basic mechanics behind how operating code runs.
