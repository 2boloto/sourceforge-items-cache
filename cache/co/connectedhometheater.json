I already own a D-Link DIR-655; considering purchasing either a 2nd one or one of D-Link's AC models. I was told that this would enable me to do the following:\r\n\r\n1.  Running iTunes on my PC, I could view and control iTunes on my iPad Air and listen to music on home theater system.\r\n\r\n2. Would like to be able to control and view Amazon.com Prime and Amazon Personal Library video content instead of my Roku. Advantages are that I do searches easier with my iPad and still view HD content on home theater system.\r\n\r\nSupposedly, I can obtain these benefits merely by:\r\n\r\n1. Purchasing another router. I have already spoken to D-Link and the tech said I cannot do this.\r\n\r\n2.  Running ShairPort4w on my PC;\r\n\r\n3.  Wi-Fi linking my iPad to my PC.\r\n\r\nQuestions from me are:\r\n\r\n1.  Is this right? Possible?\r\n2.  Have I missed any steps?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nSteve/JazzEngineer (more Jazz)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "connectedhometheater", "_id": "544ac00624b0d966acac44a3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2350782, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "ShairPort4w to I/F iPad to PC to control home theater", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
