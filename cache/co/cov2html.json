(ii) COV2HTML, a visualization interface allowing a real-time analysis of data with selected criteria. Thus this interface offers a visualization of NGS mapping coverage data (DNA-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and TSS) performed in different prokaryotic organisms (bacteria, viruses...) or different experimental conditions (mutant versus wild type strains or different growth states\u2026) facilitating studies.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "cov2html", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A visualization and analysis tool of Bacterial NGS data for Biologists", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 755896}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cov2html/", "video_url": ""}
