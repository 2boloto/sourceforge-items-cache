Given a specified pattern length (P), this number of bases are chopped from the end of the FASTA sequence and used to pattern match in a FASTQ file (either fasta or fastq will work). When matches are found, the pattern and any preceeding sequence is removed, then the user defined k-mer length (L) is extracted from the remaining matches (from left to right). From these k-mers the frequency is then determined and the most frequent is selected as the best k-mer. The best k-mer is then concateneated to the original FASTA sequence and the next round begins.\r\n", "shortname": "contigoverlapwalking", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2114596}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/contigoverlapwalking/", "video_url": null}
