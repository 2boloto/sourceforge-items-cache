Given a specified pattern length (P), this number of bases are chopped from the end of the FASTA sequence and used to pattern match in a FASTQ file (either fasta or fastq will work). When matches are found, the pattern and any preceeding sequence is removed, then the user defined k-mer length (L) is extracted from the remaining matches (from left to right). From these k-mers the frequency is then determined and the most frequent is selected as the best k-mer. The best k-mer is then concateneated to the original FASTA sequence and the next round begins.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "contigoverlapwalking", "_id": "530b693824b0d90cd0b53e51", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2114596, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
