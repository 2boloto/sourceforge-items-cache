Scales linearly to any number of CPU cores. More scalable and memory efficient than mtmalloc, ptmalloc, Hoard, etc.\r\n\r\nAllocations are very fast, with no lock contention and the least memory waste of any other allocator. Concur is optimized especially for applications that make heavy use of memory allocation in a threaded environment, or that just want to make the best use of every ounce of available memory. Just plugs right into your existing application without modification!\r\n\r\nThe new 2.0 update includes a variety of new optimizations to make Concur even more memory efficient.", "shortname": "concur", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "An extremely scalable multithreaded drop-in malloc() replacement", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 190908}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/concur/", "video_url": ""}
