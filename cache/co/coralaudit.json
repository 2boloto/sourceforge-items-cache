This results in:\r\n\r\n- Linear working practices (only one person can work on a doc at one time)\r\n- No audit trail of who changed what\r\n- Need to transpose large amounts of data from one file to another resulting in data integrity issues and wasted labour\r\n- Unintuitive interface requires large amounts of training \r\n- No fixed process template and no way to ensure this has been followed\r\n\r\nCoral Audit solves this by replacing Excel with a Web2.0 application that resolves all of these issues. Opensource and utilising industry-standard enterprise software platforms, it is built from the ground up by practicing risk experts in financial services. The app is intuitive, secure and reduces man hours by >80% compared to the existing Excel approach.", "shortname": "coralaudit", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Opensource app to manage risk & controls in large finance institutions", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 624225}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/coralaudit/", "video_url": ""}
