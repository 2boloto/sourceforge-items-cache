This results in:\r\n\r\n- Linear working practices (only one person can work on a doc at one time)\r\n- No audit trail of who changed what\r\n- Need to transpose large amounts of data from one file to another resulting in data integrity issues and wasted labour\r\n- Unintuitive interface requires large amounts of training \r\n- No fixed process template and no way to ensure this has been followed\r\n\r\nCoral Audit solves this by replacing Excel with a Web2.0 application that resolves all of these issues. Opensource and utilising industry-standard enterprise software platforms, it is built from the ground up by practicing risk experts in financial services. The app is intuitive, secure and reduces man hours by >80% compared to the existing Excel approach.", "summary": "Opensource app to manage risk & controls in large finance institutions", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 624225, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "coralaudit", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/premiacapital/", "username": "premiacapital", "name": "Premia Capital"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
