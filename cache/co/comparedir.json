And later have trouble to find the few files you changed among all the others ? \r\nCompareDir does just that: it can compare 2 directories + subdirectories and you decide what files you want to keep, copy or delete.\r\nManual: point it at a MasterDir, a SlaveDir than \r\nclick \"Diff\" = show only the files that are available in only 1 directory-tree. \r\nOr click \"All\" = show all files in both directories.\r\nOr click \"Eq\" = show file only the files that are the same.\r\nNote the program cheqs FileName, FileSize, FileDate and (sub)directory. It does not compute md5 sums because that would make it extremely slow. Mind you i use this regular for directories with 2000 photos.\r\nBased on Python, pygobject and gtk3.\r\n+ Python-pillow if you want to compare 2 images.\r\nNo installation: \r\nuntar -xvzf CompareDir.tgz \r\nwhere you want and run.", "summary": "Tool to Compare 2 directories and handle the files.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 764617, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "comparedir", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/henkidefix/", "username": "henkidefix", "name": "henkidefix"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/comparedir/screenshot/screenshot-comparedir.png", "caption": "comparedir screenshot", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/comparedir/screenshot/screenshot-comparedir.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: GTK+", "fullname": "GTK+", "shortname": "ui_gtk", "id": 477}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "fullname": "Python", "shortname": "python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "id": 15}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage", "fullname": "Storage", "shortname": "storage", "id": 638}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "id": 253}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}]}}
