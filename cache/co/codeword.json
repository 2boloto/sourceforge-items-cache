Therefore to manage 26 symbols are only necessary 5 bits (2 raised to a power 5 = 32 different values).\r\n\r\nWord \u201chello\u201d -> 5 characters -> 5 bytes -> 5 x 8 bit = 40 bits. If it assigns the letter \u2018a\u2019 the value 1, 2 to the \u2018b\u2019 and so on. Then  3 first bits are useless.
