Hash is saved in and .md5 file compatible with md5sum. it has a gui and work on Linux and windows (the script should work even on Mac). Md5 is computed while reading so sources file are read only once. The executables have been created using pp : it creates an executable similar to an autoextract-zip with the script, the perl engine and all libraries.\r\nI'm using it under linux to copy GigaBytes files from ntfs internal hd  to ntfs external hd with an old atom eepc with 8.5MB/sec speed : is it good? With more powerful pc speeds are 3 times better.\r\nAdded ability to manage very long path (>260 char) under windows (under linux is default : magic linux!).
