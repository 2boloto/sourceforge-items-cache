A MUD(multi user dungeon) is  text base environment. Think World of Warcraft(or any other massively multiplayer online game) but text based.

To provide a platform for AI research that has robotic-like sensory limitations but doesn't actually require robotics.\r\n2. To provide a platform for undergraduate computer scientists to build relatively complex AI.\r\n3. To provide a set of agents that non-technical people can play around with and get a feel for how various AI techniques work.\r\n\r\nCoffeeMudForAI goals\r\n\r\n1. To provide a platform to study the non-robotic aspects of AI(AI Planning, inter-agent planning, muti-agent planning, Machine learning, etc.)\r\n2. To provide a game-like platform so people coming from the game AI world can contribute to AI research.\r\n", "summary": "CoffeeMudForAI is plaform to design AI in", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1591697, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "coffeemudforai", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/miiohau/", "username": "miiohau", "name": "steven"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "id": 460}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Multi-User Dungeons (MUD)", "fullname": "Multi-User Dungeons (MUD)", "shortname": "mud", "id": 86}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "id": 133}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "id": 235}]}}
