To provide a platform for AI research that has robotic-like sensory limitations but doesn't actually require robotics.\r\n2. To provide a platform for undergraduate computer scientists to build relatively complex AI.\r\n3. To provide a set of agents that non-technical people can play around with and get a feel for how various AI techniques work.\r\n\r\nCoffeeMudForAI goals\r\n\r\n1. To provide a platform to study the non-robotic aspects of AI(AI Planning, inter-agent planning, muti-agent planning, Machine learning, etc.)\r\n2. To provide a game-like platform so people coming from the game AI world can contribute to AI research.\r\n", "shortname": "coffeemudforai", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "CoffeeMudForAI is plaform to design AI in", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1591697}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/coffeemudforai/", "video_url": ""}
