A MUD(multi user dungeon) is  text base environment. Think World of Warcraft(or any other massively multiplayer online game) but text based. AI or artificial intelligence is the field that is interested in the creation of non-organic intelligence.\r\n\r\nMud AI platform goals\r\n\r\n1. To provide a platform for AI research that has robotic-like sensory limitations but doesn't actually require robotics.\r\n2. To provide a platform for undergraduate computer scientists to build relatively complex AI.\r\n3. To provide a set of agents that non-technical people can play around with and get a feel for how various AI techniques work.\r\n\r\nCoffeeMudForAI goals\r\n\r\n1. To provide a platform to study the non-robotic aspects of AI(AI Planning, inter-agent planning, muti-agent planning, Machine learning, etc.)\r\n2. To provide a game-like platform so people coming from the game AI world can contribute to AI research.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "coffeemudforai", "_id": "516ee87f7929e56ff076ee64", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1591697, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "CoffeeMudForAI is plaform to design AI in", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Multi-User Dungeons (MUD)", "shortname": "mud", "fullname": "Multi-User Dungeons (MUD)", "id": 86}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "id": 133}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
