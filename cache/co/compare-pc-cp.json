Direct summation is prohibitively expensive when M and N are large. We provide Fortran 90 code for two complementary treecode methods which reduce the cost. The standard particle-cluster treecode partitions the sources into an octree and applies a far-field approximation, while a recently developed cluster-particle treecode instead partitions the targets into an octree and applies a near-field approximation. Particle-cluster is faster when N >> M, and cluster-particle is faster when M >> N.\r\n\r\nReference: Boateng, H. A. and Krasny, R., J. Comput.
