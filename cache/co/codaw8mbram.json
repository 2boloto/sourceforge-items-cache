I do not play CoDs so the only thing I know about them is that it's a shooting game so I made a shooting game. I made it mostly on that saturday and sunday, when I decided to publish it I only added a kill counter and such. If it's needed then I can possibly optimize it (it's terribly optimized especially the network part...) and add some new features (I might even port it to WinForms or something like that if needed).", "summary": "This program is joking on a typo on Steam.
