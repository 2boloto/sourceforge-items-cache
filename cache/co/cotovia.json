Another speaker, free for non-commercial uses, is avaliable through external links (see the Blog section).\r\n\r\nCotovia has been developed by the University de Vigo and the center 'Ram\u00f3n Pi\u00f1eiro' for Research in Humanities, both in Galicia, Spain. Its development has involved a research group of linguists and engineers.\r\n\r\nCotov\u00eda has been developed as a research project, therefore most of the work has been focused on the most interesting aspects from a scientific point of view.
