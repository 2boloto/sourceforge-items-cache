For instance, one group of fonts might map Coptic letters \u0393\u03b3 to Latin keys Gg, while another group might map them to Latin keys Jj.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons for the user to opt for legacy rather than Unicode encodings.  Two deserve special mention.  First, there are certain marks used in Biblical and other textual criticism that do not appear in Unicode; second, it is far easier to type in a legacy encoding and then turn it into Unicode than to type directly in Unicode.\r\n\r\nThis package aims to act as a stepping stone to Unicode, by including several legacy fonts hard-coded to take advantage of the multiple encodings, as well as a UNIX shell script, in multiple shell languages, to transcode between these encodings.  All twelve encodings in wide use are supported. \r\n\r\nThe fonts in this package are compatible with many operating systems; the shell scripts support Mac and Linux (more soon).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "coptenc", "_id": "5453cb4cc4d10453978114f3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2354924, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "A full system for transcoding between legacy Coptic character sets.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Library", "shortname": "library", "fullname": "Library", "id": 581}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Languages", "shortname": "edlanguage", "fullname": "Languages", "id": 859}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Sleepycat License", "shortname": "sleepycat", "fullname": "Sleepycat License", "id": 302}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Solaris", "shortname": "sun", "fullname": "Solaris", "id": 207}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OpenBSD", "shortname": "openbsd", "fullname": "OpenBSD", "id": 205}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: FreeBSD", "shortname": "freebsd", "fullname": "FreeBSD", "id": 203}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: NetBSD", "shortname": "netbsd", "fullname": "NetBSD", "id": 204}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}]}}
