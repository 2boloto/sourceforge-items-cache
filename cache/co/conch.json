What Controlled Chaos does is encode streams of data into a subset of the ASCII character set. Specifically, Controlled Chaos encodes data in between base 2 and base 94 (there are 94 visible, non-whitespace characters in US_ASCII), using only the visible ASCII characters (no whitespace, no control characters). By default, ConCh streams will assume Base94 for its encoding unless specified other radix.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature non-power-of-two encodings, padding is normally necessary for handling the fractional digits (citation needed). Though in the encoder, I made sure there's no nasty little padding bytes. Fractional digits are accounted for by the nature of the encoding.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not go into my original motivations for why I needed Base94 specifically when Base64 was such a nice looking encoding, did I really need the 30 extra digits? I did.\r\n\r\nMade in Java 7.", "shortname": "conch", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1889914}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/conch/", "video_url": ""}
