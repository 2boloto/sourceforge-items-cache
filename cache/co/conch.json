What Controlled Chaos does is encode streams of data into a subset of the ASCII character set. Specifically, Controlled Chaos encodes data in between base 2 and base 94 (there are 94 visible, non-whitespace characters in US_ASCII), using only the visible ASCII characters (no whitespace, no control characters). By default, ConCh streams will assume Base94 for its encoding unless specified other radix.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature non-power-of-two encodings, padding is normally necessary for handling the fractional digits (citation needed). Though in the encoder, I made sure there's no nasty little padding bytes. Fractional digits are accounted for by the nature of the encoding.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not go into my original motivations for why I needed Base94 specifically when Base64 was such a nice looking encoding, did I really need the 30 extra digits? I did.\r\n\r\nMade in Java 7.", "summary": "", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1889914, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "conch", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/axoren/", "username": "axoren", "name": "Kevin Amaral"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
