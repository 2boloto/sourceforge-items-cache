Its unique holistic approach amalgamates quality management, process management, context management, and knowledge management and can thus provide support attuned to the current project situation and the engineer\u2019s context.\r\n\r\nOne key goal of CoSEEEK was to develop techniques so that applicable guidance can be provided to an engineer (a CoSEEEK user) in an automated way based on their current context (context-awareness); taking into account what activities they have done and are likely to do based on their process workflow (process-orientation) using a workflow engine; current quality risks and issues for the project (quality management) are taken into account; and knowledge such as guidance is provisioned (e.g., providing checklist items).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "coseeek", "_id": "4f8be51c1be1ce6f8f000450", "tools": [{"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 749493, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Context-aware Software Engineering Environment Event-driven Framework", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Quality Assurance", "shortname": "quality_assurance", "fullname": "Quality Assurance", "id": 565}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: CASE", "shortname": "case_tools", "fullname": "CASE", "id": 570}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Collaborative development tools", "shortname": "collaborative", "fullname": "Collaborative development tools", "id": 761}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "shortname": "php", "fullname": "PHP", "id": 183}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Scala", "shortname": "scala", "fullname": "Scala", "id": 704}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Educational Community License", "shortname": "educom", "fullname": "Educational Community License", "id": 629}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: XML-based", "shortname": "db_api_xml", "fullname": "XML-based", "id": 507}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Quality Engineers", "shortname": "enduser_qa", "fullname": "Quality Engineers", "id": 537}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
