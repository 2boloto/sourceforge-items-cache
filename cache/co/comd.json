Multitenant database requires\r\nhigh performance, low space requirement and excellent scalability. To achieve\r\nthis parameters there are two approaches namely Independent Tables Shared Instances (ITSI) and Shared Tables Shared Instances(STSI). Since multitenant database need to maintain large number of tables the ITSI approach gives poor scalability\r\nbut STSI approach gives good scalability and poor performance with high space overhead. The adaptive database schema design is proposed for multitenant\r\ndatabase which trade off the ITSI and STSI and find balance between them to improve the good scalability and high performance with low space requirement. This schema design maintain two types of table namely base table and supplementary\r\ntable.
