For example, it can be used to back up hundreds of Linux desktops to a central server with no user interaction, and with changes appearing on the central server within minutes of the originals being changed on the desktop.\r\n\r\nThe package also includes the \"watchdir\" utility, which writes change notification files when the contents of a directory are altered.\r\n\r\nSee the project home page for more information.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "continual-sync", "_id": "548b972185540d61810cc55d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2377997, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Tool to keep duplicates of directory trees continually in sync", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving :: Backup", "shortname": "backup", "fullname": "Backup", "id": 137}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Artistic License 2.0", "shortname": "artisticv2", "fullname": "Artistic License 2.0", "id": 677}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "id": 238}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
