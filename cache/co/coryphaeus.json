Version 1 first appeared in 1996 for 16-bit Windows, and it was continuously maintained for Windows platforms through 4 major versions until 2012, when the author finally gave up the struggle of trying to keep a legacy Delphi application current in a changing world.\r\nVersion 5 is a complete cross-platform rewrite. It retains much of the user interface of earlier versions, but has been rewritten from the ground up, in a current language, and with all the underlying technology rethought.\r\nPronounce it co-RIF-ee-us.", "shortname": "coryphaeus", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Coryph\u00e6us automates the admin involved in dealing a round of Dixonary", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2469888}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/coryphaeus/", "video_url": null}
