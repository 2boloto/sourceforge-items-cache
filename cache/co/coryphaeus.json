Dixonary is an online version of the parlour game otherwise called Balderdash! or Fictionary. This game began in the Tapcis forum on CompuServe on 4 July 1989. Having just celebrated its silver jubilee, it is now, at least according to Wikipedia, the world's longest-running online game, and is still going strong.\r\nThis project is version 5 of Coryph\u00e6us. Version 1 first appeared in 1996 for 16-bit Windows, and it was continuously maintained for Windows platforms through 4 major versions until 2012, when the author finally gave up the struggle of trying to keep a legacy Delphi application current in a changing world.\r\nVersion 5 is a complete cross-platform rewrite. It retains much of the user interface of earlier versions, but has been rewritten from the ground up, in a current language, and with all the underlying technology rethought.\r\nPronounce it co-RIF-ee-us.", "summary": "Coryph\u00e6us automates the admin involved in dealing a round of Dixonary", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2469888, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "coryphaeus", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/pkeating/", "username": "pkeating", "name": "Paul Keating"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://coryphaeus.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "id": 7}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: wxWidgets", "fullname": "wxWidgets", "shortname": "ui_wxwidgets", "id": 481}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "fullname": "Python", "shortname": "python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V3.0", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License V3.0", "shortname": "ccaslv3", "id": 870}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "id": 80}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "fullname": "OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "id": 906}]}}
