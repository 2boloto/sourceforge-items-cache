Built on stable, long-running infrastructure, it utilises versatile web-based paradigms to facilitate rapid prototyping and improve iterative development processes.  Absolute portability is achieved by leveraging open web browser core frameworks and multi-platform consistency in core web-centric programming languages.  \r\n\r\nCovalent is 100% Java-free, but delivers on the failed promises of Java's initial product goals.  By layering together an open web rendering framework (WebKit or SeaMonkey), an open application engine (PHP or SquirrelFish Extreme), and core web languages (HTML, XML, ECMAScript, MathML, and more), desktop applications can be built as simply as websites.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "covalent", "_id": "53f08d5624b0d94bc46d3d11", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2306749, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "Cross-platform desktop application runtime engine", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
