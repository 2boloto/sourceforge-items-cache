Laminate theory is used with several strength criteria: maximal stress, maximal strain, Tsa\u00ef-Hill and Tas\u00ef-Wu. A help including a Getting Started part is now available in the application. The users can add their own formulas or application, an example is provided with a tank under pressure. Several load cases can be calculated in one time in the Print sheet. Laminates can be saved in the Library sheet. Several versions of Coexlam are available on Sourceforge: Coexlam v1.1 and Coexlam v1.2. The version 1.2 directly includes all the version 1.1 + additional features.
