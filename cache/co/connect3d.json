As a result, it can interpolate much more sparse sampling as state-of-the-art algorithms. Run-time is in practice linear to that of the Delaunay triangulation of the points.\r\nThe software is designed as a command-line tool. It can also be used as a library. A plug-in for the Meshlab geometry software is available as well.", "shortname": "connect3d", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Reconstruct Water-Tight Triangulation from Point Cloud", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1806678}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/connect3d/", "video_url": ""}
