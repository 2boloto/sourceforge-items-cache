As a result, it can interpolate much more sparse sampling as state-of-the-art algorithms. Run-time is in practice linear to that of the Delaunay triangulation of the points.\r\nThe software is designed as a command-line tool. It can also be used as a library. A plug-in for the Meshlab geometry software is available as well.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "connect3d", "_id": "51a460c1d46bb43a496c7fed", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1806678, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Reconstruct Water-Tight Triangulation from Point Cloud", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
