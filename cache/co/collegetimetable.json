This software works on the most basic design which can really simplify hundreds of hours of work for teachers of small school/college  or education institute. The key feature of this software is Spreadsheet design which is easy to understand for novice computer user. \r\nAnother special thing about this utility is that it  does not ask to fill up information required but on the contrary it collects the information on the fly\r\nYou can start creating time table without entering number of teachers, their names,subjects etc.\r\n\r\nNo provision for room numbers at present. But can  be added in future.\r\n\r\nThis software uses 'MFC Grid Control' by Chris Maunder. Thanks to Chris for making it available under CPOL\r\n\r\nYou may also find my other two projects interesting.\r\n\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/marklist\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/set4", "shortname": "collegetimetable", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "It is small & powerful utility to generate school/college time table.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2285105}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/collegetimetable/", "video_url": null}
