It was made because games in python end up quite ugly and bloated. This is designed to be clean & easy. It's an interpreter, It was written in C++. Not a singe line of code was written by an adult (except the standard c++ libraries). Give it a try and tell me what you think. It's a work in progress so there are only input and output functions, variables and if statements. Because it's at  an early stage in design, any ideas you give me now can be integrated into language while it's still possible. It is currently in active development. New versions are released every week. So keep on checking. Don't hesitate to mod it, just don't forget to give credit to the original author Majak Akec.   To test it,\r\ndownload the EXE from 'bin'. Run the EXE than type 'hello.cl'. Also, to get the most out of it, try out Pond IDE made by Wasif Boksh - it's epic!
