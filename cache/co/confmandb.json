Support for other Linux distributions, OS X and possibly Windows maybe available in the future. CMDB is open source (under GPL v3) and leverages many other open source systems. CMDB scripts are written mostly in PHP and BASH. CMDB integrates the following software systems:  Apache,MySQL, Subversion, Trac, Kickstart, Puppet, YUM, Squid   CMDB was previously named LINF (Linux INFrastructure Management System) from 2007, but was renamed and released as ConfManDB in 2012.", "summary": "Configuration Management Database", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 685248, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "confmandb", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/haverje/", "username": "haverje", "name": "John Haverlack"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/confmandb/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "id": 9}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Unix Shell", "fullname": "Unix Shell", "shortname": "shell", "id": 185}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: PHP", "fullname": "PHP", "shortname": "php", "id": 183}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: MySQL", "fullname": "MySQL", "shortname": "db_net_mysql", "id": 524}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "id": 253}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "fullname": "English", "shortname": "english", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "fullname": "Linux", "shortname": "linux", "id": 201}]}}
