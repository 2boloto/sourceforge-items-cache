For OS X, there are two ways of getting a compose key:\r\n\r\n1. With a dedicated keyboard layout such as the ones provided by this project.

By customizing the Cocoa text system, that is, by editing the file Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict. This has the advantage that it is easier to modify and that it will work across different keyboard layouts.
