It will help system administrators and end users keep the software packages up to date and will help make full re-installs faster and more efficient.\r\n\r\nWindows does not have a good way to keep track of the current version of software installed on a users system. That job is left up to two sources: the applications themselves can be auto-updating, or it is up to the user to constantly check for updates to their favorite software packages.\r\n\r\nIn comes Conloco. In Latin, Conloco means to set right, put, place, or set. The main purpose of this application is parse a series of python scripts to get the uri location of a software package, download the package, and install the package with as little user interaction as possible. It will also check the version numbers to see if there has been a change to the current version, notifying the user if there must be updates.\r\n", "shortname": "conloco", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Keep your software up to date and download new software with ease.
