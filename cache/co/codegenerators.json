You take a chunk of code, copy it and change a few bits to implement each feature. This is tedious enough when there is only one file involved, but updating changes in two or three files leads to errors.\r\n\r\nA code generator is a much better solution. Write the specification, press the button and out comes the code. Goedel is a code generation tool that generates code generators that has its own SourceForge project.\r\n\r\nThis project contains tools that are not used to build Goedel and are not part of the Goedel project. At present the only tool in this project is Publisher, a tool that generates a HTML page that tracks releases of project binaries.\r\n\r\nAdditional code generators currently under development generate parser/generator code for implementing REST Web Services, and DNS record sets in C#, C and Python. \r\n\r\nAnother code generator in the works produces a GUI in native Windows or OSX style.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "codegenerators", "_id": "50eee4b07929e5274831f2a8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1222371, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Easy to use tools that do the work for you", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
