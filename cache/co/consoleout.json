Well... ConsoleOut is for you!\r\n\r\nIt's a java class that periodically prints formatted data to the console giving you the average for a given key value pair, or the most common for strings.  I've found it useful for quick timing checks during development without dumping huge amounts of data to a log file or polluting your development code with System.out.prints. It works across multiple threads.\r\n\r\nIt works best in Eclipse and I've found it quite useful and I hope you do too!", "shortname": "consoleout", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Java pretty printing console logger", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1027288}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/consoleout/", "video_url": ""}
