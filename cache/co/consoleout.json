Well... ConsoleOut is for you!\r\n\r\nIt's a java class that periodically prints formatted data to the console giving you the average for a given key value pair, or the most common for strings.  I've found it useful for quick timing checks during development without dumping huge amounts of data to a log file or polluting your development code with System.out.prints. It works across multiple threads.\r\n\r\nIt works best in Eclipse and I've found it quite useful and I hope you do too!", "summary": "Java pretty printing console logger", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1027288, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "consoleout", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/snellybigoda/", "username": "snellybigoda", "name": "Peter Lever"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
