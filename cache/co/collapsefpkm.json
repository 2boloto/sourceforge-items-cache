It's like in some cases the FPKM values from the transcripts corresponding to the same gene do not get summed, although the transcripts are assigned to the same gene.\r\n\r\nReasons and Solution:\r\nThe multiple FPKM problem occurs when genes have transcripts that do not overlap with any other transcripts in the gene. For example, this occurs in the ENSG00000125388 gene from ENSEMBL/hg19. We are aware of this issue and will eventually change the behavior, but for now a simple solution is just to sum the FPKMs since the gene FPKMs are just the sum of the transcript FPKMs anyways.  \r\n\r\nThe details on  this is discussed at http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5224", "shortname": "collapsefpkm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "This code is a solution to collapsing duplicate FPKMs for a gene", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2230933}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/collapsefpkm/", "video_url": null}
