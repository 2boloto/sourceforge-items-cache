It's like in some cases the FPKM values from the transcripts corresponding to the same gene do not get summed, although the transcripts are assigned to the same gene.\r\n\r\nReasons and Solution:\r\nThe multiple FPKM problem occurs when genes have transcripts that do not overlap with any other transcripts in the gene. For example, this occurs in the ENSG00000125388 gene from ENSEMBL/hg19. We are aware of this issue and will eventually change the behavior, but for now a simple solution is just to sum the FPKMs since the gene FPKMs are just the sum of the transcript FPKMs anyways.  \r\n\r\nThe details on  this is discussed at http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5224", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "collapsefpkm", "_id": "53781d9cea406b76ee6fcde8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2230933, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "This code is a solution to collapsing duplicate FPKMs for a gene", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
