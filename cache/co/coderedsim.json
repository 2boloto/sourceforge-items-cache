Included is a design of that architecture, a Java-based simulator, an implementation (without vector instructions) designed as a Logisim circuit (http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/), and more.  \r\n\r\nThe name \"Code Red\" comes from our team name, the Red Team.  Since the competition dictated a small team size, our professor split the class and gave each group a color.  We liked the name \"Code Red\" and chose it to represent our team and school's color (UMass' official color is Maroon.) Only later did we realize that \"Code Red\" was the name of an unrelated computer worm from 2001.
