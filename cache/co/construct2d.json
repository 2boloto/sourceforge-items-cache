The grids are generated in Plot3D format.  The only required input file is the set of coordinates defining the airfoil geometry, using the same format as XFoil, the popular vortex-panel code for airfoil analysis.  Construct2D can create grids with O topology (recommended for airfoils with a blunt trailing edge) or C topology (recommended for airfoils with a sharp trailing edge).  Now available in version 2.0: hyperbolic grid generation to create higher quality grids in a fraction of the time compared to elliptic grid generation.  Elliptic grid generation is still available also.  Smooth airfoil surface spacing is handled automatically with user-controlled clustering parameters. Also included is a visualizer written in Python with matplotlib.
