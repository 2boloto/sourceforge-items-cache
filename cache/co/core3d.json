Tightly coupled or interrelated functionalities are partitioned into groups. These groups ensure there is a separation of concerns. For example, the description of shapes and visual characteristics of a scene are separated from code that renders the scene on different graphics hardware. This code structure allows any developer to build a 3D application quickly without having to know much about rendering pipelines, event handling, threading, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Core3D framework consists of a collection of very lightweight classes that model a complete 3D environment. The rendering classes interpret the modeling information directly into the underlying 3D Graphics API with minimal intermediate computations. \r\n\r\nPlease check the Blog regularly for status updates.", "summary": "Minimalist 3D Scenegraph Management Framework", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 649749, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "core3d", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/theongu/", "username": "theongu", "name": "Theodore Nguyen"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "id": 8}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: OpenGL", "fullname": "OpenGL", "shortname": "ui_opengl", "id": 475}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (UI) :: Project is a 3D engine", "fullname": "Project is a 3D engine", "shortname": "ui_meta_3d", "id": 466}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "id": 680}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics :: 3D Rendering", "fullname": "3D Rendering", "shortname": "3drendering", "id": 110}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Multimedia :: Graphics :: Presentation", "fullname": "Presentation", "shortname": "presentation", "id": 111}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "fullname": "Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
