Tightly coupled or interrelated functionalities are partitioned into groups. These groups ensure there is a separation of concerns. For example, the description of shapes and visual characteristics of a scene are separated from code that renders the scene on different graphics hardware. This code structure allows any developer to build a 3D application quickly without having to know much about rendering pipelines, event handling, threading, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Core3D framework consists of a collection of very lightweight classes that model a complete 3D environment. The rendering classes interpret the modeling information directly into the underlying 3D Graphics API with minimal intermediate computations. \r\n\r\nPlease check the Blog regularly for status updates.", "shortname": "core3d", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Minimalist 3D Scenegraph Management Framework", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 649749}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/core3d/", "video_url": ""}
