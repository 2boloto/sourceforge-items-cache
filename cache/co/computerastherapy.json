Krajicek inspired by iSEN.cz team, consequently it was continuing in coop. e.g. with Faculty of IT, Brno University of Technology (BUT FIT). Computer as therapy is human computer interaction (HCI) research and therapy in one piece. \r\n\r\nWe have pointed out that there are many uncovered usability and accessibility issues even on existing apps. Hence we have proposed the framework of iCT which defines how the HW and SW should be designed, developed and deployed, used to bring maximal outcome in therapy for mentally challenged.\r\n\r\nOn this project page we present already developed SW apps according to iCT framework. Apps were developed by students of BUT FIT under the supervision of R. Koci and J. Krajicek from BUT FIT. \r\n\r\nProject developers: \r\n- O. Vejtasa: EasyTalk app - SW for AAC communication\r\n- V.
