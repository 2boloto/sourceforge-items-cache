In its current state, the algorithm is finished. Future updates will try to:\r\n\r\n1. Add heuristics instead of just checking for wins\r\n2. Introduce alpha-beta pruning\r\n\r\nOther updates not concerning the AI will be:\r\n\r\n1. Coins will fall down into place, instead of appearing\r\n2. You can set if you want to play with 2 humans, 2 computers or an AI and a human.\r\n3.
