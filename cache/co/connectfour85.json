In its current state, the algorithm is finished. Future updates will try to:\r\n\r\n1. Add heuristics instead of just checking for wins\r\n2. Introduce alpha-beta pruning\r\n\r\nOther updates not concerning the AI will be:\r\n\r\n1. Coins will fall down into place, instead of appearing\r\n2. You can set if you want to play with 2 humans, 2 computers or an AI and a human.\r\n3. You can select different AI's\r\n\r\nLots of work left to do :-)\r\n\r\nI hope this can help somebody who is also struggling  on creating a simple AI.\r\n", "shortname": "connectfour85", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A simple connect four game in C#", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 781084}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/connectfour85/", "video_url": ""}
