In the idea of physical layer network coding, two synchronized simultaneous packet transmissions are carefully encoded such that the superimposed transmission can be decoded to produce a packet which is identical to the bitwise binary sum of the two transmitted packets. This paper explores the decoding of superimposed transmission resulted by multiple synchronized simultaneous transmissions. We devise a coding scheme that achieves the identification of individual transmission from the synchronized superimposed transmission. A mathematical proof for the existence of such a coding scheme is given.
