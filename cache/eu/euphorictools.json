As such, they required the CWSDPMI 32-bits extender in order to be run on DOS.\r\n\r\nProblem is that modern versions of Windows can't execute 16-bits applications anymore.\r\nI guess very few people have a use for DOS nowadays, so the Euphoric Tools collection will now be compiled as true 32-bits Windows Command Line applications. This way, they can be used on all 32-bits Windows versions, and also on current 64-bits Windows version (thanks to the Windows-on-Windows system)...\r\n\r\nSome of these tools are very old, maybe one day I will have to compile them as 64-bits applications. If these Tools are still useful to some people, then I will be able to say they have crossed several decades of PC platforms... ;-)\r\n\r\nPS: the quick and dirty sources are given, easy to compile on Unix...", "shortname": "euphorictools", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Companion Tools to Euphoric and other Oric emulators.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1961972}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/euphorictools/", "video_url": ""}
