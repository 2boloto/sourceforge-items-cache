As such, they required the CWSDPMI 32-bits extender in order to be run on DOS.\r\n\r\nProblem is that modern versions of Windows can't execute 16-bits applications anymore.\r\nI guess very few people have a use for DOS nowadays, so the Euphoric Tools collection will now be compiled as true 32-bits Windows Command Line applications. This way, they can be used on all 32-bits Windows versions, and also on current 64-bits Windows version (thanks to the Windows-on-Windows system)...\r\n\r\nSome of these tools are very old, maybe one day I will have to compile them as 64-bits applications. If these Tools are still useful to some people, then I will be able to say they have crossed several decades of PC platforms... ;-)\r\n\r\nPS: the quick and dirty sources are given, easy to compile on Unix...", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "euphorictools", "_id": "5242acb2c4d1047321d7cf84", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1961972, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}], "summary": "Companion Tools to Euphoric and other Oric emulators.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
