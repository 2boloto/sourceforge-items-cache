JPlex lexers are NIO-based, DFA-powered, push-driven, and fully decoupled and reusable.  Their state machines are precompiled and serialized, so run time initialization is fast no matter how large the rule set.\r\n\r\nJPlex is not a parser generator; it only generates an interface for its parsers, and it does not build a parse tree.  When the lexer identifies a token that has a named event associated with it, it passes the token to the parser method associated with that event.  A lexer can dispatch token events to any number of parsers.\r\n\r\nJPlex is steadily being improved, and the Subversion repo will almost always be newer and better than the binary download.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jplex", "_id": "4fa40fceb9363c5cbb0005a3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 763138, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Java lexical analyzer generator", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Code Generators", "shortname": "codegen", "fullname": "Code Generators", "id": 259}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
