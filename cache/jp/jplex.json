JPlex lexers are NIO-based, DFA-powered, push-driven, and fully decoupled and reusable.  Their state machines are precompiled and serialized, so run time initialization is fast no matter how large the rule set.\r\n\r\nJPlex is not a parser generator; it only generates an interface for its parsers, and it does not build a parse tree.  When the lexer identifies a token that has a named event associated with it, it passes the token to the parser method associated with that event.  A lexer can dispatch token events to any number of parsers.\r\n\r\nJPlex is steadily being improved, and the Subversion repo will almost always be newer and better than the binary download.", "shortname": "jplex", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Java lexical analyzer generator", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 763138}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jplex/", "video_url": ""}
