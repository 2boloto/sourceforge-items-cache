Scrypt makes the strong password more resistant to attackers who have more memory bandwidth than you.\r\n\r\nPBKDF2 was a good solution a decade ago, but modern GPUs and ASICs have made it relatively inexpensive to put together something with raw computing power many times more powerful than an expensive CPU.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand memory bandwidth is going in the other direction. Modern CPUs excel at memory bandwidth. Custom ASICs have two orders of magnitude less of an advantage over CPUs in memory bandwidth compared with the advantage they can have in compute power.\r\n\r\nDespite its name, Pbkdf2's unique ability isn't creating PBKDF2-derived passwords, it's making it easy to create Scrypt-derived passwords.\r\n\r\nAll available documentation can be read online at http://pbkdf2.sourceforge.net", "shortname": "pbkdf2", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Expands passwords using pbkdf2 and scrypt", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2248177}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pbkdf2/", "video_url": null}
