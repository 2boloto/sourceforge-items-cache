I wanted to remove all the complex layers of abstraction that are present in the Operating Systems of today such as Graphial Interfaces and Networking etc etc and just have a simple OS that loads programs.\r\n\r\nFeautures- Command Line Interface\r\n                  Basic Interpreter\r\n                  File Manager\r\n                  Text Editor\r\n                  Games\r\n                  and more...\r\n\r\n   Note- As of now until more testing is done the best way to boot ZachOS is from a Virtual Machine like VirtualBox or VMWare", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "zachos", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/wiired24/", "username": "wiired24", "name": "Zach McPherson"}], "external_homepage": null}
