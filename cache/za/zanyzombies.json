Now, before you delve into this game I would like to introduce its story. You control Alex 'Random' Rybak in his adventure to collect as much bacon as possible in this post-apocalyptic zombie-infested nightmare. With each time he finishes off his wave of zombies, another bigger and faster wave springs up in his place. Eventually the zombies WILL overpower you, and you will die from zombies(.......unless you collect a boatload of bacon!).I made this game mainly from a span of the 25th of May to the 27th of May, and I would like for you to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.\r\nDeveloped by Shreyas Tallamraju", "shortname": "zanyzombies", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A twin-stick zombie-wave-defense game with bacon developed by ShreyasT", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1806363}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/zanyzombies/", "video_url": ""}
