It was tested and used for FreeBSD, Solaris, and several flavors of Red Hat based Linux hosts.\r\n\r\nAs this is an auto-discovery process, it will reflect changes in \"HDD space\" when there are any changes in host H/W.\r\n\r\nWhilst this project was in quasi-production mode for a year or more, there were some goals that were not realized during its lifetime. Please review the \"README.first\" file in the main directory.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the HDD configuration requires an experienced Zabbix-2 administrator.
