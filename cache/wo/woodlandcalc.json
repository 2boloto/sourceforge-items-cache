The data was divided into sub-regions by landscape type using Natural England's Character Area classifications. The potential within each of these Character Areas was then estimated by working groups of local experts who were capable of making reasoned assessments of both the opportunities and constraints to woodland creation. Subsequently, this project was considerably extended and adopted as a national system. It is currently being used to compile the National Woodland Potential dataset for the whole of England.", "shortname": "woodlandcalc", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Woodland potential calculator GIS presentation application", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 728467}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/woodlandcalc/", "video_url": ""}
