We will provide a Common Interface (OreOS) that will allow all of this to feel like one great Operating System.\r\n\r\nOreOS itself will be a Game Engine designed Operating Environment that will be able to host the Wombat Ecosystem efficiently and seamlessly and will, in itself, be able to operate as a system itself.\r\n\r\nJoin the chat on irc ::\r\nServer :: gotbrew.org\r\nRoom :: #WombatISE\r\n/* Note the server automatically joins you to the main Lobby */", "shortname": "wombat-ise", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@arrogantpenguin", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A universal 64-bit Operating Environment for Multi-Processor Machines.", "tools": [{"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2079590}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wombat-ise/", "video_url": null}
