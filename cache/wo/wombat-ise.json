We will provide a Common Interface (OreOS) that will allow all of this to feel like one great Operating System.\r\n\r\nOreOS itself will be a Game Engine designed Operating Environment that will be able to host the Wombat Ecosystem efficiently and seamlessly and will, in itself, be able to operate as a system itself.\r\n\r\nJoin the chat on irc ::\r\nServer :: gotbrew.org\r\nRoom :: #WombatISE\r\n/* Note the server automatically joins you to the main Lobby */", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wombat-ise", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/pnguinpsychotix/", "username": "pnguinpsychotix", "name": "PenguinPsychotix"}], "external_homepage": null}
