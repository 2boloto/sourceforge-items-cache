Just like other, GUI toolkits such as Qt, GTK, MFC, Swing etc it provides a user interface for your program with buttons, checkboxes, menus etc.\r\n\r\nWhat makes WonderGUI different from other GUI toolkits is that it doesn't have a standard look and feel, instead it is made to bring your own unique user interface to life with the widgets and layouts that you design.\r\n\r\nWonderGUI is also built for easy integration into an existing code base. It doesnâ€™t run your main loop, initialize your application window or assume to be the only code drawing in your window. Instead, you tell WonderGUI about mouse and keyboard events and the screen regions where widgets might need to be redrawn.\r\n\r\nThis makes WonderGUI an excellent toolkit for games and media applications.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wondergui", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/tordj/", "username": "tordj", "name": "Tord Jansson"}], "external_homepage": "http://wondergui.com"}
