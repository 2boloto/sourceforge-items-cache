Several adventurers like yourself have set off for Firetop Mountain in search of the Warlock's hoard. None have ever returned. Do you dare follow them?\r\n\r\nYou take the role of an adventurer on a quest to find the treasure of a powerful Warlock, hidden deep within Firetop Mountain. People from a nearby village advise that the treasure is stored in a chest with two locks, and that the keys are guarded by various creatures within the dungeons. You approach the shadow of the great mountain and prepare you weapons.\r\n\r\nThe local villages have warned you that the entrance is well guarded and you expect it no other way...\r\n\r\nGood luck!", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wofm", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/corremn/", "username": "corremn", "name": "Corremn"}], "external_homepage": "https://code.google.com/p/wofm/"}
