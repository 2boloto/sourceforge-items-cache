Please enter a new word)\r\n\r\nWordzilla gives a word and you have to give the word with the last letter of the word entered ass your first letter. As Wordzilla gives \"Hello\" the player must give a word that starts with 'o' as \"Ongoing\" . As the player ends the word with g then wordzilla will give a word that starts with the letter 'g' as \"Gathering\" . The player has to give a word that starts with the letter 'g' . If he enters \"Gathering\" again then the score won't increase and the clock will keep ticking. The life also decreases by 1. You have five chances for the game. You can pause the timer 5 times and can resume. You can also exit the game and then resume the game.", "shortname": "wordzilla", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/Yennaachi", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Wordzilla - An open source word game", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2065767}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wordzilla/", "video_url": ""}
