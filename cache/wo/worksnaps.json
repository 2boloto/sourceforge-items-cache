As an employer or manager, you are facing the challenge of knowing exactly what your remote team is working on and whether you are paying for the actual hours worked. Worksnaps solves this problem by letting you visualize your employee's work, helping ensure that their time is spent on task. Worksnaps captures your employee's time with such things as random screen shots, keyboard and mouse clicks, and software applications as well as other important metrics. As a result, you can verify their time on task as well as identify any questionable time spent on things unrelated to their assigned tasks. Worksnaps improves the visibility and accountability of how time is spent and what you are really spending your money on. It is simple, automatic and effective.", "shortname": "worksnaps", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Keep Your Virtual Team Working Efficiently", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 989643}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/worksnaps/", "video_url": ""}
