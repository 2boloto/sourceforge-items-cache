Also it has its own native previous file version recovery tool which works in any version of Windows, Vista-Windows 8. Another feature is a preloaded search interface for finding temporary, deleted and lost versions of corrupt files.\r\n\r\nFuture plans are to implement Microsoft's instructions for recovering corrupt Word files that will open. \r\n\r\nThis program was formerly known as Word Recovery and more recently S2 Services Word Recovery.", "shortname": "wordrecovery", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/socrtwo", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Brings into one place MS methods for recovering files that won't open", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 963996}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wordrecovery/", "video_url": ""}
