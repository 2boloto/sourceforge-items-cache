To generate this environmentAffinity requires the user provide specific information about their life. This information covers locations inhabited, travel history, climate and temperature preferences, and psychological factors such as phobias and anxiety. From these entries an algorithm selects the correct configuration of environmental elements for that player. The primary means employed by Affinity for stimulating its users is scalar shifting. This effect puts the player in an environment of a different scale than his or her profile determines they are accustomed. Imagine yourself exploring the particles of an atom, or being exposed to the vastness of the Cosmos, and everything in between. The result is meditative and introspective.
