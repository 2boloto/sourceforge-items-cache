The prevention mechanism divides into two categories - Local and Global. In the scenario of local solution, the protection of individual nodes involves three categories - local solutions, changing IPs and creating client bottle neck. By installing the filter on the local router to detect the infiltrating IP packets is stopped using time worn short term solutions. By changing the victims IP address is one of the techniques to prevent the attacker from accessing its network, however this technique is not effective, many attacker node will easily identify the newer IP address. The major objective behind this technique is creating bottleneck process on the zombie computers, for example making simple puzzle to solve before establishing connection or a software already inst", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ddosattacksimplementationinns2", "_id": "52381ae485540d74d29c2a8f", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1955539, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "DDoS Attacks Implementation in ns2 Network Simulator with Abstract", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
