However, what slips through, on legitimate ports, can sometimes be denial of service attacks. A truly distrubuted denial of service attack is something for where there exists no known solution (at least at this time). However, a single user dos (or a small number of users working together) can effectively be thwarted if your pipe (internet connection) is large. Running on a short cycle (such as 1 minute), ddos_delfate ege can detect nefarious IP's that have bombarded a port with a tremendous number of connections (in a soho environment, 100 connections from a single IP that is not in your LAN constitutes a 'big red warning flag', but you can set this connection limit to your liking in the config file).
