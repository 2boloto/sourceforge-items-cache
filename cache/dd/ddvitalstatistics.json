I enjoyed creating family trees for my characters, but I found it very laborious to come up with all of the dates I needed, so I sat down and wrote a little program to randomly generate birth and death dates for each of the Player\u2019s Handbook races.\r\n\r\nOver the years, I added and subtracted functionality to the program so many times that the code became unreadable and it still never functioned exactly the way I wanted it to.  Eventually, the original program was lost to hard drive failure, but the idea stayed with me and I decided to make a new version with more planning and better documentation.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of work, the second version of D&D Vital Statistics is ready to be shared with the world.\r\n\r\nAll information generated is compatable with 3.0/3.5 edition D&D. Don't forget the user manual; it explains some design choices which could be seen as errors.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ddvitalstatistics", "_id": "52339c3c1be1ce04df0a7a29", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1953157, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Generate birth date, death date, etc. for fantasy races.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
