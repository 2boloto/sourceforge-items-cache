I enjoyed creating family trees for my characters, but I found it very laborious to come up with all of the dates I needed, so I sat down and wrote a little program to randomly generate birth and death dates for each of the Player\u2019s Handbook races.\r\n\r\nOver the years, I added and subtracted functionality to the program so many times that the code became unreadable and it still never functioned exactly the way I wanted it to.  Eventually, the original program was lost to hard drive failure, but the idea stayed with me and I decided to make a new version with more planning and better documentation.\r\n\r\nAfter two years of work, the second version of D&D Vital Statistics is ready to be shared with the world.\r\n\r\nAll information generated is compatable with 3.0/3.5 edition D&D. Don't forget the user manual; it explains some design choices which could be seen as errors.", "shortname": "ddvitalstatistics", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Generate birth date, death date, etc. for fantasy races.", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1953157}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ddvitalstatistics/", "video_url": ""}
