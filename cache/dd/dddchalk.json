Here is where DDDChalk annotations come into play. They are a quick means to mark important things and express the object's role in the project in terms of domain driven development. Like a chalk that tailor uses before making alterations, this annotations are a quick way to markup classes before DDD-oriented refactoring.\r\nTools can be implemented using these annotations to bring important things to front or to enforce DDD constraints.\r\n", "shortname": "dddchalk", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Set of java annotations to express domain driven design (DDD) concepts", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2354435}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dddchalk/", "video_url": null}
