Here is where DDDChalk annotations come into play. They are a quick means to mark important things and express the object's role in the project in terms of domain driven development. Like a chalk that tailor uses before making alterations, this annotations are a quick way to markup classes before DDD-oriented refactoring.\r\nTools can be implemented using these annotations to bring important things to front or to enforce DDD constraints.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dddchalk", "_id": "5452a98a0910d4487ca9b6e1", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2354435, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Set of java annotations to express domain driven design (DDD) concepts", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "shortname": "development", "fullname": "Software Development", "id": 45}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
