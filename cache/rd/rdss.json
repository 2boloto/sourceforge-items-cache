A search function was implemented to enable users to find a specific peak value. Using the asterisk character (*) as a placeholder for one or more unknown peak value(s), the software will return the best match(es). Besides the search utility by the Raman band positions, which was proven to be priceless in the interpretation of Raman spectra, the RDSS software gives the user the ability to display and inspect the Raman spectra quickly and very efficiently. Users can zoom into the Raman spectrum, shift in any direction the wavenumber and the intensity axes, and if any part of the spectral display is clicked, that region will be highlighted and the specific wavenumber returned. A photo for every sample entry stored in the database is also available.", "shortname": "rdss", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Raman spectra library with search and storage function.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 353981}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rdss/", "video_url": ""}
