Now an open-sourced distributed file system named Raid Distributed File System (RDFS) is published by researchers in National University of Defense Technology. RDFS is a POSIX-compatible cloud storage system that achieves high availability through erasure codes. RDFS can replace the HDFS file system in the Hadoop system. The novel feature is its highly-efficient data repairs for multiple simultaneous failures that recover lost data based on the topology-aware tree structured reconstruction. RDFS permits a wide classes of coding algorithms for the repairing purposes. Further, this system optimizes the coding operations through adaptively parallel threads.", "shortname": "rdfs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "RDFS: an erasure code based cloud storage system", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2260564}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/rdfs/", "video_url": null}
