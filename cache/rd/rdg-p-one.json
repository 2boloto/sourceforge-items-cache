The program alphabetizes a dictionary file and then alphabetizes the user's word. The program then tests the user's word with the alphabetized dictionary words. When a match is found, the program finds the normal dictionary word and prints it out. Users are also able to import their own 'dictionary.txt' file. Since most dictionary files just have the un-alphabetized word, this project includes a 'parser', which takes in a proper format and creates a new file with the alphabetized dictionary.
