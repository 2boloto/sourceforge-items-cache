The program aims to allow the identification of regions where the values of either the CN state or the LOH scores are the same in all the affected individuals, but none of the unaffected individuals have the same value. As well as visualising the CN state and LOH data, the program will also display Log(2) ratio, smooth signal and allele difference values that may also be obtained from the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array (details on how to export the data are here). CN state, Log(2) ratio and the smooth signal data may be derived from either the SNP or CNV probes on the SNP microarray chip, where as the LOH and allele difference values are derived solely from the SNP probes.", "shortname": "cnviewer", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "CNViewer shows CNV and LOH data in affected and unaffected individuals", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 739252}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cnviewer/", "video_url": ""}
