FLTK and all libraries, hand-coded MIME-support are contained in the executables, all under/around 1Mbyte.\r\nYou can maybe take ideas/parts from the source-code...or use only the Calendar which is a stable part of HerMail...whatever... I shared it, maybe some people will benefit a little from the source-code a in some way...\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hermail", "_id": "5496dbe5d46bb46d82aa5cff", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2382110, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Lightweight FLTK-based email-client", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications :: Email :: Email Clients (MUA)", "shortname": "mua", "fullname": "Email Clients (MUA)", "id": 31}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: FLTK", "shortname": "ui_fltk", "fullname": "FLTK", "id": 484}], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
