Well it was something I have to do, and decide it to publish it.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that all these packages are promising \"simple usage\" but guess what, they are lying ! You need hordes of Linux administrators to prepare the web servers, databases, frameworks etc ... to make them just install themselves. \r\nTo make them also do something useful this is a different story !!\r\n\r\nHealthcheck is actually a script. Change the config file to your needs and start it. Thats it.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Mario Roy\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/many-core-engine-perl/\r\nfor his his excellent MCE module where all the parallelization is depend on\r\n\r\nGeorge Mpouras", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "healthcheck", "_id": "54f9be17f1fd8d3bee8437c9", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2421246, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Monitor remote linux servers and automatic fix problems", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
