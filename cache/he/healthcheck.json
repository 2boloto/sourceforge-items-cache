Well it was something I have to do, and decide it to publish it.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that all these packages are promising \"simple usage\" but guess what, they are lying ! You need hordes of Linux administrators to prepare the web servers, databases, frameworks etc ... to make them just install themselves. \r\nTo make them also do something useful this is a different story !!\r\n\r\nHealthcheck is actually a script. Change the config file to your needs and start it. Thats it.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Mario Roy\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/many-core-engine-perl/\r\nfor his his excellent MCE module where all the parallelization is depend on\r\n\r\nGeorge Mpouras", "shortname": "healthcheck", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Monitor remote linux servers and automatic fix problems", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2421246}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/healthcheck/", "video_url": null}
