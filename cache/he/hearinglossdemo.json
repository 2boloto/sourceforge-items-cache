Sounds can virtually be placed in environments with different acoustic properties (short/middle/long reverberation time) to simulate the various problems people with sensorineural hearing loss face everyday.\r\n\r\nNote: Current version needs MATLAB to be installed on your PC. Standalone version might follow on request. \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "hearinglossdemo", "_id": "526e71fda02bb10a09382665", "tools": [{"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1992694, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Simulation of hearing loss for speech, music and environment sounds", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
