To observe objects (in general spatial points) continuous, HEIMDALL\u2019s programmable logic arrays can be used to design monitoring systems. For data analysis an interface to the least-squares program JAG3D can be provided. The serial communication with e.g. inclination sensors, meteorological stations or total stations is handled by the library RXTX. If only a proprietary communication via dynamic-link library (dll are not shared by the project) is supported by the devices, JNA is resorted.\r\nNotice, HEIMDALL is not a stand-alone monitoring application.
