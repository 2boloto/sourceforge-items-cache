Developed by Jim Bonacci, the game was developed using flash based programming. The game is actually quite simple. It is so simple that the objectives of the game can be succinctly described in a single sentence. \r\n\tPlayer\u2019s use one of ten unique playable characters in order to go through a course in the shortest time possible or to acquire all tokens whilst avoiding hazards and obstacles scattered throughout the entire level. That\u2019s it.\r\n\tWhat makes the game so interesting is the rag doll physics that it uses whenever the characters come into contact with a hazard or obstacle. Limbs are torn off and blood gushes from the player character\u2019s body.\r\n\t Online Games that is not shy to cross the line twice while making the players laugh while everything is going downhill. The game has ten playable characters, each of which will be introduced below.\r\n", "shortname": "henryleoblog", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1284799}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/henryleoblog/", "video_url": ""}
