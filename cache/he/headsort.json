By default it works like sort(1) though.\r\n\r\nIn general headsort can sort in 1/2 the time sort(1) (mergesort) does in situations involving either pipes or mult column selection; less with both.  Infact it's speed tradeoffs are about opposite that of sort(1).\r\n\r\nAlso called \"triangulation sort\".  It most rapidly begins piping first items.  This means it has new applications in distributed computing and in some cases makes dc un-necessary.\r\n\r\nVery compatible however not a \"drop in\" (do not copy over sort(1) binary).
