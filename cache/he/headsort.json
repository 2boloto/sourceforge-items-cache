Options can sort by column and do other sort tasks.  Very compatible with sort(1).\r\n\r\nheadsort  is a shell for several sort algorithms (useable by menu).  The main algorithm is the headsort algorithm.  By default it works like sort(1) though.\r\n\r\nIn general headsort can sort in 1/2 the time sort(1) (mergesort) does in situations involving either pipes or mult column selection; less with both.  Infact it's speed tradeoffs are about opposite that of sort(1).\r\n\r\nAlso called \"triangulation sort\".  It most rapidly begins piping first items.  This means it has new applications in distributed computing and in some cases makes dc un-necessary.\r\n\r\nVery compatible however not a \"drop in\" (do not copy over sort(1) binary).  Use by need.\r\n\r\nother algorthms featured if menu used:\r\n\r\nbubble, selection, insertion, shell, distributive counting, straight radix, radix exchange, quick, merge.\r\n\r\n(note of the above are by character, some by line, some support both", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "headsort", "_id": "515f04e8485acd5f43d2eb8a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1488304, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "headsort takes 1/2 time of sort(1) in situations", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}, {"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Systems Administration", "shortname": "sysadministration", "fullname": "Systems Administration", "id": 253}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "id": 97}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other License", "id": 196}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
