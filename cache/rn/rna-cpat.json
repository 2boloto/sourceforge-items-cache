However, Most previous coding potential prediction methods heavily rely on alignment, either pairwise alignment to search for protein evidence or multiple alignments to calculate phylogenetic conservation score (such as CPC , PhyloCSF and RNACode ). This is because most previously identified transcripts including protein coding RNA and short, housekeeping/regulatory RNAs such as snRNAs, snoRNA and tRNA are highly conserved. While still very useful, these approaches have several limitations:\r\n\r\n    Most lncRNAs are less conserved and tend to be lineage specific which greatly limit the discrimination power of alignment-based methods.
