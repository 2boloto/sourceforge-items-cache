Most importantly a regulatory subnetwork is extracted showing how the activated regulators interact with their target genes and between each other. In this way, given a genome-wide expression experiment, RNEA prioritizes important regulatory and functional components. It also succeeds to reconstruct meaningful subnetworks of gene regulation, offering further ways of analyzing the data based on network theory.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rnea", "_id": "54dc9ffaea406b0bb2622d84", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2409302, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Regulatory Network Enrichment Analysis", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
