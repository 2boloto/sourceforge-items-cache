No need for *any* knowledge about CUDA or AMP or even CPU multi-threading. \r\n\r\ngxLibrary is source only ( 4 files ), intended to be included in Visual Studio 2012+ projects , primarily geared for non-production projects (proofs of concepts, testing, individual problem solutions) on Visual C++  Win32 Console applications, but can be used in other environments also.\r\n\r\nIn addition to actual library files, there are Sample projects and Tutorial.pdf\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "gxlibrary", "_id": "539af624c4d10446115c5011", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2258280, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "C++ library for easy simulations on any CUDA/AMP/CPU or remote PC", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
