The product, at this point, consists of virtual joystick devices that is seen by the system as a standard joystick but its position-data is written to it by a feeder application. An existing feeder application that takes advantage of this product is SmartPropoPlus. If you are an application writer you can very easily write an application that controls a joystick (e.g. mouse-to-joystick, keyboard-to-joystick). If you are a beginner in device drivers you can take this code and enhance it to support more (or less) axes, buttons or POVs.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vjoystick", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/userid-1374741/", "username": "shaul_ei", "name": "Shaul"}], "external_homepage": "http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net"}
