OpenGL and GLSL shaders are used for real-time 2D and 3D graphics. Time stepping is done via a real to complex FFT based convolution operation. There are also two deliberately simple test implementations in FreeBasic and Matlab. A 2D version on a sphere shows that it is really not dependent on the underlying grid.\r\n", "shortname": "smoothlife", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A generalization of Conway's Game of Life", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 705681}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/smoothlife/", "video_url": ""}
