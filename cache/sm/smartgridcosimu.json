We have resolved\r\na synchronisation problem between already existing communication and power networks\r\nsimulators. This is done through a software interface between the communication and\r\npower networks simulators. We have tested our co-simulation framework with a renewable\r\nenergy integration application.\r\n\r\n* This work was partly supported by an Open Collaborative Research (OCR) project from IBM.
