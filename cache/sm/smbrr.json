Sombrero is named after the \"Mexican Hat\" shape of the wavelet masks used in image convolution and is released under the GNU LGPL library.\r\n \r\nFeatures\r\n \r\n * Significant pixel detection with k-sigma clipping. This can reduce the background noise in an image resulting in a better structure and object detection. Various K-sigma clipping levels are supported including custom user defined clipping coefficients.\r\n\r\n * A'trous Wavelet convolution and deconvolution of images. The A'trous \"with holes\" image convolution is supported with either a linear or bicubic mask.\r\n\r\n * Image transformations, i.e. add, subtract, multiply etc. Most general operators are supported. Can be used for stacking, flats, dark frames.\r\n\r\n * Detection of structures and objects within images. StructuStructures and objects are detected within images alongside properties like max pixel, brightness, position and size.", "shortname": "smbrr", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Astronomical object/structure detection from images.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2071770}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/smbrr/", "video_url": ""}
