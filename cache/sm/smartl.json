ONLY CODE FILES.\r\n\r\nIf you're having trouble tracking down a problem in your windows service, this log file generator is just what you need. Log files can grow quite large pretty quickly when you log too much information, but you need that information to track down the problem. This logfile generator solves the problem by deleting successful iterations of a loop. This allows you to have highly detailed log files, which, at the same time, remains at a manageable size. When your service eventually break, you have all the relevant information - and only the relevant information - available to pinpoint the problem. Logging can be switched on and off with a single property. Simply add the logging code to your methods as in the example method, and your bugs will have no place to hide.", "shortname": "smartl", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Smart logfile generator for background services.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1955735}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/smartl/", "video_url": ""}
