The smart spaces concept and its open source implementation - Smart-M3 - provide methods and tools for constructing such environments. \r\n\r\nThe smart room project aims at development of a set of smart services to assist in conferences, meetings, lectures, and other educational/research/business events. The project applies the advanced Smart-M3 SDK and inherits the FRUCT groundwork on SmartConference and SmartScribo systems. Smart Room uses computational, sensing, and human interface devices. Participants use available services, such as presentations, agenda, brain storms, collective decisions. Some services are common - outcome is shown to everyone in the room; some services are personal - accessed individually via mobile end-user devices. \r\n\r\nThe project is supported by grant KA179 of Karelia ENPI programme, http://kareliaenpi.eu/", "shortname": "smartroom", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Smart services for assistance to conferences, meetings, lectures", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1137982}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/smartroom/", "video_url": ""}
