Can efficiently block promotional sms from GP, Banglalink, Teletalk, Airtel, Robi any many more. It blocks incoming call with caller id less than 6 digits. You can just install and use this app. You can also add your own sms blocking rule. All your blocked sms will be saved in the database, you can see them and easily delete or restore to inbox.\r\n\r\nImportant Notes:\r\n1. If this app 'thinks' a message is spam, that doesn't mean that the message is 'obviously' spam. It just 'thinks' that the message is spam. So, make sure, you do check your 'message log' regularly.\r\n\r\n2. This is a fork project of SMS Filter by Jelle Geerts.
