I began this site using an Agile approach, using the Presswork theme, it took me a few hours to style and launch with a few posts. But now I continue to refactor the code as Presswork has become outdated and I will need a more responsive design with the latest html5 and css3 and php5 standards. I was too busy to work on the site in the last year and let the old domain (devanswers.org) expire). But now that I finally have the cycles, I will be focusing more on it's further development. As of right now, it needs a lot of work, but gives me a place to feature some simple code samples. Please check back for improvements to the source code.
