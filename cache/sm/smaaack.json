This should work for any version of the Java client, on any version of Service Manager in any organization.\r\n\r\nAll this does is run in the system tray, wake up occasionally, and click a control on the Service Manager window to send activity.\r\n\r\nIf Service Manager is not running, this utility does nothing until Service Manager is discovered.\r\n\r\nThere is no installation, no registry entries - 100% portable, no configuration .ini files. Run the program and look for the icon in the system tray. Right click and a menu pops up with About, Help and other options.\r\n\r\nNote: this is *not* intended to help circumvent corporate usage policies and impact concurrent licensed user counts.
