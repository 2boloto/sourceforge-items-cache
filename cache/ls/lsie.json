It may seem a bit overkill, but it is fun to write and it has some practical advantages. :)\r\n\r\nThe project is work in progress. Basically it is a toy, it is not optimized nor thoroughly tested, and it supports only few built-in types. I have written it just for experimenting and to try some ideas.\r\n\r\nIt runs on Windows and Linux.
