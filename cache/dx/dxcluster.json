Traditional clusters rely on servers to relay \"spots\" to stations.  Java DX Cluster relies on P2P Networking to find other stations, and then relay spots through the network of clients to others.  As a result, it is much more stable, quicker (it relies on UDP) and more robust. \r\n\r\nJava DX Cluster is currently in Alpha, developed by Derek Brown (W4DTB).  In the future it will be packaged for all systems, and will be interfaced with applications such as HRD.", "shortname": "dxcluster", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A P2P Java-Based DX Cluster for HAM Radio Operators", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 636223}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/dxcluster/", "video_url": ""}
