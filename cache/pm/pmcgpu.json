Other parallel platforms are also welcome (multicore and manycore, FPGAs, etc).\r\n\r\nThis project has been initiated by the Research Group on Natural Computing (Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, University of Seville). \r\nPMCGPU was born inside the P-Lingua project, of the same research group. \r\n\r\nPMCGPU is a GNU project, so all the applications developed within it are released under the GPLv3 license. Just contact us if you want to participate.\r\n\r\nPlease, visit the Wiki of the project for further information.", "shortname": "pmcgpu", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Parallel simulators for Membrane Computing on the GPU", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1040824}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pmcgpu/", "video_url": ""}
