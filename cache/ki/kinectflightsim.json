Kinect Flight Sim is a flight simulator created for a UMass Amherst graphics class.  Use your arms like wings, and tilt to control the airplane.  Kinect will also respond to your voice, controlling the camera angles and graphical features.  \r\n\r\nThis game was designed before the 1.0 release of Kinect for Windows, and therefore it uses the Kinect for Xbox hardware and beta SDK.  You will need a Kinect for Xbox and y-cable, along with a full installation of (free) SDKs as described in the readme.  A keyboard-only interface is also available for those without Kinect.
