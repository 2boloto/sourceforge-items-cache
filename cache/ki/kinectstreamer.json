The program is Intended to be used in robotics applications where the controller cannot use such cameras directly due to hardware/software limitations--such as lacking usb ports or appropriate drivers--or in situations where the camera is not in close proximity to the device that needs to access it. Given that the controller can accept data from over the network, another embedded controller that is able to use these kinds of cameras can be loaded with this software to send the image and depth data from the kinect over the network to the other controller.\r\nCurrently, KinectStreamer can only use the libfreenect library as its driver. Support for the OpenNI driver should be rolling out soon. As well as a C++ client to the KinectStreamer server.\r\n\r\nDesigned by Frans Elliott.", "shortname": "kinectstreamer", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Streams data from 3D cameras over a network.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 866484}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kinectstreamer/", "video_url": ""}
