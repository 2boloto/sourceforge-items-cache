It is possible to rotate, move or zoom in or out. Further there is a rudimentary speech recognition to change the rotating axes or to do some other helpful things.\r\n\r\nKinectCAD has been written in Visual C# 2010. The package includes the source code and binaries files. To start KinectCAD it is necessary to have a correct installed Microsoft Kinect. Also it is helpful if there is an installed Kinect SDK V1. But you can also download the Runtime at: http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/E/2/EE2D29A1-2D5C-463C-B7F1-40E4170F5E2C/KinectRuntime-v1.0-Setup.exe\r\n\r\nImportant! The program is still in development! In future there will be several updates.\r\n\r\nUntil now there is a handbook and several other documents to understand KinectCAD which are not translated to english but in the near future I will translate them.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ZYCyCt75g\r\nIf there are questions or problems mail me.", "shortname": "kinectcad", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Gesture based movement with CATIA", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 685664}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kinectcad/", "video_url": ""}
