I always wanted to have an instrument that you can play with your whole body. The idea was to create a digital apparatus that can be influenced by the movements of 2 or more persons, interacting with each other through musical 'sentences'.The kinect is the ideal system to realize such an idea. It is programmed in C# using the Microsoft Kinect SDK. The system consists of two parts, one that translates the positions of the hands into musical values and one that sends out midi signals separated by different channels (midi channels 1 - 4, in this case). The signals were routed by an internal midi-router like LoopBe and sent to any softsynth. If you put your arm against the side of your body, the music stops. The more you lift your arm, the higher the tone. If you leave your arm in that position, the tone stays on.", "shortname": "kinecttheremin", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Theremin for 2 persons using kinect", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1184592}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/kinecttheremin/", "video_url": ""}
