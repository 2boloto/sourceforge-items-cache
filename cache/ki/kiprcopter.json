Parrot sells the drone as a toy controlled via a wireless device such as Ipods, Ipads, or Android based devices. Parrot advertises the toy as an advance in gaming because the control devices will project a virtual reality allowing users to play with their physical drone with an enhanced version on their controller where bullets or hot air balloons must be avoided in the virtual world. \r\n\tKIPR, KISS Institute for Practical Robotics is an organization that facilitates the learning of robotics programming in middle and high school students to peak an interest in computer science. To do this they hold competitions around the world called botball where  students program autonomous land robots to perform various sets of tasks. \r\n\tKIPR, now wants to expand and leave the ground by integrating flying robots (the AR Drone) into the tasks for added interest, fun, and challenge for students.
