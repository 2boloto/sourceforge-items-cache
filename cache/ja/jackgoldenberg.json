In that election, he was the only statewide candidate in the nation to run unopposed in both the primary and general elections. He credits that enviable position, and the 1.3 million votes he received, to the fine work of the entire staff at the Maryland Office of the Attorney General. Prior to becoming Maryland's Attorney General, Jack Goldenberg served for eight years as the chief prosecutor in the largest jurisdiction in Maryland. Under his leadership, the Montgomery County State's Attorney's office was the first in the country to fully implement community-based prosecution, becoming a nationwide model for effective crime-fighting programs.
