SDN allows logical separation between forwarding and control planes, thereby providing built-in flexibility in developing and evolving network applications. Openflow is an instantiation of Software Defined Networking. It is a programmable network protocol that allows a controller to access and configure the forwarding plane of a switch or router. OpenFlow is now being used in commercial SDN deployments. JAM is a multi-threaded, scalable, performance focused, embedded OpenFlow v 1.0 complaint controller developed in system independent C language. It supports cross-platform compilation for embedded network processing platforms e.g. Cavium Networks Octeon processor. Abstractions are considered a critical part of an OpenFlow controller that must be provided to users to abstract away the low level details of underlying network.
