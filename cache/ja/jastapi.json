The main interest in this project is to implement the behavior of the set.An API is a source code-based specif\fcation which is used as an interface by software components to communicate with each other.The API will include specif\fcations for functions, data structures, object classes and variables. Since the API being developed is language dependent(only available by using the syntax and elements of a particular language).The API specification form will be that of the Java libraries.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jastapi", "_id": "50720a5fb9363c40f02f243f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1002413, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Design and implementation of a Java API for Naive Set Theory(NST).", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
