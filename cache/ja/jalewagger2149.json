I am sure you have tried all the free sites where you have to click on others sites to get clicks to yours, I tried them long ago, I stayed on a site approximately 5 seconds, just long enough for me to get the credit for it and don't you think that is what the rest of the people on there are doing also?\r\nThen there are the sites that sell traffic, come on now how much of that do you think is legit? My guess is none of it. I have heard of no one getting a sale or a customer through that channel.\r\nWhat about You Tube? This is a great traffic generator. The best part is, its free as long as you have a web cam and if you don't you can pick one up for under $20 at an electronic store. Make videos on the same subject of the site you are generating traffic for. Example, I have a design site for business cards, flyers, etc... my videos are on this subject.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jalewagger2149", "_id": "516b948604161f3136b069de", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1554948, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
