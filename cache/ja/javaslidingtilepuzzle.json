It then shuffles the cells, requiring the user to shift rows and columns to re-create the original image. For simplicity, the supplied image must be evenly divisible by the number of rows and columns that the user wishes to split the image in to. For example, a 300x300 pixel image could be made into a 3x3, 5x5, and 3x5, puzzle, but not a 7x7 puzzle.\r\n\r\nTwo sample images (one for an easy puzzle, one for a more difficult puzzle) are provided in the \"res/\" folder. An executable .jar is provided for running the application. It must be run in the same directory as the \"res/\" folder so that it can find the arrow button images.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "javaslidingtilepuzzle", "_id": "5320bed81be1ce4dc73c04aa", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2141340, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Java Sliding Tile Puzzle", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
