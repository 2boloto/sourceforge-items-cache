We frequently use middlewares for that problem, but they are often complex and less productive. This way, at DECOM-UFOP, we have a middleware, named JavaCa&La, to build portable and scalable solutions over many high performance computer architectures. Our middleware APIs is simple, intuitive and designed for young and senior programmers who don\u2019t have high performance programming skills, i.e., knowledge in themes like Threads, Redundancies, Sockets, Datagrams, Load Balancers, Send-Receive Messages, among others. Using our middleware, different programmers can develop applications in a collaborative way, i.e., one programmer application can read and write global variables from another application, developed by another programmer, in another machine, without explicit references. Public modules or functions can also be collaboratively executed by Java Ca&La middleware.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "javacala", "_id": "51ac6b8981b24b6161637951", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1840053, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "A java middleware for multicore and multicomputer computing.
