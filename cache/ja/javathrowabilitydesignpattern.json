with unexpected errors, and exceptions, in a generic app (written in Java, for this project!).\r\n3.\tIt can to be done in any programming language that support it.\r\n4.\tIt serves for classes and interfaces, in Java.\r\n5.\tIt works with Java 6, Java 7, and Java 8, at least.\r\n\r\nRead more, from README file, in the files section of this project.\r\n\r\nPlease consider donating to my paypal
