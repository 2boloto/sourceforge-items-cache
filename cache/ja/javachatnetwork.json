The server accepts multiple chat clients and echoes text messages received from individual clients to the rest of the clients. Executable .jar files for the Chat Server and Chat Client are provided.\r\n\r\nNote: the Socket Network library allows a single server and client to run on the same machine, but two clients may not run on the same machine (due to how the ports are handled). Multiple clients running on different machines (on the same network) can connect to a single server (also on that network). Running a server and client on a machine with a 2nd client run from inside Oracle's Virtual Box on that same machine also works.\r\n\r\nTo determine what IP address to use to connect to the server, run ShowIP.jar on the machine that will run the server.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "javachatnetwork", "_id": "5323674685540d6aef5fbd41", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2146826, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Java Chat Server and Client", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
