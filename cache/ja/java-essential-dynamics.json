The trajectories may be derived from MD, FIRST/FRODA, or any other dynamic simulations that output a trajectory as a set of PDB files. The program can handle single chain PDB files with no chain identifier as well as multi chain PDB files that use chain IDs. The user may specify the set of residues to be considered for the analysis, and this set need not be contiguous. A variety of utility tools are provided that use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that are not found in MD-simulation packages or other stand alone PCA software, especially in regards to comparative analysis of multiple trajectories using subspace analysis. JED is capable of running on any platform with a suitable Java Runtime Environment (JRE).", "shortname": "java-essential-dynamics", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A complete essential dynamics package with subspace analysis.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2064326}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/java-essential-dynamics/", "video_url": ""}
