How can we monitor streets, cities, provinces of a country? How can we predict and prevent problems coming from earthquakes, snowstorms, fire spreads and all kinds of natural disasters? How can we test some new drugs without using animals? These and many other problems are initially solved by using simulators. It is extremely expensive, and sometimes dangerous, to test initial ideas in a real environment. We must use simulators to achieve comfortable confidence levels before real tests. This way, we develop simulation models where entities, named sensors, collect environment data, process data, communicate, move around the space and a lot more. JSensor is a sensor network simulator implemented at Computer Science Department of Federal University of Ouro Preto (DECOM-UFOP), Brazil. In contrast to JSensor counterparts, it is designed to simulate millions of sensors in multicore and, in near future, multicomputer architectures.", "shortname": "javajsensor", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "high performance computing, Wireless Sensors Networks Simulators", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1478373}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/javajsensor/", "video_url": null}
