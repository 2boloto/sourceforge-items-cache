Everything is written in Java and is independent from the rdbms used (first tested system is mysql, tweaking might be needed for others). The chemistry is handled using Chemistry Development Kit, this is proven code. The system holds atoms and bonds as entities in the rdbms, this makes it possible to have properties recorded using foreign keys and referential integrity. Apache Torque is used for database access. The build system of the project makes it possible to add properties directly to the molecule/atom/bond tables. This makes it more flexible than systems where structures are saved as monolithic blobs in a single table.
