Instantiate DistributedExecutorService\r\n2. Add nodes\r\n3. Submit tasks\r\n\r\nThe only requirement is that all machines have SSH and a compatible JRE (>= 6). More precisely, when a node is added, the application's jar is automatically copied (scp) to the node and a new server started (ssh).\r\nHandling of access restrictions is left to the user (ie you can type your password every time or use authentication keys).\r\n\r\nNodes can be added dynamically. When a node is added, workers are created according to the node's processor count. Eg, a cluster of 4 quadcores will give 16 workers.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "jades", "_id": "50dc2e6524b0d934e8437a0f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1199959, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Java distributed executor service library", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
