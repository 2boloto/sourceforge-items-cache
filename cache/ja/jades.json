Instantiate DistributedExecutorService\r\n2. Add nodes\r\n3. Submit tasks\r\n\r\nThe only requirement is that all machines have SSH and a compatible JRE (>= 6). More precisely, when a node is added, the application's jar is automatically copied (scp) to the node and a new server started (ssh).\r\nHandling of access restrictions is left to the user (ie you can type your password every time or use authentication keys).\r\n\r\nNodes can be added dynamically. When a node is added, workers are created according to the node's processor count. Eg, a cluster of 4 quadcores will give 16 workers.\r\n", "shortname": "jades", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Java distributed executor service library", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1199959}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/jades/", "video_url": ""}
