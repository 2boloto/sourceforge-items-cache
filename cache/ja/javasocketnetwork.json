Users can create \"server\" and \"client\" applications which interact with each other from different machines (on the same network). Each server can support multiple clients at the same time. To create a server or client, simply extend AbstractServer (or AbstractClient) and override 4 simple methods.\r\n\r\nThe library handles message sending/receiving, client connection/disconnection, and the multi-threading associated with maintaining multiple connections at once. The 4 overridable methods within AbstractServer and AbstractClient are all called from the same thread respectively, eliminating the need to worry about most threading issues.\r\n\r\nA variety of message sending methods are provided, however the \"criticalSend\" versions will suffice for most cases.\r\n\r\nSee my \"Chat Network\" project for a sample implementation of this library.", "shortname": "javasocketnetwork", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Java Socket Network Library", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2146793}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/javasocketnetwork/", "video_url": null}
