Java, being an easy language to learn and program, is well known among a lot of people. By implementing this project in Java, it allows programmers from all over the world to implement their own IRC bots without much effort and quickly. \r\n\r\nAlthough not as quick as other services, these bots are fully customizable due to their open source nature. Multithreading support may come, but there is no promise that it will arrive.\r\n\r\nJavaBot is still in a primitive mode and there are not as many features as other bots. We are currently trying to find Java developers to help us out. If you want to help us out, send any admins a message.\r\n\r\nThis project is managed without any funding, and is created solely for the purpose of helping others. If you like this bot, please spread it around the web and link others to this page. Thank you.\r\n\r\nOur github repository is at https://github.com/wei2912/JavaBot-IRC", "shortname": "javabotirc", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "JavaBot allows people to easily implement their own IRC bots.", "tools": [{"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 793405}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/javabotirc/", "video_url": ""}
