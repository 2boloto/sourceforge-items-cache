Currently supports PostgreSQL and H2 as the RDBMS backends.\r\n\r\nJaspa brings around 200 spatial functions to relational database systems that support a full set of java store procedures. The first version of Jaspa was released in July 2010.\r\n\r\nJaspa has a similar functionality as PostGIS 1.5, supporting spatial operators and predicates, arrays of geometries, spatial aggregates, etc. Jaspa is written in java and is easy to extend using java stored procedures.
