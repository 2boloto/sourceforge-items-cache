Most existing complex number packages implement only immutable complex numbers, which is easy to understand given that immutable objects lead to more understandable code. Mutable complex numbers would avoid garbage-collection penalty and therefore be faster in calculations. Javafastcomplex implements both mutable and immutable complex numbers, and has a common interface for both, allowing users to write functions that can take either a mutable or an immutable complex number as an argument. Mutable complex numbers can then be used in the most performance-critical parts of the code with immutable complex numbers being used elsewhere. Performance improvement of mutable complex numbers is 10x in the best-case scenario and about 2x in real life complex number code. The package is released under the liberal MIT license.", "shortname": "javafastcomplex", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Javafastcomplex has both mutable and immutable complex numbers", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1954439}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/javafastcomplex/", "video_url": ""}
