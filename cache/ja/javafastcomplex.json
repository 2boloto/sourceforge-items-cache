Most existing complex number packages implement only immutable complex numbers, which is easy to understand given that immutable objects lead to more understandable code. Mutable complex numbers would avoid garbage-collection penalty and therefore be faster in calculations. Javafastcomplex implements both mutable and immutable complex numbers, and has a common interface for both, allowing users to write functions that can take either a mutable or an immutable complex number as an argument. Mutable complex numbers can then be used in the most performance-critical parts of the code with immutable complex numbers being used elsewhere. Performance improvement of mutable complex numbers is 10x in the best-case scenario and about 2x in real life complex number code. The package is released under the liberal MIT license.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "javafastcomplex", "_id": "523683c63e5e83136264dae2", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1954439, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Javafastcomplex has both mutable and immutable complex numbers", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics", "shortname": "mathematics", "fullname": "Mathematics", "id": 98}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "fullname": "MIT License", "id": 188}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
