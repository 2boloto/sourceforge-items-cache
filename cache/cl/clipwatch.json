The app loads when you login but is minimized to the task tray.  Text that you copy or cut from other applications is automatically added to the clip list in the ClipWatch window.  When you want to paste something that you previously copied but is no longer in the Windows clipboard, use the hotkey to display ClipWatch and then click on the text item in the clip list (or use up/down arrow keys followed by enter) to put that text back into the Windows clipboard.  ClipWatch will then hide itself and paste the restored text into the window that was active before the ClipWatch window was displayed.", "summary": "Win32 clipboard extender/history/utility", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2296912, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "clipwatch", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/userid-1891404/", "username": "sean_e", "name": "Sean Echevarria"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://clipwatch.sourceforge.net", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "id": 12}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "id": 230}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Text Editors :: Text Processing", "fullname": "Text Processing", "shortname": "textprocessing", "id": 285}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "id": 906}]}}
