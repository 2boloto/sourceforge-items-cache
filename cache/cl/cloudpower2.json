References to Web resources, whether they be static or dynamic can be arranged into sets.  These sets can themselves contain other sets, allowing for resources to be arranged like files on an operating system.  These sets can be saved and retrieved, allowing users to organise their cloud resources.  Two graph visualisations (hierarchy and energy) let users quickly navigate the structure of references between resource sets.  The energy visualisation is particularly good at showing this structure in a compact manner when the links represent information arranged as an arbitrarily directed graph rather than a tree.  CloudPower also demonstrates how remote desktop applications can be displayed locally using X Windows, for any operating system and network configuration.\r\n\r\nA Java 5.0 (or greater) JRE is required to run the application.", "shortname": "cloudpower2", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A tool for organising, visualising and executing Web resources.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 761210}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cloudpower2/", "video_url": ""}
