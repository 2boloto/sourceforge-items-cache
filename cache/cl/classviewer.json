Can open with your preferred text editor. And can open to the method if your text editor supports a line number as an argument, which gedit does so highly recommend it. \r\n\r\nThat's a fun feature.\r\n\r\nConfigured by an XML file. Is a stateless app.\r\n\r\nDownload includes: ClassViewer.jar and ClassViewerConfig.xml\r\n \r\nCan be run from the jar. Run unpacked from the jar from the command line, for classpath and local file access.
