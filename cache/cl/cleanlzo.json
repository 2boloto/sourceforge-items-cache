The main problem with LZO is that it is absolutely not human readable. \r\n\r\nPeople have done crazy stuff to get LZO to run in their language. Usually it implies inline assembly or trying to execute data which actually contains machine code. This is sick. Whoever is responsible for this sorry situation ought to be ashamed.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to deobfuscate LZO and provide a ISC implementation of this algorithm in Python and C. In addition, I will provide a textual description of the algorithm so that it can be easily ported to any programming language.\r\n\r\nI expect a severe performance degradation, but I leave optimizing for speed to other people.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "cleanlzo", "_id": "50f2f90b1be1ce4c2ef38a3c", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1228706, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "A human-readable ISC-Licensed implementation of the LZO1X algorithm.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Algorithms", "shortname": "algorithms", "fullname": "Algorithms", "id": 620}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving :: Compression", "shortname": "compression", "fullname": "Compression", "id": 42}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
