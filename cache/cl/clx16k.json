A version which encrypts data with a 32,768-bit version of the same cypher will be released later on. This project is based off of openssl. THe algorhithm used is a modified WPA/WPA2 algorhithm, with adaptations from the project for wireless networking still in place. However, the current bitsize makes it unusable for wireless network cryptography.\r\nThe utilization of this project is restricted to private citizens and companies, and it is not authorized for government use.
