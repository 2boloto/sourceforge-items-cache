When combined with the Super Mario World (SMW) engine you can create awesome 2D platform games like Super Mario World. This language evolved from a \"clone\" of TI-BASIC which I began developing when I was having memory (segmentation fault) bugs with C. C-Lesh lacks memory allocation and destruction. There is no need to use pointers and you can never get memory leaks or program crashes caused by memory leaks. As C-Lesh is somewhat primitive you may like it if you are into C. I'd say its a step up from C for 2D games. Everything is set - all you need is a sprite sheet and some programming knowledge.\r\n", "summary": "C-Lesh is a game programming language for 2D games.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1286873, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "clshsmwengine", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/francois-cdev/", "username": "francois-cdev", "name": "Francois C-Dev"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/clshsmwengine/screenshot/worm_wars_1.png", "caption": "The title screen of Worm Wars, a game running in C-Lesh.", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/clshsmwengine/screenshot/worm_wars_1.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/clshsmwengine/screenshot/worm_wars_2.png", "caption": "Screenshot of Worm Wars - C-Lesh interpreter in action!", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/clshsmwengine/screenshot/worm_wars_2.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "C-Lesh and the SMW Engine", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "fullname": "Web-based", "shortname": "web", "id": 237}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Perl", "fullname": "Perl", "shortname": "perl", "id": 176}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "id": 197}, {"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "id": 868}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Compilers", "fullname": "Compilers", "shortname": "compilers", "id": 48}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Cross Compilers", "fullname": "Cross Compilers", "shortname": "cross_compilers", "id": 593}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Game development framework", "fullname": "Game development framework", "shortname": "gameframeworks", "id": 794}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Handheld/Embedded Operating Systems :: Android", "fullname": "Android", "shortname": "android", "id": 728}]}}
