When combined with the Super Mario World (SMW) engine you can create awesome 2D platform games like Super Mario World. This language evolved from a \"clone\" of TI-BASIC which I began developing when I was having memory (segmentation fault) bugs with C. C-Lesh lacks memory allocation and destruction. There is no need to use pointers and you can never get memory leaks or program crashes caused by memory leaks. As C-Lesh is somewhat primitive you may like it if you are into C. I'd say its a step up from C for 2D games. Everything is set - all you need is a sprite sheet and some programming knowledge.\r\n", "shortname": "clshsmwengine", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "C-Lesh is a game programming language for 2D games.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1286873}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/clshsmwengine/", "video_url": ""}
