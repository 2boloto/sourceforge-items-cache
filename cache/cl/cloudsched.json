There is still lack of tools that enable developers to compare different resource scheduling algorithms in IaaS regarding both computing servers and user workloads. To fill this gap in tools for evaluation and modeling of Cloud environments and applica- tions, we propose CloudSched. CloudSched can help developers identify and explore appropriate solutions considering different resource scheduling algorithms. Unlike traditional scheduling algorithms considering only one factor such as CPU, which can cause hotspots or bottlenecks in many cases, CloudSched treats multi-dimensional resource such as CPU, memoryt", "shortname": "cloudsched", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2075344}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cloudsched/", "video_url": ""}
