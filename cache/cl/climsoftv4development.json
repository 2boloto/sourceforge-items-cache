Climsoft is a CDMS evaluated and recognised by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). \r\n\r\nInitially the development of Climsoft involved voluntary developers from National Meteorological Services of Guinea, Kenya and Zimbabwe with sponsorship from the UK Met Office under the auspices of WMO. The development of Climsoft came out of a WMO workshop held at the African Centre of Meteorological Applications for Development (ACMAD) in Niger in 1999. The CDMS is widely used in developing countries particularly in Africa, Caribbean and South East Asia. The current version of Climsoft is version 3.2.\r\n\r\nFollowing recommendations from WMO Expert Team on CDMS for development of open-source CDMS, a decision was reached in mid 2014 to turn the development of Climsoft into an open-source project that will involve an increased number of developers from the meteorological community.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "climsoftv4development", "_id": "549a7c611be1ce228385c816", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2383471, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Climsoft version 4 Collaborative Development", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
