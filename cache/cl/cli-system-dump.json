And the best part is, as it goes along, the SDU creates a range of files to record its findings for later viewing and use.\r\n\r\nWhy choose the CLI SDU?\r\n\r\nThe CLI SDU puts all the information you need right at your fingertips - all you have to do is open up a Command Prompt window, type \"dump,\" and it starts! Because the CLI SDU relies entirely on batch scripts, it's much faster than other dump utilities, and its system of creating a file for everything it finds makes finding what you need to know a breeze - no more slogging through a massive dump file just to view your computer's directory tree(s).
