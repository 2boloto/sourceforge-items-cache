It is designed to integrate with other OpenCL code, including synchronization using OpenCL events.\r\n\r\nCurrently only two operations are supported: radix sorting and exclusive scan. Radix sort supports all the unsigned integral types as keys, and all the built-in scalar and vector types suitable for storage in buffers as values. Scan supports all the integral types. It also supports vector types, which allows for limited multi-scan capabilities.", "summary": "C++ library for sorting and searching in OpenCL applications", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 682066, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "clogs", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bmerry/", "username": "bmerry", "name": "Bruce Merry"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/p/clogs/wiki/", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "fullname": "MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "id": 188}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Algorithms", "fullname": "Algorithms", "shortname": "algorithms", "id": 620}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "id": 770}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}]}}
