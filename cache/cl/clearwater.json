IMS (the IP Multimedia Subsystem) is the standards-based architecture that has been adopted by most large telcos as the basis of their IP-based voice, video and messaging services, replacing legacy circuit-switched systems and previous generation VoIP systems based on softswitching.  Clearwater follows IMS architectural principles and supports all of the key standardized interfaces expected of an IMS core network.  But unlike traditional implementations of IMS, Clearwater was designed from the ground up for the Cloud.  By incorporating design patterns and open source software components that have been proven in many global Web applications, Clearwater achieves an unprecedented combination of massive scalability and exceptional cost-effectiveness. Project Clearwater is sponsored by Metaswitch Networks.", "summary": "IMS in the Cloud", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 59384, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "clearwater", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/martinrtaylor/", "username": "martinrtaylor", "name": "Martin Taylor"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://projectclearwater.org", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "topic": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
