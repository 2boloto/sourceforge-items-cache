Do your members pay in cash or by marking on a chart? This app aims to allow club members to perform the task of registering purchases on their smartphones via a jQuery Mobile web app, making purchasing items faster and easier for members and the treasurer alike.\r\n\r\nThe app does not handle the actual payment/billing process - this part left to the individual developer to handle. Rather, it takes as input a \"members\" table and a \"products\" table, and each purchase produces a row on a \"purchases\" table. Data can then be drawn from this table for the purpose of billing members.\r\n\r\nLive demo (the back-end is a stub; credentials aren't verified and purchases aren't actually saved): http://www.dsvu-online.dk/anderswebservice/kioskdemo\r\n\r\nSee the wiki for documentation.
