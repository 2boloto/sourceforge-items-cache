It allows you to edit and compile your LaTeX presentations online, without having to install anything. CloudBeamer adds the flexibility of seeing your slides compiled as you type without having to compile the entire presentation first, along with the option of exporting the presentation as an HTML5 page which shows the slides as if they where on the faces of a cube. Actually this feature, which appears in the editor too, is only supported by Google Chrome browser. This development project is intended to design new features for CloudBeamer and has so far reached the goal of adding Cloud Storage for presentations and images contained within them. This feature is designed in a modular way, which will allow in the near future to support other Cloud storage platforms than the one which is actually avaliable (Dropbox).", "shortname": "cloudbeamerdp", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A LaTeX editor to create Beamer presentations on the Cloud", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 677270}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/cloudbeamerdp/", "video_url": ""}
