The codes put here were used in some form as a part of my ph.d thesis.\r\n\r\nThe key ingradiant is the Monte Carlo annealing of the classical systems (like Ising model), adopted to the above type of systems, where one anneals the classical degrees of freedom, with the update cost calculated by the fermion energies.\r\n\r\nFor calculating fermion energy, one needs to know the electron density, and other parameters of the model. However, in practice one can unify a large class of models, which have broadly three components:\r\n\r\na) The tight binding hamiltonian (depends on lattice geometry)\r\nb) The part the couples fermions to classical degrees of freedom\r\nc) The classical part of the Hamiltonian\r\nThus, to get the energy one needs to diagonalize the (a)+(b) to get the eigenvalues which are used to total energy.
