If you extend your desktop, you can see your notes but you won't be able to see the screen you're demoing.\r\n\r\nPrograms like PowerPoint solve this problem by giving you a presenter view. Where the secondary screen shows your slideshow and your primary screen showing a preview of that and your notes. But what if you're presenting an application or a website? Or even if you have your presentation in online presentation sites like Prezi?\r\n\r\nSide Mirror solves that by allowing you to extend your desktop, while having whatever you want open on your primary screen.
