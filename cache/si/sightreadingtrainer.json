To use it you should use Firefox with Java Applet Plug-in installed. Developed using Firefox 25.0.1 and Java 7, Update 51. So what is it? Well it scrolls random notes within a selected key, playing them aloud for audio confirmation, while you, the user, play the notes on your instrument.\r\n\r\nThere is no MIDI interface, the name refers to MIDI because it uses the Java Midi API and organizes everything numerically, according to MIDI numbers. The application plays the notes aloud as they pass under the centerline of the application window. So you adjust the scrolling speed and time between new notes and then play each note before the application echos it back to you. It also scrolls guitar tablature, as can be seen in the video.  \r\n\r\nThe keyboard and guitar models are linked so that playing a note on the piano keyboard (clicking a key) causes the guitar neck to display all the locations of the same note on the guitar neck.
