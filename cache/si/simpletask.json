It is a reminder app with the name \"Simple Task\".\r\n\r\nMany existing task apps in the app store often have one negative aspect that the user waste a lot of time to set a new task. They have to choose the date, the time of the reminder etc.. That's why I made the decision to create my own app. I simply want to add tasks with an alert in 10 or 30 minutes or in 1 or 2 hours. Only type in your task and press the button with the minutes you want to wait to get your notification.\r\nAfter waiting for example 10 minutes you will get a notification with the task.\r\nWhen the notification appears you can either press the close button to close the notification or press the \u201ewait 10 minutes\u201c button to get another alert in 10 minutes.", "shortname": "simpletask", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Mac App to plan your tasks", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2314631}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/simpletask/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/a5TpBFxL_do?rel=0"}
