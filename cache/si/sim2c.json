Commercially available tools for code generation are Embedded Coder from Mathworks and TargetLink from dSpace. Flex and Bison are used in this project for code generation. Flex and bison are widely used code-generation tools and are free.\r\nModel parser generated from Flex and Bison has the capability to parse model file and extract all the information related to blocks and lines in the model. Block information extracted by parser is used in creating tree of blocks records which represent block hierarchy and their interrelation in model. Tree generated by parser can be used for performing Static Analysis of Model, Automatic Test Case Generation or Code Generation. Technique used in this project for code generation from Simulink model has few limitations too.\r\nFor more information please refer document \"C-code Generation from Simulink Models using Flex and Bison.pdf\".", "shortname": "sim2c", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "C-code Generation from Simulink Models using Flex and Bison", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 771522}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sim2c/", "video_url": ""}
