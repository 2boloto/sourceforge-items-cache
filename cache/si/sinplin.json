The class is divided in two groups having the same number of students. There is a 10X10 board, each cell numbered from 1 to 100. Behind each number there are the numbers between -50 and +50 (0 excluded) in random positions. The first student of the first group selects (clicks) three cells. Then she adds the three numbers in pairs of two and selects the maximum absolute value of the three sums and this is the score for that group for the time being. The first student of the second group executes the same procedure and produces the score for the second group. The second student of the first group selects two numbers and adds the current score of her group with these two numbers in all the three possible combinations. The maximum absolute value is the new score. The game proceeds that way until all the students have play. Maximum score wins.", "shortname": "sinplin", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "School game", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2426244}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sinplin/", "video_url": null}
