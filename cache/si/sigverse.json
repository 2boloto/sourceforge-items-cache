Since the mechanisms of such real-life intelligent systems are so complex, such as the physical interactions between agents and their environment and the social interactions between agents, comprehension and knowledge in many peripheral fields such as cognitive science, developmental psychology, brain science, evolutionary biology, and robotics. \r\nTherefore, we have been developing a simulator environment called SIGVerse, which is a simulator that combines dynamics, perception, and communication simulations for synthetic approaches to research into the genesis of social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce SIGVerse, its example application and perspectives.", "shortname": "sigverse", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "SIGVerse", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/SIGVerse", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simulator for Human-Robot Interaction, used in the RoboCup@Home", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2206717}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sigverse/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/Ajc9Yvo3-h8?rel=0"}
