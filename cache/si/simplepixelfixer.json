Drag it into place and then the only other configuration is an X,Y size input that is accessed by right clicking on the active area. You can even size it down to a single pixel (if you have the patience to interact with it). While running it flashes through RGB to hopefully loosen those dastardly stuck pixels.\r\n\r\nOpen an instance and size it to your trouble-spot. Set it and let it run for a couple hours while you continue to work around it. If you have multiple trouble-spots with considerable space between them simply open another instance of the exe and let it run as well. All instances will run independently and stay on top constantly so your computer can continue to function while the program does it's thing.", "shortname": "simplepixelfixer", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Free adjustable stuck pixel fixer with easy config and minimal UI", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2289249}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/simplepixelfixer/", "video_url": null}
