The created object is walkable around, saveable, loadable back. The background color and object mono-color both are changeable. This application does not make surface on the object but makes a net by points. It is able to make a turning-object with a line along an axle in 2 dimension. When the line finished it turn that around of the axle and on this way it is making the 3D object.
