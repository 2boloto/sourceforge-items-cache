Existing SIP solutions for the browser are forced to use the WebSockets API to send/receive SIP messages. But for many service providers, the WebSocket protocol could not be a feasible solution due to scalability, support and other business constraints.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the stack can be used as a full client-side C++ Stack (full-featured) without Javascript integration.", "shortname": "sippet", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "C++ SIP stack based on Chrome source code", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2315715}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/sippet/", "video_url": null}
