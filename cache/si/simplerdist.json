Also can be a far easier way to do incremental or nightly backups.  Also an easy way to have multiple hosts interact.\r\n\r\nREADME is visible on file download page\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE: $rcssrdist file\r\n\r\n(file was broadcased to default hosts list that are up.  if a rcs pair existed it was taken care of.  existence of directory on other hosts was checked (common mistakes checked)", "shortname": "simplerdist", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "simple rdist rcs and tools , srtools , synchronizing", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1848288}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/simplerdist/", "video_url": ""}
