Several coral species, with either massive or branching colony\r\ngrowth morphologies are implemented as individual colonies, which compete for space with each\r\nother as well as with macroalgae and algal turf.\r\nCoral species can be parametrised with respect to different life history characteristics, such as\r\ngrowth, reproduction, competitive abilities and susceptibilities to environmental conditions, such as\r\nextreme temperature events.\r\nLife history characteristics of macroalgae, such as reproduction, growth, maximum size and\r\nmortality can likewise be parametrised.\r\nFor more details on the program see also:\r\nKubicek A, Muhando C, Reuter H (2012) Simulations of Long-Term Community Dynamics in Coral Reefs - How Perturbations Shape Trajectories.
