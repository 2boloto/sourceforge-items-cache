A 73- or 88-note, MIDI-equipped piano is required to play.  There are 18 levels for each of the 12 keys.\r\n\r\nSightSPEED teaches note recognition.  Other components of sight reading (rhythm, meter, dynamics) are not covered, but it is assumed that players will pick these elements up naturally from playing real music.\r\n\r\nSightSPEED is designed around four-part vocal pieces (a.k.a. SATB scores), which are said to be the best material for sight-reading practice.  Hymnals contain tons of songs in four-part harmony.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years of playing piano by ear, I grew tired of being limited by my hearing skills and decided to learn to read music.  I tried learning by reading real songs, but I found it annoying, so I started experimenting with randomly-generated exercizes because I found them less frustrating.
