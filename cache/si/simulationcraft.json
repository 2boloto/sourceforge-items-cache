The goal of this simulator is to close the accuracy gap while maintaining a performance level high enough to calculate relative stat weights to aid gear selection.\r\n\r\nSimulationCraft allows raid/party creation of arbitrary size, generating detailed charts and reports for both individual and raid performance.\r\n\r\nA simple graphical interface is included with the tool, allowing players to download and analyze characters from the Armory. It can also be run from the command-line in which case the player profiles are specified via parameter files.", "shortname": "simulationcraft", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "a tool to explore combat mechanics in World of Warcraft (tm)", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2051664}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/simulationcraft/", "video_url": ""}
