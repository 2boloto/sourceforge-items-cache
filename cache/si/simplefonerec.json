It needs LAME, and LineInCode to do the actual work - the script basically tide them together.

For example, if you run the script from 0800 to 2000 in one go (without any interruption in between), all the calls will be saved in 1 file.\r\n\r\nTo make it more robust, you can install NC_NET on the clients computer and setup Nagios to monitor them. ;-)\r\n\r\nHope it helps!\r\n\r\nCheers.", "shortname": "simplefonerec", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple Fone Recorder", "tools": [{"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1889778}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/simplefonerec/", "video_url": ""}
