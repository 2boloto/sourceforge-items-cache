It allows the deployment of wireless reconfigurable ad-hoc networks and MANETs, assisted by a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) for network traffic monitoring and management of radio electric features of the links established between the active network nodes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed tool allows analyzing the delay, traffic flows and packet losses for both the full network and\r\nsingle nodes. This functionality enables to determine the causes constraining the QoS accomplishment for a particular networktopology, scenario, routing algorithm, and so on.\r\n\r\nDue to a set of functionalities, such as GUI, network topology visualization, traffic and motion pattern configuration, and real-time network status analysis, the simulator here introduced becomes a valid tool for both research and education targets.", "shortname": "simumanet", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "SimuMANET is a tool for deployment and real-time monitoring of MANETs", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 810575}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/simumanet/", "video_url": ""}
