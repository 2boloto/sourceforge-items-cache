The goal of this project has been the development of a simulation tool for recommendation system of extracurricular activities on a university campus. This simulation provides the advantage to avoid problems that may develop during a real implementation and operation of this system.\r\n\r\nIt is simulated a recommendation system of extracurricular activities for students of a university campus considering their free time (time between classes) and preferences (interest, hobbies). It is presented a model of the UCAM university campus but the tool can be extrapolated to any other university campus because it is fully configurable.\r\n\r\nThe developed tool can also optimize the number of elements necessary for recommendation system and the total number of students who may be informed until the system reaches its saturation level.
