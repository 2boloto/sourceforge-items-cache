Each of these systems will require that the user remembers separate login credentials to gain access. This could be tiresome in many occasions. The Single Signon idea addresses this problem. A major advantage Single Signon [1] offers is in terms of improved user experience, better manageability and more stringent policies to safeguard security. Single Signon has seen a lot of implementations in the Web Services domain. Example: User can sign in to a common interface once, which will grant him direct access to several services housed within the interface.", "shortname": "single-sign-on", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Single Signon For Virtual Machines (VMs) in an Administrative Domain", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "sso", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 753877}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/single-sign-on/", "video_url": ""}
