Code is generated that automatically traverses the parse tree and calls a method on a transformer object to modify the parse tree. Each node is visited in document order, and a method is called at the beginning and end of each node visit. This transformer class is subclassed for customization.\r\n\r\nSimpleCompiler has many built-in feature for supporting a variety of text based language.\r\n", "shortname": "simple-compiler", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "@SimpleCompiler1", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Tools for creating code generators.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1251352}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/simple-compiler/", "video_url": ""}
