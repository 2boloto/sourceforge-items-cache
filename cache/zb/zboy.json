Here you can see a comparison between graphic algorithms supported by zBoy. This is also one of the very few GameBoy emulators that provides a 2-gameboys link emulation, which makes it possible to play some games in 2-players mode on a LAN.\r\n\r\nThe emulator is available for Linux, DOS and Windows (but should compile for other systems, too).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "zboy", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/userid-1220451/", "username": "mv_fox", "name": "Mateusz Viste"}], "external_homepage": "http://zboy.sourceforge.net/"}
