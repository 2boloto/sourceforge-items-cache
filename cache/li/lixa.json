LIXA is a Transaction Manager but it's not a Transaction Monitor: this is the distinguishing feature of the project. LIXA technology enables every application container, like a web server or a shell, to become an XA compliant application server. The client/server architecture of LIXA allows many application containers to share a single LIXA (state) server: this is ideal when horizontal scalability is a must and many identical application containers must refer to a single transactional environment. Performance, scalability and high availability are key features of the project. LIXA can be used with the C, C++, and PHP programming languages.", "shortname": "lixa", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "LIXA, LIbre XA, is a free and open source XA transaction manager", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 257602}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "BUG", "mount_point": "bug", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "RFNF", "mount_point": "rfnf", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lixa/", "video_url": ""}
