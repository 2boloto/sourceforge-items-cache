When building large-scale models of whole subcellular environments, models of lipid membranes with carefully considered, biologically relevant curvature are essential. LipidWrapper, written by Jacob Durrant in the lab of Rommie E. Amaro, is capable of creating curved membrane models with geometries derived from various possible sources, both experimental and theoretical. We are hopeful that this utility will be a useful tool for the computational-biology community.", "shortname": "lipidwrapper", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Create lipid-bilayer models of arbitrary geometry.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1925757}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lipidwrapper/", "video_url": null}
