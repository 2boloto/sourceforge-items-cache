LIME is intended to be especially useful when separate computer codes (which may be written in any standard computer language) already exist to solve di\u000bfferent parts of a multiphysics problem. LIME provides the key high-level software (written in C++), a well defi\fned approach (with example templates), and interface requirements to enable the assembly of multiple physics codes into a single coupled-physics simulation code.\r\n\r\nTo achieve its flexible lightweight design objectives, LIME 1.0 requires that some amount of customized software be written each time a new multiphysics application is created. Also, modest high-level revisions or modifications to most stand-alone physics codes may be required to meet interface requirements. Detailed descriptions of these requirements together with example cases are provided in a users guide.", "shortname": "lime1", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "LIME is a software tool for creating multiphysics simulation codes.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 744358}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lime1/", "video_url": ""}
