It is the much needed modern replacement for the aging platform-specific clients with many new enhancements.\r\n\r\nThe highest goal of the LinJam project is to flatten the pro-audio learning-curve; easing the intimidation that most non-technical musicians experience when they are first introduced to NINJAM.  Some of the ways proposed to accomplish this include: offering a minimal interface with some reasonable default settings, some normalizing/conditioning features such as auto-gain and limiter, and the option to elect a \"sound man\".  It is hoped that these, and its other convenience features will encourage musicians without prior experience in audio production (which today is essentially a pre-requisite) to engage with the bliss that is NINJAM.", "shortname": "linjam", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A cross platform NINJAM client with linear chain-streaming mode", "tools": [{"label": "Discussion Forum", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2442926}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/linjam/", "video_url": null}
