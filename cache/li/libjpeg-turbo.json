In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.\r\n\r\nlibjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API.  libjpeg-turbo also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java interface.\r\n", "shortname": "libjpeg-turbo", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library", "tools": [{"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 303195}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Patches", "mount_point": "patches", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Feature Requests", "mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Bugs", "mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/libjpeg-turbo/", "video_url": null}
