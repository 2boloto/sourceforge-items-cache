Truth is that it just started as an activity with no target; and is still faulty. I decided to show it up now, and soon i may upload also the code... it needs a 'bit' of clean up. (feel free to message me if you need it)\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a program to create musical patterns whose composition method is based on algorythms of a sort which i observed in lots of music. You build it up from objects called 'licogs' which are connected toegether to generate chains; the good thing is that some of them have different functions from just 'sounding'. They can alter the constant repetition, to generate variation of that repetition. If you want to understand it better, please download a copy. It's free.
