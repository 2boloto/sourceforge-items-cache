I have done this work in the research purpose to analyze an ability of development a serious mass enterprise system on very perspective and great Virgo platform couple with the most powerful open source portal Liferay. My theoretical research has pointed these two product like the most perspective flexible and multi functional solutions matching my aims very well. But practically Virgo has turned out inapplicable for my tasks for a lot of different reasons (low performance, inconvenient migration process, poor environment, not enough functionality of tools, low robust, poor documentation and etc.) If someone want to know in details I can formalize everything on the forum by a request.\r\nI have published this project with hope that it might save efforts, time and money from waste for someone.\r\nSee the file repository and the readme files.
