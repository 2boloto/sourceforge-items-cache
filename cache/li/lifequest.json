You simply enter the things you want to do, along with priority and date information, and LifeQuest does the rest.\r\n\r\nUnlike other ToDo list programs, LifeQuest aims to minimise the amount of effort you spend entering information.  LifeQuest is also inspired by GTD contexts and projects to help you find things to do wherever you are or whichever project you want to focus on.\r\n\r\nLifeQuest is also motivational!  Your ToDo list is a Quest, your projects are Adventures, and your contexts are Locations.
