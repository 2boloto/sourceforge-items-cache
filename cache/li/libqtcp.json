It wraps the capabilities related to networking in simple to use, service based server and client configurations.\r\n\r\nThe library starts with the tcp protocol as it is implemented in the QtNetwork module[1]  and creates two top level managing structures: a client and a server. Both support multiple connections that may or may not be encrypted.\r\n\r\nOn top of this basic framework we implement the service support. Any server may host any number of services that are identified by their names in the client-server connection.\r\n\r\nThe source contains simple igu8i based implementations for both a client and a server. \r\n\r\n[1] http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtnetwork.html", "shortname": "libqtcp", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Library that provides communication over a network", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1279155}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/libqtcp/", "video_url": ""}
