Currently versions 3.0, 3.2 and 3.3 are supported as well as support for the *draft* V4.0 CIGI standard. Additional functionality to the base packet interfaces is provided through external classes so that to the packet headers have no further dependencies.\r\nPacket processing is kept simple and a couple of simple helper functions / classes are provided in CIGIGeneric.h and some other headers to support this.\r\nHelpers are provided for version interpretation and conversion of packet parameters to text.\r\nTesting is supported using the boost test framework to develop unit tests for each of the packets.\r\nBecause the library is header-only it can easily support many platforms / compilers but this has not yet been tested.
