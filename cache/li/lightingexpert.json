After months of development, design, product organisation and test runs the finished product is now live, and the customers, as well as the Lighting Majestic staff, couldn\u2019t be happier with the result. It has been an arduous process but a fulfilling one as the improvements were certainly worth the effort. This new website much easier to navigate, and as for product choice, the difference between our old website and are new one is staggering, whereas the old website had a little over 2,000 products to choose from, the new Lightingmajestic.com has over 7,000!  Covering all manner of fittings from ceiling lights to floor lamps and of course the popular Tiffany Lighting.", "shortname": "lightingexpert", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Lighting Advice Blog powerd by Lighting Majestic ltd", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 757511}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/lightingexpert/", "video_url": ""}
