They have since then evolved into a general-purpose tool for binary program testing, profiling, and security restriction. The sandbox libraries are currently maintained by the OpenJudge Alliance (http://openjudge.net/) as a standalone, open-source project to facilitate various assignment grading solutions for IT/CS education.\r\n\r\nSee project page at https://github.com/openjudge/sandbox for details.", "shortname": "libsandbox", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 156437}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "News", "mount_point": "news", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Donate", "mount_point": "donate", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/libsandbox/", "video_url": ""}
