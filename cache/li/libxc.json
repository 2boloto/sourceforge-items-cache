The extended C library is intended to make some headway into providing this functionality. To ensure unrestricted usage the libxc project is provided under the very permissive BSD license. If you need a different license then please send me a request (lelanthran at gmail) and I'll do my best to satisfy your request.\r\n\r\nWhat's completed?\r\nAs of writing, the following libraries have been written and tested:\r\n1. Memory accounting/tracking\r\n2. String operations\r\n3. Vectors\r\n4. Trees\r\n5. Dictionary arrays\r\n6.
