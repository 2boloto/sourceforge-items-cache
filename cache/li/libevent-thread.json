This is fine, except that it is basically single-threaded -- which means that if you have multiple CPUs or a CPU with hyperthreading, you're really under-utilizing the CPU resources available to your server application because your event pump is running in a single thread and therefore can only use one CPU core at a time.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to create one libevent event queues (AKA event_base) per active connection, each with its own event pump thread.  This project does exactly that, giving you everything you need to write high-performance, multi-threaded, libevent-based socket servers.\r\n", "shortname": "libevent-thread", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Everything you need to implement a threaded, libevent-based server.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 731034}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/libevent-thread/", "video_url": ""}
