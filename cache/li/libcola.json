It abstracts away locking and threading from the developer and allows safe concurrent or exclusive access to resources.  \r\n\r\nThe developer can spend more effort concentrating on tasks, their relative priorities and the resources required to achieve them, rather than queues, mutexes and thread management.  In shifting the focus to tasks and resources the goal is to provide greater concurrency and reliability of multi-threaded applications with less development effort.\r\n\r\nUnlike many other concurrency API's it requires no compiler extensions or special hardware.  LibCola is both cross-platform and vendor neutral.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "libcola", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Concurrent Object Locking Abstraction library for C++", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1187479}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/libcola/", "video_url": ""}
