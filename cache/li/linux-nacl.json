There is several hurdles to overcome in order to get a standard linux distribution to run under NaCl.\r\nThere is a library called nacl_io in the Google NaCl sdk. It mimics the function of a posix files and sockets on top of ppapi. Similarly in naclports there is a crude nacl-spawn library which mimics processes by creating multiple nacl modules with javascript acting as a sort of \"kernel\". \r\nCurrently the main holes that prevent a conventional distro from being ported is that there is no support for pipes, most signals, and also symbolic links and lastly traditional forks are not currently possible in an efficent way.The current implementation gets around forking and has limited vfork capability.\r\nPlease join this project to help implement fixes for these issues so we can get your favorite distro to run at nearly native speed!", "shortname": "linux-nacl", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Linux Distro to run under Google's NaCl Sandbox", "tools": [{"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2277870}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Google NaCl", "mount_point": "SVN", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/linux-nacl/", "video_url": null}
