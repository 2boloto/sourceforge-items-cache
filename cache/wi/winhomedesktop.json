Why not use it like a regular PC when you need extra PCs for visiting family members who are used to Windows Vista/7 without intimidating them.  Plus it is green as the Home Server is on anyways, might as well use it.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "winhomedesktop", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/meredithgrace/", "username": "meredithgrace", "name": "Meredith Grace"}], "external_homepage": ""}
