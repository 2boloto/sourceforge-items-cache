We created a new approach to methylation analysis based on shape-similarity that finds stronger associations between methylation and expression than previously observed.\r\n\r\nWIMSi includes both DISCOVERY and GENE LIST tools.  The DISCOVERY tool is designed to discover patterns of methylation that correlate with differential expression, with minimal prior assumptions about what patterns should exist in the data. The GENE LIST tool is designed to take advantage of the patterns found to elucidate genes likely regulated by DNA methylation.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wimsi", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/edwards-wustl/", "username": "edwards-wustl", "name": "jedwards.wustl"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/cschlosberg/", "username": "cschlosberg", "name": "Christopher Schlosberg"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ndvk1980/", "username": "ndvk1980", "name": "Nathan VanderKraats"}], "external_homepage": "http://epigenomics.wustl.edu/WIMSi/"}
