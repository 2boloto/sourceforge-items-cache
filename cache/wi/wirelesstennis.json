The project uses two Dragon12-Plus2SM boards equipped with a nRF24L01+ transceiver adapter from Addicore. \r\nThe project depicts a \"wireless tennis game\". The purpose of the game is for users to type button patterns and \"pass\" them to the opponent. The opponent has a brief moment to see the pattern being played on the LEDs and then he needs to retype the pattern. If retype was correct, a new pattern is \"passed back\" just like a tennis ball is passed by the players from one court to the other.", "shortname": "wirelesstennis", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Wireless Tennis Game for Dragon12 Plus with nRF24L01+", "tools": [{"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2430753}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wirelesstennis/", "video_url": null}
