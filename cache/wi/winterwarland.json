This game contains a leveling system where after each level you get to upgrade nine different features of your character relating to your gloves, boots, and coat.\r\n\r\nDuring a battle, there is an inventory system where you can store snowballs and an assortment of eight different powerup items in your pockets so you can use them whenever you want.\r\n\r\nWinter Warland features four different game modes, including the classic Deathmatch (standard snowball fight), Elimination, and Capture the Flag modes as well as a unique mode called Snowman Conqueror. Worlds are randomly generated, but are customizable.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer was intended, but due to severe delays and recent schedule changes, I probably wonâ€™t add it for a while.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "winterwarland", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/zicronsoft/", "username": "zicronsoft", "name": "Peter Schmidt"}], "external_homepage": "http://zicronsoft.comxa.com/2011/games/winter-warland/"}
