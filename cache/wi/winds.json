Since i started coding Apps for the NDS, my goal was to write a program, called WinDS, which does (nearly) the same as the real appy by Microsoft. In contrast to other little NDS-Operating Systems, just like Woopsi etc. you can code your own Application in Lua for WinDS: just copy the Code onto the FAT-Disk and execute it from within WinDS! This is what makes WinDS so unique.\r\n\r\nThe New Beta 0.95 is out, it features\r\n\r\n- 52 Classes that are already available within Lua\r\n- 25 different types of user interface classes\r\n- 8 different predefined dialogs\r\nwhich makes it the perfect GUI sandbox for DS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: More time without update means: next update will have even more improvements, as i am still developing ;)", "shortname": "winds", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Windows XP ported to Nintendo DS", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 728996}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/winds/", "video_url": null}
