It is highly recommended that before an image is written to a device, the user should do a Read to a temporary file first.  If this fails, please report the failure along with your system information (file a new bug, NOT a review).\r\n\r\nPlease do not use the reviews area for questions or bugs, as I have no way of responding to them.\r\n\r\nBear with us as we transition from launchpad.net.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "win32diskimager", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gruemaster/", "username": "gruemaster", "name": "Tobin Davis"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/skydvr68/", "username": "skydvr68", "name": "Jeff B"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/tuxinator2009/", "username": "tuxinator2009", "name": "Justin (Tuxinator) Davis"}], "external_homepage": null}
