This is a spin-off of a project of controlling a inteliport III. I got lazy and will just use mp3 files to do the job. All programmers are basically lazy. This program is written using windows API calls and works on 32/64 bit systems (apple macbook pro using win 7 32 bit pro and also a 64 bit hp computer running win 7 ultimate 64. I did find out this had problems running on a 32 bit eeepc 901 running winXp with a realtek HD audio outputâ€¦I concluded this to driver problems.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "windowssoundgenerator", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gbmiller/", "username": "gbmiller", "name": "gbmiller"}], "external_homepage": "http://windowssoundgenerator.sourceforge.net"}
