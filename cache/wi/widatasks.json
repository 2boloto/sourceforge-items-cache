So when building tasks, you first create \"definitions\" of the triggers, conditions and actions. This program gives you the ability to code up a form for each definition, which would pass parameters to the trigger, condition or action itself, allowing the user to define their own parameters on task creation. After the definitions have been coded up, there is no longer a need of any coding knowledge allowing regular users to make use of this program. You can simply create a task where you would mix and match the definitions so the task behaves the way you intended.\r\n\r\nThe definitions/tasks can separately be exported/imported between clients, allowing the more \u201cknowledgeable\u201d users to create libraries of definitions or tasks.", "shortname": "widatasks", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "This is a platform for an extremely powerful/versatile task scheduler.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 758563}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/widatasks/", "video_url": ""}
