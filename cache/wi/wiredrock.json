Nominally the basis for the start up is to create and utilize a best of breed service desk ticketing system that plays to the strengths of current ticketing systems but aims to eliminate the parts that, well, suck.  The system will be one part CRM and one part servicedesk with the ability to be expanded and hooked into other systems via an extensible plugin framework.  The system will be secure, fast, and lite weight working on IIS and Apache through PHP and possibly ASP technology.  This will be 100% web based for all aspects of control, viewing, etc. Additionally, Wired Rock is currently crafting some Active Directory tools to allow quick and easy bulk editing, adding and removal of users as there are no decent free tools to do so (that we've found).", "shortname": "wiredrock", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "abandoned", "summary": "Providing IT tools that just don't suck", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 841882}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/wiredrock/", "video_url": null}
