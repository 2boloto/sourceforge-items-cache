It is developped in C and available under the BSD license.\r\n\r\nIt splits a list of directories and file trees into a certain number of\r\npartitions, trying to produce partitions with the same size and number of files.\r\nIt can also produce partitions with a given number of files or a limited size.\r\n\r\nOnce generated, partitions are either printed as file lists to stdout (default)\r\nor to files. Those lists can then be used by third party programs.\r\n\r\nFpart also includes a live mode, which allows it to crawl very large filesystems\r\nand produce partitions in live. Hooks are available to act on those partitions\r\n(e.g. immediatly start a transfer using rsync(1)) without having to wait for\r\nthe filesystem traversal job to be finished. Used this way, fpart can be seen\r\nas a powerful data migration tool.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fpart", "_id": "4ec67f78b9363c43e0000e9d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 631100, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Sort files and pack them into partitions", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: File Management", "shortname": "file_management", "fullname": "File Management", "id": 601}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving :: Backup", "shortname": "backup", "fullname": "Backup", "id": 137}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Filesystems", "shortname": "filesystems", "fullname": "Filesystems", "id": 142}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Solaris", "shortname": "sun", "fullname": "Solaris", "id": 207}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: FreeBSD", "shortname": "freebsd", "fullname": "FreeBSD", "id": 203}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: NetBSD", "shortname": "netbsd", "fullname": "NetBSD", "id": 204}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}]}}
