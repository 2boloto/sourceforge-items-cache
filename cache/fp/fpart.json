It is developped in C and available under the BSD license.\r\n\r\nIt splits a list of directories and file trees into a certain number of\r\npartitions, trying to produce partitions with the same size and number of files.\r\nIt can also produce partitions with a given number of files or a limited size.\r\n\r\nOnce generated, partitions are either printed as file lists to stdout (default)\r\nor to files. Those lists can then be used by third party programs.\r\n\r\nFpart also includes a live mode, which allows it to crawl very large filesystems\r\nand produce partitions in live. Hooks are available to act on those partitions\r\n(e.g. immediatly start a transfer using rsync(1)) without having to wait for\r\nthe filesystem traversal job to be finished. Used this way, fpart can be seen\r\nas a powerful data migration tool.", "shortname": "fpart", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Sort files and pack them into partitions", "tools": [{"label": "Home", "mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 631100}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/fpart/", "video_url": ""}
