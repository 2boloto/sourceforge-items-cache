All of them in native code and whenever possible with the same modular structure.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "fpotencia", "_id": "5468d59db9363c584df6f621", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2363962, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "Power flow library in C++", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Simulations", "shortname": "simulations", "fullname": "Simulations", "id": 600}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Library :: Research", "shortname": "research", "fullname": "Research", "id": 819}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)", "shortname": "mpl20", "fullname": "Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)", "id": 905}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
