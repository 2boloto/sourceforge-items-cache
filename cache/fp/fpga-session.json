This has led to the development and deployment of systems consisting of multiple FPGAs. These systems are advancing from scores of FPGAs to hundreds of FPGAs. Programming and administering\r\nthese kind of systems while maintaining a non-intrusive physical footprint is expected to remain a continuing challenge. Future systems demand lower FPGA configuration and initialization turn-around times while maintaining a high degree of resource availability. Also, support for new configuration methodologies and portability to the latest generations of FPGA platforms is required.
