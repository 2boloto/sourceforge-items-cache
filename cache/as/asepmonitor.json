ASEPMonitor works in conjunction with the autorunsc utility developed by Mark Russinovich, a utility that is a part of the Sysinternals suite of utility programs for the Windows platform.\r\n\r\nASEPMonitor can be used on all version of Windows but at the present time it is not code-signed, so attempts to use it on Vista, Win7, Win8, or Server 2008 (or above) with UAC enabled may cause the program to fail. A code-signed version will be available as soon as I can afford to purchase a code-signing certificate.\r\n\r\nASEPMonitor comes with an example config file, the executable program itself, and an installation document that explains how to install and configure ASEPMonitor. Autorunsc must be downloaded separately from the Microsoft Sysinternals website.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "asepmonitor", "_id": "507302631be1ce390e1806ef", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1004407, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A Windows malware detection system", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Security :: Anti-Malware", "shortname": "antimalware", "fullname": "Anti-Malware", "id": 745}], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
