It proved not only to reduce the grading workload, but also improved the lab completion rates among students, and grades overall improved as a result. Since it has turned out to be such a successful tool, it is now released under the AGPL license for others to use in their classrooms. Planned improvements include: automatic plagiarism detection, making the student interface prettier, and supporting other testing frameworks and languages.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "asgnmtgrader", "_id": "4f2520561be1ce4fad000723", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "src", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 679469, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A webapp that collects and grades student labs", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 71}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Testing", "shortname": "testing", "fullname": "Testing", "id": 73}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Computer Aided Instruction (CAI)", "shortname": "cai", "fullname": "Computer Aided Instruction (CAI)", "id": 72}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Affero GNU Public License", "shortname": "agpl", "fullname": "Affero GNU Public License", "id": 670}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Database API :: SQL-based", "shortname": "db_api_sql", "fullname": "SQL-based", "id": 508}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "shortname": "independent", "fullname": "OS Independent (Written in an interpreted language)", "id": 235}]}}
