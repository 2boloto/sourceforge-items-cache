ASIL (pronounced \"a-sill\") was largely inspired by BASIC.  However, instead of starting with a modern verison of BASIC, I started with AppleSoft.  Why?  Well, ASIL was born in the early 1990s while I was in college.  I knew AppleSoft quite well as it was my first programming language.  ASIL nearly died then as the compiler technology wasn't up to the job.  Now, I figure those compilers might be able to do the job.  ASIL now incorporates features from C++, C#, modern BASICs, and Java.\r\n\r\nYet, if you look at sample code, it clearly isn't any of those.  In fact, even though it's \"derived from BASIC\", it's relationship to modern BASIC dialects like VB is more like a very distant cousin.  You might have troubles calling \"BASIC\" once you see sample code.\r\n\r\nWe have an IRC channel: ircs://irc.freenode.net/asil-language.
