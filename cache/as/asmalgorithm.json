Previously, we designed \r\nan exact subgraph matching (ESM) algorithm for dependency graphs using a backtracking approach \r\n(http://esmalgorithm.sourceforge.net). We further designed an approximate subgraph matching (ASM) \r\nalgorithm that is capable of detecting approximate subgraph matching based on a subgraph \r\ndistance. Assume that the graph G and the subgraph Gs have m and n vertices, and km and kn edges \r\nrespectively, the total worst-case algorithm complexity is O(m^n * n(n-1)/2 * km * log m). \r\n\r\nThis Java implementation implements our ASM algorithm.
