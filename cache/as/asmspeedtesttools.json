In this case for NULL registers few time ago. But results do not satisfy me as well. Then i decide to make own experiment and measure speed of processing on CPU Intel Pentium D with System CentOS 6.4. I developed some applications and tools for that reason. To reduce adjust of measurements you should stop all not necesary applications and leave system clean so much as possible also run tests as root.
