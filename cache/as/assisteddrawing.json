It is intended to make maths up to Key Stage 4 more accessible.  AQA has agreed to its use in a GCSE maths exam. Anyone who can use a computer with a mouse to access the internet should be able to use ARO.\r\n \r\nThe processes required mimic those of on paper drawing as far as possible. Possible applications include:\r\nGraphs of straight lines and smooth curves\r\nCompass and ruler constructions\r\nScatter graphs\r\nStem and leaf displays\r\nBox plots\r\nHistograms\r\nPie charts\r\nSimple diagrams.\r\n\r\nThe structure of each drawing is built from individual components which can be placed on the drawing grid without great accuracy.  Each can then be positioned exactly using onscreen buttons.  The ruler and the protractor can be aligned with any straight line.  Drawings can be created on imported background bitmaps.\r\n\r\nThe author was a mathematics lecturer at Plymouth University. \r\n\r\n", "summary": "ARO helps physically disabled students to create mathematical drawings", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1700256, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": null, "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "assisteddrawing", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/hazel-shute/", "username": "hazel-shute", "name": "Hazel Shute"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/assisteddrawing/screenshot/drawing%20a%20pie%20chart.png", "caption": "Drawing a pie chart", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/assisteddrawing/screenshot/drawing%20a%20pie%20chart.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/assisteddrawing/screenshot/equilateral%20triangle%20construction.png", "caption": "Constructing an equilateral triangle of side 7cm", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/assisteddrawing/screenshot/equilateral%20triangle%20construction.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/assisteddrawing/screenshot/improving%20a%20smooth%20curve.png", "caption": "Adding a point to a smooth curve", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/assisteddrawing/screenshot/improving%20a%20smooth%20curve.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": null, "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: X Window System (X11)", "fullname": "X Window System (X11)", "shortname": "x11", "id": 229}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "id": 230}, {"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: TabletPC", "fullname": "TabletPC", "shortname": "ui_tabletpc", "id": 476}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Visual Basic .NET", "fullname": "Visual Basic .NET", "shortname": "vb_net", "id": 453}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Public Domain", "fullname": "Public Domain", "shortname": "publicdomain", "id": 197}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics", "fullname": "Mathematics", "shortname": "mathematics", "id": 98}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Testing", "fullname": "Testing", "shortname": "testing", "id": 73}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics :: Statistics", "fullname": "Statistics", "shortname": "statistics", "id": 826}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "fullname": "Education", "shortname": "education", "id": 360}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "id": 655}]}}
