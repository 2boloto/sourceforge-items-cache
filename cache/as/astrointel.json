For the most part all responses found within any engine have been pre-made to produce the same response each and everytime condition A is met. What if the response was decided by the time of day, the day of the month and month of the year, as well as nine diffrent floating variables that changes their value constantly?\r\n\r\n    They say that our lives are based on Astrological influnce, if its true or not no one person can say, but it is a complex mathmatical formula that requires years to master. The goal of this project is to establish a engine which functions in the same manner that astrology influnces the human.
