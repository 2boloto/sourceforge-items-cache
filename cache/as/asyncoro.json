Asynchronous completions implemented in asyncoro are sockets (non-blocking sockets), database cursors, sleep timers and locking primitives. Programs developed with asyncoro have same logic and structure as Python programs with threads, except for a few syntactic changes. asyncoro supports socket I/O notification mechanisms epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll (and poll and select, where necessary), and Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) for high performance and scalability, and SSL for security", "summary": "Python framework for asynchronous, concurrent, distributed programming", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 751430, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "asyncoro", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/pgiri/", "username": "pgiri", "name": "Giridhar Pemmasani"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "http://asyncoro.sourceforge.net/index.html", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "id": 11}], "environment": [], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "fullname": "Python", "shortname": "python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: MIT License", "fullname": "MIT License", "shortname": "mit", "id": 188}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "id": 606}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Clustering", "fullname": "Clustering", "shortname": "clustering", "id": 141}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Distributed Computing", "fullname": "Distributed Computing", "shortname": "distributed_computing", "id": 308}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "fullname": "System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "fullname": "Architects", "shortname": "architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "id": 436}]}}
