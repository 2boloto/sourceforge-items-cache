Asynchronous completions implemented in asyncoro are sockets (non-blocking sockets), database cursors, sleep timers and locking primitives. Programs developed with asyncoro have same logic and structure as Python programs with threads, except for a few syntactic changes. asyncoro supports socket I/O notification mechanisms epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll (and poll and select, where necessary), and Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) for high performance and scalability, and SSL for security", "shortname": "asyncoro", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Python framework for asynchronous, concurrent, distributed programming", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 751430}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/asyncoro/", "video_url": ""}
