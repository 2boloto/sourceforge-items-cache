It has a large generic component plus modules to refine it for different game systems (e.g. HarnMaster, HERO, AD&D) and to simulate weather, combat, character generation, etc.\r\n\r\nImportant: Just released v0.9 breaks database compatibility with v0.8.  I don't think this actually affects anyone (since as far as I know, nobody is actively using this but me) but wanted to make that clear.  Anyway, you'll need to drop all items from characters before you upgrade and re-add them back afterwards.  This shouldn't happen again.\r\n\r\nI've just started doing work on this again after a hiatus of about 5 years.
