More precisely, it does type checking, data-flow analysis, and it automatically correlates the results of these two types of analysis. Type checking is used for finding bugs on the way integers are handled, and data-flow analysis is used to see if hazardous functions (eg. memcpy, strcpy) are accessible from outside the program.\r\n\r\nAfter this two analyses, the tool correlates the results from the previous phases to attain if the data that comes from the inputs are affected by vulnerabilities from porting to LP64, and if these are handled by dangerous functions (memcpy, strcpy,...).
