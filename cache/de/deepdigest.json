It calculates hash values for selected files and allows the files to be verified against those values. Its GUI interface provides several features not found in similar programs. Roughly speaking, DeepDigest is a GUI version of md5deep/sha1deep/sha256deep. \r\n\r\nTo use DeepDigest, a user first creates a \"job\". This specifies the directory to be hashed and the hash algorithm to be used (MD5, SHA-1 or SHA-256). The results of a job run are saved to an archive file. Subsequent runs of the job are compared to this archive to determine which files have changed. New, deleted, renamed or moved files are also reported. The results view may be sorted, filtered and searched.  \r\n\r\nResults may be exported in csv format or to another installation of DeepDigest.\r\n \r\nDeepDigest may be run from the command line and from scripts. The name of the job to be run is passed as a command line argument.\r\n\r\nDeepDigest is written in C++ and uses the Qt libraries. \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "deepdigest", "_id": "4f6dda29b9363c66ac000637", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 730910, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A file integrity checker.
