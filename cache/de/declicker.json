Many of the disks have scratches that impose needles to make little jumps producing short sharp noises named 'clicks'. My project's aim was to create a free software able to remove this kind of noise from audio files produced by capturing vinyl disk. Also it was presumed the developed program might to detect start positions and lengths of clicks and to replace the damaged samples with interpolated ones automatically. Beside of this the possibility to handle with directories of audio files seemed to be useful. So these functionalities are released at present time.\r\nNote: the program needs CUDA compatible NVIDIA GPU. Read WIKI for the details\r\nUPD 2015-03-15: Also the app was tested with some  tracks contained \"bit rot\"", "shortname": "declicker", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "This program removes clicks from audio files", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2028621}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/declicker/", "video_url": null}
