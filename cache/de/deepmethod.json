The Differential Evolution Entirely Parallel method takes into account the individual age, that is defined as the number of iterations the individual survived without changes. The introduced improvements are: (I) allow several oldest individuals to be overwritten by the same number of best ones in the population, (II) new selection rule uses several objective functions in offspring evaluation.\r\n\r\nThis work is supported by RNF Grant 14-14-00302 and by \u201c5-100-2020\u201d Program of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science.\r\n\r\nThe previous funding included  SYSPATHO FP7 project \u2116260429, RFBR grants 10-01-00627-a, 11-01-00573-a, 11-04-001162-a and State Contract with Russian Ministry of Science \u211614.740.11.0166 and \u211611.519.11.6041 \r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "deepmethod", "_id": "505aac8d1be1ce7fecc13ac7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 959001, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}], "summary": "Differential Evolution Entirely Parallel Method", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "id": 97}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Molecular Science", "shortname": "molecular_science", "fullname": "Molecular Science", "id": 609}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
