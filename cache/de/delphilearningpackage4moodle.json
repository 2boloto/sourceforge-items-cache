The methodology implemented using DLP is based on the well known strategic consultancy method called Delphi. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method\r\nThe Delphi method is a structured communication technique, originally developed as a systematic, interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of experts.The experts answer questionnaires in two or more rounds. After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the experts\u2019 forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments. Using DLP you can integrate a Delphi communication process into your learning environment as part as a collaborative learning process.
