A web-based Graphical User Interface is included. \r\n\r\nThe analysis proceeds as such: gapped alignments are performed and corrected for length, PCR and fragment bias so that a Fragment Per (effective) Kilobase per Million of reads (FPKM) is estimated as well as the simpler Reads Per Kb per Million of reads (RPKM). When provided with multiple isoforms and in the \u2018contextual\u2019 mode, corrections include a expectation maximization algorithm estimates effective expression profiles and a corrected alignment is produced. For each gene the user provides, DEW computes coverage descriptive statistics (RPKM, FKMP and total, mean and median corrected counts), expression profiles (normalized as R/FPKM and trimmed mean of fold change). DEW allows users to explore the data by providing interactive graphs.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "dew", "_id": "50ea5c4324b0d925e92ac958", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "demos", "name": "git", "label": "demos"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1215334, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "DEW is a platform that allows users to explore RNA-Seq data", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Perl", "shortname": "perl", "fullname": "Perl", "id": 176}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: S/R", "shortname": "s_slash_r", "fullname": "S/R", "id": 573}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: SQLite", "shortname": "db_net_sqlite", "fullname": "SQLite", "id": 531}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
