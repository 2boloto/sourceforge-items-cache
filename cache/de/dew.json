A web-based Graphical User Interface is included. \r\n\r\nThe analysis proceeds as such: gapped alignments are performed and corrected for length, PCR and fragment bias so that a Fragment Per (effective) Kilobase per Million of reads (FPKM) is estimated as well as the simpler Reads Per Kb per Million of reads (RPKM). When provided with multiple isoforms and in the \u2018contextual\u2019 mode, corrections include a expectation maximization algorithm estimates effective expression profiles and a corrected alignment is produced. For each gene the user provides, DEW computes coverage descriptive statistics (RPKM, FKMP and total, mean and median corrected counts), expression profiles (normalized as R/FPKM and trimmed mean of fold change).
