We propose a deterministic energy-efficient clustering protocol that is dynamic,\r\ndistributive, self-organizing and more energy efficient than the existing protocols. It utilizes a simplified approach which minimizes\r\ncomputational overhead-cost to self-organize the sensor network. Our simulation result shows a better performance with respect to energy consumption, which is reflected in the network\r\nlifetime in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings when compared with the existing protocols. It is worthy of note that our approach approximates an ideal solution for balanced energy consumption in hierarchical wireless sensor networks.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "decprotocol", "_id": "51262ca3ea406b609cd64693", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1291724, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A Deterministic Energy-efficient Clustering protocol for WSN", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "shortname": "communications", "fullname": "Communications", "id": 20}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Networking :: Routing", "shortname": "routing", "fullname": "Routing", "id": 857}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Telecommunications Industry", "shortname": "telecommunications", "fullname": "Telecommunications Industry", "id": 368}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": []}}
