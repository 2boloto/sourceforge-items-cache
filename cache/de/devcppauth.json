Perfect for student homeworks, if you don't want your students to copy their homework files from others.\r\n\r\nIntroducing Homework files. These are regular source files with student's name and a security hash added at the end. Any cheating attempt by copying in the files / changing name will invalidate the hash and can be detected by the teacher. In addition, paste in authenticated files is only allowed from one's own files.\r\n\r\nThe hash is computed using the binary AuthDLL.dll file provided.\r\n\r\nThe CheckHash.exe tool checks the hash and reports the authentication status of of all .cpp files in the current directory. This tool is intended for teachers.\r\n\r\nHow to install: overwrite devcpp.exe in the installation folder (don't forget to backup before). Add AuthDLL.dll in the same folder.\r\n\r\nDev-C++ for Homeworks is based on Orwell's Dev-Cpp repository.
