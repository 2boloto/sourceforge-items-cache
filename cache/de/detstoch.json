It allows the user to play with an intuitive GUI framework and compute the evolution rates of the chemical reactions with the different methods available. The results are displayed in graphical plots of the species concentration over the time. \r\n\r\nThe package is designed to solve any of the following reactions by either one of the two approaches mentioned:\r\n\r\nSynthesis-Decompostion Reaction\r\nChain Reaction \r\nNuclear Chemical Reaction\r\nLodka Model\r\nBrusselator Model\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Stochastic approach can be computed by several stochastic simulation algorithms. The DetStoch package offers four  stochastic algorithms that use probability functions simulated via Monte Carlo methods: Gillespie's Direct Method, Gillespie's First Reaction Method, Bruck and Gibson Next Reaction Method and Tau-Leaping Method.
