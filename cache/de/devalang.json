It makes about every mistake possible... the author went on to create a second version to apply the lessons from v1. v2 is a workable scripting language, but like all such attempts, a third version would include even more lessons (ad infinitum)]\r\n\r\nOriginal goal:\r\nThe 'deva' programming language. A small dynamic, language bearing some similarities to C and Python. Designed for embedding in C++ applications, it is also suitable for simple scripting applications.
