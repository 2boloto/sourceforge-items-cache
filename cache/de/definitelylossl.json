The H.264 standard and its implementation in FFMPEG allows for lossless transmission of video data at a smaller file size. \r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\nDEFINITELY LOSSLESS simplifies the manipulation of YUV422 video data embedded in AVI files with UYVY422 Four-CC code. It also checks for truncation and correct reconstruction of the uncompressed video at the receiving side.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nPlease note, that this project is for experts in video processing. If you are not familiar with the above mentioned video formats, this project is probably of no use for you.
