The objective was to have a tool easy to use by people not skilled in financial mathematics techniques and to people without experience in technical questions which influence in the feasibility of the business, for example the fuel efficiency of a power plant. The focus is on projects of power generation with renewables (wind, small hydro, solar, biomass, and biodiesel), nonrenewable fuels (natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear) and transmission lines and distribution substations. People enjoyed it and I applied regular courses for hundreds of experts from power utilities, oil and gas companies and investors mainly in the renewable energy business field. The tool enable to do from \u201ceasy\u201d things like calculating the cost of the energy produced in a power plant up to complex analysis involving trends scenarios and the prioritization of groups of investment projects of different natures.", "shortname": "decidix", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Software to do feasibility studies of electric power projects", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1059927}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/decidix/", "video_url": ""}
