Complexity of cellular systems is highlighted with the multi-layered regulatory mechanisms involving the interactions between bio-molecules (such as DNA, RNA, mi-RNA and proteins). These interactions are analyzed in the form of static networks. Likewise, number of experimental techniques like microarray, RNASeq allows quantification of cellular dynamics and aid in discerning differential gene expression across diverse conditions. Computational biology is in need of methods for integration of static networks and gene expression data, since it provides interesting insights into the dynamics of biological systems.
