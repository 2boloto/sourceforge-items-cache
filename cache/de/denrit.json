SSH is used to  allow remote clients to access the machine and manage any anonymous network that is installed there, plus allows penetration testing anonymously (or non-anonymously) using tools such as Metasploit Framework, nmap, nikto, among others. The list of supported applications will grow as the project progresses. Until now, this project is under development and is very unstable (and some features aren't included). But I've been developing constantly and I think that soon this software will become stable and very useful to pentesters, hackers and researchers (I hope so!)\r\nWell, you can see  the wiki page and the presentation exposed in the download section if you want more information about this project.", "shortname": "denrit", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Perform anonymous and non-anonymous pentesting.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Denrit Source Code", "mount_point": "trunk", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 675799}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/denrit/", "video_url": ""}
