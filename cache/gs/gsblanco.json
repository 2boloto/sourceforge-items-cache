To make a long story short, I had an HDD where I installed all of my programs (a separate drive than the OS itself). This drive had died. There were a lot of programs that just would not uninstall using the fancy \"Add or Remove Programs\" utility that Windows has. In some cases where the application in question was successfully uninstalled, it could not be reinstalled. Visual Studio for example, kept telling me \"Invalid Drive\" whenever I attempted to reinstall it.\r\n", "shortname": "gsblanco", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Windows Uninstaller", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1075497}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/gsblanco/", "video_url": ""}
