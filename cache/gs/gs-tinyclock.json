The application background transparency can be changed and the screen position and level can be locked.\r\n\r\nMore information about the current weather can be found by hovering over the weather image.  Additionally high and low temperatures can be found by hovering over the displayed temperature.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1 Notes:\r\nFixes a definition error that lists August and July as month 7.  I didn't notice this in July and just got round to fixing it.\r\n\r\nKnown Issue - \r\nThe application will crash if it tries to update the weather without an internet connection.  I will resolve this as soon as I have time.\r\n\r\nCredits - \r\nThe application icon was created by xiao4 at deviantART. (http://xiao4.deviantart.com/)\r\n\r\nThe current weather icons were created by LavAna at deviantART. (http://lavana.deviantart.com/)\r\n\r\n**Please rate and review my project.
