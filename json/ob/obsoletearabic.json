The threshold is defined like this. All the lemmas in Buckwalter queried in three news web sites (al-Jazeera, Arabic BBC and Arabic Wikipedia) and if the lemma is not found in any of the three search engines, it is considered as obsolete. Then all the lemmas are queried in the Arabic Gigaword corpus (fourth edition) and if a lemma has a frequency of 10 or less occurrences, then it is considered as obsolete. \r\nReference\r\nMohammed Attia, Pavel Pecina, Lamia Tounsi, Antonio Toral, Josef van Genabith. 2011.
