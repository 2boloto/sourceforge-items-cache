As a practical joke on a programmer, if you remotely activate this on your favorite developer's system (I will create a distribution program later), on a system the developer 'thinks' they own and control it will drive them insane when their system will slow to an absolute crawl based on intervals you've set. I find renaming the process to something ultra non intuitive such as 'lcass' and 'mlasst' - to make them 'seem' like system processes - to be among the most effective names - nothign malicious, right, just having fun.\r\n\r\nNow if you're targeting a superstitious developer. I personally find it particularly effective making comments like 'Boy, I wonder if you have a ghost in your system'.\r\n\r\nOh the FUN one can have with this....", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "qzanticsslugforwindows", "_id": "5464175704161f67401a128a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2361960, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}], "summary": "QZAntics Slug For Windows is a program which slows down all processes", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
