The layout description is available under \"docs\". We also added and updated some of the protocol plugins with publicly available information. The code needs to be programmed to an Arduino Mega. Additionally an RF receiver/transmitter module needs to be used. Wiring details are available under \"docs\". A list of supported RF devices is also available under \"docs\".\r\n\r\nCurrently there are no third party home automation programs that support this solution but we hope that support will be added to some very soon.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rflink", "_id": "5503e422f1fd8d445bdf449a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2425982, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Nodo RadioFrequencyLink aka RFLink", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
