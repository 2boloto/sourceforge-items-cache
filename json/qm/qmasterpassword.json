Access all your passwords using only a single master password. But in contrast to other managers it does not store any passwords: Unique passwords are generated from the master password and a site name. This means you automatically get different passwords for each account and there is no password file that can be lost or get stolen. There is also no need to trust any online password service.\r\n\r\nThere is other compatible software for various platforms, like Android or iOS:\r\nhttp://masterpasswordapp.com\r\nThis page also describes the used algorithm in more detail.\r\n\r\nSee also http://masterpasswordapp.com/what.html to get more familiar with the concept and reasons why to use it.\r\n\r\nqMasterPassword is developed on Linux and also tested on Windows.
