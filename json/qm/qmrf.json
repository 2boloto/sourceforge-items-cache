This implies both a need to be able to identify relevant QSARs and to use them to derive estimates and/or have access to their precalculated estimates. To help meet these needs, the JRC QSAR Model Database is established and freely accessible through http://qsardb.jrc.it. \r\n\r\nThe QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) is a harmonised template for summarising and reporting key information on QSAR models, including the results of any validation studies. The information is structured according to the OECD validation principles.\r\n\r\nDownload the QMRF Editor  http://tinyurl.com/qmrfeditor  in order to describe your models in QMRF format and send the descriptions to JRC-IHCP-COMPUTOX@ec.europa.eu to have them included in the database. \r\n\r\nMore at http://qmrf.sf.net", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "qmrf", "_id": "4f436a520594ca3e4d00083e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 703205, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "(Q)SAR Model Reporting Format Inventory", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Molecular Science", "shortname": "molecular_science", "fullname": "Molecular Science", "id": 609}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Chemistry", "shortname": "chemistry", "fullname": "Chemistry", "id": 384}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Knowledge Management", "shortname": "knowledgemanagement", "fullname": "Knowledge Management", "id": 827}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "shortname": "lgplv3", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 3.0 (LGPLv3)", "id": 680}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Sybase", "shortname": "db_net_sybase", "fullname": "Sybase", "id": 529}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Healthcare Industry", "shortname": "healthcareindustry", "fullname": "Healthcare Industry", "id": 362}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
