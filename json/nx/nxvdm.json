This project aimed at building a virtual dos machine for 64-bit Windows. \r\n\r\nThe idea of this project is to emulate a 16-bit CPU and provide BIOS/DOS interrupt services to MS-DOS applications. In NTVDM64, 16-bit applications runs as before in 32-bit Windows. We want to create a compatible environment for 16-bit applications, for example, applications can access disk files on host machine using legacy DOS interrupts instead of using network sharing.\r\n\r\nNow we already have a PC emulator which could run in Win32 console and it supports all 8086 instructions - MS-DOS 6.22 runs well inside this PC emulator. The only work left for this project is to  combine the emulator with Windows Shell.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the homepage for NXVM and NKVDM at https://github.com/cshaxu/. Here you can find all the demo/manuals about it.", "shortname": "nxvdm", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A virtual DOS machine for x64 Windows which works like ntvdm", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1727787}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/nxvdm/", "video_url": null}
