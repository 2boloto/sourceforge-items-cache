The API supports different file format such as BMP, GIF, JPG, JPEG and PNG. It works with all versions of (Linux) Squid.\r\n\r\nPurpose: Stop Porn & Nudity Images at your Squid level before users can access them.\r\n\r\nHow: Once installed on your Squid server, URLs of image files under a certain size (Max Image Resolution settings) found in web pages requested by users will analyzed and scored by our cloud servers before they reach out users. Depending on your settings (MaxScore) image file will be blocked by your Squid and users won\u2019t be able to see it. Image scoring is made by an advanced algorithm that tries to identify any possible nudity content in each submitted image. The cloud server that delivers the score is really fast and doesn\u2019t slow down your web traffic.\r\n\r\nAdvanced: If you need to have a local version of this API please contact us at support@unveiltech.com.", "shortname": "nudityimagesfilterforsquid", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "https://twitter.com/unveiltech", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/MyUnveilTechnology", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Image Nudity Filter for Squid", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2310130}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/nudityimagesfilterforsquid/", "video_url": null}
