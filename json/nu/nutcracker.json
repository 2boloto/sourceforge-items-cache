Spirals, meteors, butterfly wing and many other effects are available, For each effect you modify the effects parameters.\r\n3) Nutcracker now builds an animated gif of your rgb device with the effect attached. If you dont like the  effect, go back to step 2 and modify and try again\r\n4) Finally, you click on the sequencer you want Nutcracker to create for.
