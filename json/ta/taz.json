The \"temporary autonomous zone\" refers to the ability of TAZ (and slitaz) to always run entirely from RAM. TAZ/slitaz will first always load the source data from CD, HDD or USB stick into the RAM.\r\n\r\nLike slitaz, it makes use of openbox, and the tazpkg package manager.\r\n\r\nIt differs from slitaz however in that it is much more stripped-down, containing only the most essential parts. Additional programs will be installed (on HDD, or USB stick) using the LES scripts and its additional files which can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxefficiencyscripts/files/ It is btw possible to put the scripts and files on the CD, HDD or USB stick, by just copying in the files after having made a bootable media, using the TAZ iso\r\n\r\nOther main differences from slitaz will be the use of mdev (instead of udev, used by slitaz), the ability to boot using xvesa directly from the boot menu, no many-in-1-flavor iso's, ...", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "taz", "_id": "554a20f4d46bb44e196a556e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2457856, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "A fork of the slitaz linux distribution", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: OS distribution", "shortname": "osdistro", "fullname": "OS distribution", "id": 798}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
