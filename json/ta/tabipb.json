The solver employs a well-conditioned boundary integral formulation for the electrostatic potential and its normal derivative on the molecular surface, which is triangulated and the integral equations are discretized by centroid collocation. The linear system is solved by GMRES iteration and the matrix-vector product is carried out by a Cartesian terraced which reduces the cost from O(N^2) to O(N*logN), where N is the number elements.\r\n \r\nREFERENCE: W.H.
