We are creating a software tool and website in spirit of reverse engineering.\r\nWe are currently developing a tool that allows users to creatively convert the real-world manufactured PCB in to their respective Schematic diagrams and documenting their prototypes. Share the schematics, tinker with it to promote the electronics knowledge among interested persons.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\na) User Friendly interface for quick referencing and converting.\r\nb) Schematic View - Shows the circuit which has been converted from real world to virtual world\r\nc) PCB View - Lets you design and export the necessary documents for producing a Printed Circuit Board.\r\nd) Palette Windows - provide parts, tools and information.\r\ne) The Part Creator - a tool to modify parts or create new parts.\r\nf) Inbuilt electronic parts database.\r\nh) Quick prototyping of printed circuit boards.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "reversem", "_id": "50cc479a7929e528731ef9db", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1182369, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "A specialized innovative cross-platform for reverse engineering PCB's ", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Electronic Design Automation (EDA)", "shortname": "eda", "fullname": "Electronic Design Automation (EDA)", "id": 246}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Visual Basic .NET", "shortname": "vb_net", "fullname": "Visual Basic .NET", "id": 453}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Java Swing", "shortname": "ui_swing", "fullname": "Java Swing", "id": 471}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Automotive", "shortname": "automotive", "fullname": "Automotive", "id": 768}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
