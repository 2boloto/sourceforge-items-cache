The kanji lists are taken from the textbook Nakama 2.\r\n\r\nIn this game, you must click on the appropriate kanji according to the pronunciation given to you. When a correct click is made, a sound plays and the kanji disappears. The goal is to make all the kanji disappear as fast as you can.\r\n\r\nYou can compete against yourself, classmates, or friends using a local leaderboard that shows how fast you've completed each level. You can also unlock achievement trophies that record various milestones from your Super Kanji Time II experiences.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "superkanjitime2", "_id": "53560ac824b0d97811696c16", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2202087, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "A time attack game for learning various kanji.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "id": 80}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Vista", "shortname": "vista", "fullname": "Vista", "id": 657}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "id": 906}]}}
