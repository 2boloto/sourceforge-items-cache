The project built using Java programming language. It`s simple interface built using Swing technology. A smart algorithm has been designed to solve your problem. First, using the systematic human way of solving. If the human failed to solve, your problem will be passed to a stronger algorithm that based on Try and Fail techniques and possibilities.
