Its name comes from the term \u201cSu Stori\u201d, which in Sardinian language means \u201cThe Falcon\u201d. It\u2019s version is experimental, but demonstrates a number of interesting features, that can be readily exploited to detect and act against web attacks. SuStorID can be coupled with modsecurity, the well known web application firewall, to gather training data and provide for real-time counteractions. So, SuStorID is a host-based Intrusion Detection System, and by means of modsecurity can access internal web server\u2019s data (i.e. http request/response fields) exactly as Apache does.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "sustorid", "_id": "516c52d2e88f3d0ab9739a4d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 661884, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet", "shortname": "internet", "fullname": "Internet", "id": 87}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Formats and Protocols :: Protocols :: Web Services", "shortname": "webservices", "fullname": "Web Services", "id": 647}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Security Professionals", "shortname": "secpros", "fullname": "Security Professionals", "id": 866}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Security", "shortname": "secindustry", "fullname": "Security", "id": 867}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
