The QP family consists of QP/C, QP/C++, and QP-nano frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, superbly documented, and commercially licensable.\r\n \r\nThe behavior of active objects is specified in QP by means of hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts). The frameworks support manual coding of UML state machines in C or C++ as well as automatic code generation by means of the free QM modeling tool.\r\n\r\nAll QP frameworks can run on bare-metal MCUs, completely replacing a traditional RTOS. Ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for all major CPUs, such as ARM Cortex-M, ARM7/9, MSP430, C28x, C55x, RX, R8C, AVR32, AVRMega, PIC24/dsPIC, as well as Arduino and mbed. QP/C and QP/C++ can also work with a traditional OS/RTOS, such as: POSIX (Linux, QNX), Windows, VxWorks, ThreadX, and uC/OS.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "qpc", "_id": "5022bd1d71b75b7a32b96a53", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 190182, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "bugs", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bugs"}, {"mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets", "label": "Features"}, {"mount_point": "news", "name": "blog", "label": "News"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Forum"}, {"mount_point": "qpcpp", "name": "git", "label": "GIT:QP/C++"}, {"mount_point": "qpn", "name": "git", "label": "GIT:QP-nano"}, {"mount_point": "qtools", "name": "git", "label": "GIT:Qtools"}, {"mount_point": "qpc", "name": "git", "label": "Git:QP/C"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "Event-driven, RTOS-like, active object frameworks for microcontrollers", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 6 - Mature", "shortname": "mature", "fullname": "6 - Mature", "id": 12}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "id": 606}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Design :: UML", "shortname": "uml", "fullname": "UML", "id": 643}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Embedded systems", "shortname": "embedded", "fullname": "Embedded systems", "id": 749}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Other License", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other License", "id": 196}, {"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Aerospace", "shortname": "aerospace", "fullname": "Aerospace", "id": 599}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Healthcare Industry", "shortname": "healthcareindustry", "fullname": "Healthcare Industry", "id": 362}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Telecommunications Industry", "shortname": "telecommunications", "fullname": "Telecommunications Industry", "id": 368}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Automotive", "shortname": "automotive", "fullname": "Automotive", "id": 768}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: Project is an Operating System Kernel", "shortname": "os_projectkernel", "fullname": "Project is an Operating System Kernel", "id": 437}]}}
