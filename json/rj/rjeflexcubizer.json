RJE is a batch file format commonly used to exchange messages between Alliance Access and back-office applications. It's a very old file format, not fancy XML.\r\n\r\nFlexCube (developed by Oracle: www.oracle.com/us/industries/financial-services) is one of the world's top core banking systems and as such has an Alliance Access compatible batch file interface. Unfortunately the implementation of this interface is lacking in some versions:\r\n\r\n1. It cannot handle batch files containing multiple messages.\r\n\r\n2. It does not correctly handle a FIN ACK message paired with a FIN Output message (it treats the pair as single FIN ACK messages, basically ignoring the FIN Output message).\r\n\r\nThis utility aims to solve the above problems by acting as a converter/preprocessor for FlexCube.\r\n\r\nOther back-office applications might also find this useful.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rjeflexcubizer", "_id": "5037b306b9363c6ea242471d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 868216, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Convert Alliance Access RJE files to FlexCube compatible format", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Financial", "shortname": "financial", "fullname": "Financial", "id": 75}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Console/Terminal", "shortname": "ui_consoleterm", "fullname": "Console/Terminal", "id": 460}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
