One of the most interesting things that I learned was that this tool doesn't just track your finances, it also indirectly tracks your life.  There are very few activities that you do which don't cost a single penny.  As a result, I've added a few fields to record some additional information such as journals or people in attendance for an expense.  Feel free to use or disregard these features as you see fit.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to try it out is to use the demo account (password demo) that gets automatically setup on install.  Enjoy!\r\n\r\n(See Wiki for more info)", "shortname": "personalfinan", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Personal budgeting software with projections based on past trends.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 647543}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/personalfinan/", "video_url": null}
