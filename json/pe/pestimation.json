This fact can be partially attributed to their widespread use and applicability. However this increase also suggests that there are several issues that remain to be addressed satisfactorily. One such issue is the diversity and the number of solutions available to the decision maker. Even for algorithms very well suited for a particular problem, it is difficult - mainly due to the computational cost - to use a population large enough to ensure the likelihood of obtaining a solution close to the DMs preferences. In this work we present a novel methodology that produces additional Pareto optimal solutions from a Pareto optimal set obtained at the end run of any multi-objective optimization algorithm. This method, which we refer to as Pareto estimation, is tested against a set of 2 and 3-objective test problems and a 3-objective portfolio optimization problem to illustrate its' utility for a real-world problem.", "shortname": "pestimation", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1094642}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pestimation/", "video_url": ""}
