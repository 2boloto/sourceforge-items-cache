Techniques which distinguish active regulatory elements by virtue of this include micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin (MNAse-seq), which preferentially depletes DNA which is not tightly bound by proteins, and formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq), which enriches for sequences which are nucleosome-depleted.  These techniques are especially advantageous due to their limited requirements for reagents, and advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have made them increasingly useful for assessment and identification of novel regulatory elements.  However, a variety of experimental and sequencing-induced biases can preclude robust detection of novel regulatory elements: variations in copy number and somy, errors in sequencing and alignment, and biases introduced by nuclease", "shortname": "peaksandvalleys", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Peaks and Valley detection using NGS data", "tools": [{"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2297426}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/peaksandvalleys/", "video_url": null}
