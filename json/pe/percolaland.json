Much of the progress in spatial patterns and structure changes understanding have supported in percolation theory. Percolation theory aims to evaluate how connectivity is broken into spatially structured systems or quantifies the connectivity structure. Connectivity in this case refers spatial continuity of arrangements habitat areas.\r\nThere are not a currently tools available to calculate percolation indices in landscapes files ascii.txt. Nevertheless there is a scarcity of software that perform quickly and easily tasks such what could be employed both in the classroom by teachers and students and having the output data manipulation easily (ascii.txt). The main goal to develop the PercolaLand software is a solve this gap in Landscape Ecology literature.
