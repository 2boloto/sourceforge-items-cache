Further instructions can be found in the file microcode.tar.bz2.  The MATLAB codes are used for visualization, evaluating analytical bounds and estimates as well as in the generation of digital and particulate microstructures.  The Fortran codes are based on the finite element method in linear and nonlinear settings, the latter capable of finite deformations with damage.  The underlying theory is outlined in the lecture notes.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\u0130lker Temizer\r\n\r\nAssistant Professor\r\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering\r\nBilkent University\r\n06800 Bilkent, Ankara\r\nTurkey", "shortname": "multiscale", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A collection of lecture notes and accompanying code on micromechanics", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 836941}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/multiscale/", "video_url": ""}
