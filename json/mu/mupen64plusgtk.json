It is a graphical program that helps you configure Mupen64Plus and select your games.

I originally wrote this for myself to replace the front-end that used to come from the Ubuntu/Debian releases of Mupen64Plus that is no longer available, and after getting it relatively usable, I decided to upload it here so others may benefit.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still working on the project I recorded a video demonstration which you can watch at: http://youtu.be/NCiRcgnBT58", "shortname": "mupen64plusgtk", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "gerowin", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "http://www.facebook.com/marcusdean.adams", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Graphical Launcher for Mupen64Plus", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1984602}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mupen64plusgtk/", "video_url": ""}
