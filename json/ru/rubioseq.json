We present RUbioSeq+, a stand-alone and multiplatform application for the integrated analysis of NGS data. More specifically, our software implements pipelines for the analysis of single nucleotide and copy-number variation, bisulfite-seq and ChIP-seq experiments using well-established tools to perform these common tasks. RUbioSeq+ is free and includes all the core functionalities implemented in the original release of RUbioSeq (v3.2.1) but, also, outperforms and expands RUbioSeq capabilities supporting the parallelized analysis of full genomes in computing farms. RUbioSeq+ also incorporates a new GUI designed for interdisciplinary research groups where bioinformaticians and biomedical researchers work together.
