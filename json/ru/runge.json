It solves initial value problem (aka Cauchy problem). Few advantages Runge provides:\r\n\r\n    It's fast. It utilizes BLAS and LAPACK libraries optimized for modern multi-core processors.\r\n    It's interactive. It allows you to start a solution by mouse click on a plane.\r\n    It's precise. It uses Runge Rule to adjust step length to satisfy required precision on each step.\r\n    It's effective. When it needs to compute derivatives (Jacobian matrix, for example) it does that analytically, i.e. without using numerical methods.\r\n    It's portable. It works on Windows and Linux 32 and 64 bit and Mac OS X 64 bit.\r\n    It's open. It allows you to implement and embed your own algorithms (aka \"solvers\").\r\n    It's easy to use. It allows to export results to MS Excel and MATLAB.\r\n    It's multilingual. It currently supports Englis and Russian languages.\r\n    It's free. It's distributed under the Boost Software License.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "runge", "_id": "505a5afc0594ca1b0fd002ca", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 957741, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Runge is an Interactive Solver for Systems of Differential Equations", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization", "shortname": "visualization", "fullname": "Visualization", "id": 135}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics", "shortname": "mathematics", "fullname": "Mathematics", "id": 98}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Physics", "shortname": "physics", "fullname": "Physics", "id": 387}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Fortran", "shortname": "fortran", "fullname": "Fortran", "id": 169}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Boost Software License (BSL1.0)", "shortname": "boostlicense", "fullname": "Boost Software License (BSL1.0)", "id": 678}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "fullname": "Qt", "id": 479}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: Russian", "shortname": "russian", "fullname": "Russian", "id": 295}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "id": 219}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
