So far it works in Linux, Mac OS and Windows.\r\n\r\nThe notes are stored as plain text files and are synced with ownCloud's file sync functionality. Of course other software, like Dropbox can be used too.\r\n\r\nI like the concept of having notes accessible in plain text files, like it is done in the ownCloud notes app, but I was not able to find a decent desktop note taking tool or a text editor, that handles them well. Out of this need QOwnNotes was born.\r\n\r\nThis application is still under development, so there will be added new features constantly.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the project webpage for downloading QOwnNotes.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "qownnotes", "_id": "548c51573e5e832c53465f78", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2378232, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "QOwnNotes is a ownCloud note editor.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "shortname": "communications", "fullname": "Communications", "id": 20}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Knowledge Management", "shortname": "knowledgemanagement", "fullname": "Knowledge Management", "id": 827}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: SQLite", "shortname": "db_net_sqlite", "fullname": "SQLite", "id": 531}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "fullname": "Qt", "id": 479}], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: OS X", "shortname": "macosx", "fullname": "OS X", "id": 309}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "id": 906}]}}
