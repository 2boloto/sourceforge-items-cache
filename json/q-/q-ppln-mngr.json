It expands the value of your existing job scheduler - either Grid Engine or TORQUE PBS - through numerous functions that help you organize, submit, monitor, manage and share your informatics work. \r\n\r\nData processing pipelines require high-level organization and parallelization of work to optimize resource utilization and decrease the time to results. q (from queue) allows complex job sequences to be efficiently assembled and managed, including dependency tracking, parallelization, and pipeline-level monitoring, error recovery, and data protection. Pipelines are constructed from modular script files, with job definitions and results stored in easily retrieved job files. A web interface facilitates job submission and monitoring, with the complete pipeline exportable for full transparency.
