It uses a proven HTB QOS algorithm. It provides dynamic traffic shaping which is more effective than traditional, static shaping.

At the same time does not allow for creation of congestion, ensuring complete convenience of interactive services. \r\nNiceShaper takes care of download when upload stops up.", "shortname": "niceshaper", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "NiceShaper provides dynamic traffic shaping for Linux router", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 230773}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/niceshaper/", "video_url": ""}
