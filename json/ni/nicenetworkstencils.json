Dia was pretty much the only choice and it has pretty ugly stencils, Flow has come around and uses the same ugly stencils. As of v2.8.1, Flow can now import and use SVG stencils. So I took some nice looking stencils provided by the nice people at OSA and put them together properly so you can instantly unpack and use them in Calligra Flow.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we finally have a great open source diagramming program with sharp looking stencils to make sharp looking professional diagrams!\r\n\r\nVery big thanks to OSA for providing their icon library free under the Creative Commons.
