You don't need to use any xml configuration (like, for example in MyBatis/iBatis). You also don't need to use any annotations to run SQL Mapper. The SQL Mapper is similar to Spring JDBC Framework, but it has some of its features simplified and some changed.\r\nIt runs on JDK 7 or higher.\r\n\r\nThe zip archive contains the library jar, sources and javadocs, and also a demo which shows how to use the mapper.\r\n\r\nP.S.
