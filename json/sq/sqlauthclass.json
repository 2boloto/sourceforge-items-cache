A common characteristic of such in-house developed solutions is that a database is used to hold user information such as user name, password, and additional information such as first and last name, email address, etc.\r\nThe challenge then becomes: How make that user data accessible for a COTS access management solution like NetIQ Access Manager so that users can still authenticate using their current credentials. A transparent migration path from custom to COTS is desirable.\r\nNetIQ Access Manager can use an SQL database as an authentication source with this custom authentication class.   The user is added to an LDAP directory after successful authentication to the SQL database so that Access Manager can have access to the user attributes, password, etc. ", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "sqlauthclass", "_id": "54f70dcfd46bb46b86a65297", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2419973, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "SQL Authentication class for NetIQ Access Manager", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
