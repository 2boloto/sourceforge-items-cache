The Benchmark was built and available with two different scenarios, each scenario has its own characteristics and can be used independently of each other.\r\nBasically each scenario consists of a database Production (BDP) large volume that simulates a real environment and a database of Experiments (BDE) that contains information about SQL, Mutants and results of experiments with random instruction methods. The reference value is nothing more than a set of data bases. The first scenario has the structure and the generated data for the specific benchmark, the second is its structure and data obtained from an actual application.
