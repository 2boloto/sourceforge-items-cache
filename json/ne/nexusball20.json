Which means that, along with great graphic quality, Nexus Ball has the physical effects to cause the ball to roll with perfect simulation. And that's a very detailed note on Nexus Ball, because to make it to the end of each of the 21 levels, Nexus Ball challenges you to overcome many obstacles in this game, and you must take into account the possibilities of where the ball's headed. Because in Nexus Ball not only do you have to dodge obstacles and traps, but you'll also have to deal with more complicated problems that require frenzy and studying of the situation slowly. But all the levels of Nexus Ball are solvable, so don't despair, you just have to find out by getting the ball rolling!", "shortname": "nexusball20", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Nexus Ball is a puzzle and action game, in 3 dimensions, which challen", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2390353}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/nexusball20/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/Ksk-Ri_7Dh4?rel=0"}
