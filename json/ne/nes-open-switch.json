It contains the protocol implementation required to run a networking device in a computer network. NES Open Switch supports various networking media as: Ethernet, SDH/Sonet, OTN and WDM. The supporting protocols for different media are being developed as individual modules in the stack. For example for Ethernet media support protocol modules like STP, CFM and LACP are present in the stack. This stack can be ported on a networking hardware and a fully functional networking device can be built.\r\n\r\nThe NES Open Switch is developed and maintained by an open community of developers. This stack is written completely in C99. The stack can be used on any operating system which supports POSIX 2001 API. The build system is written in Make. The stack is released under the NES RED License, and it is an open-source software.\r\n\r\n[Repository] (https://github.com/nes-repo/NES-Open-Switch)", "shortname": "nes-open-switch", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "nes_open_switch", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/nes.open.switch", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "The 'NES Open Switch' network protocol stack.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 847336}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "link"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/nes-open-switch/", "video_url": null}
