The framework allows a language developer to work with multiple object systems on top of Tcl in a single workspace. The developer can benefit from a rich and extensible set of predefined functions (typically implemented in C) which can be registered for use on objects and classes in a given object system. NSF provides a tool box for defining dynamic, object-oriented, and domain-specific languages.\r\n\r\nNSF ships with 3 fully scripted language definitions, containing XOTcl 2 and the Next Scripting language NX.\r\n\r\nNX is a highly flexible and object-oriented scripting language. It is a descendant of XOTcl and was designed based on 10 years of experience with XOTcl in projects containing several hundred thousand lines of code. While XOTcl was the first language designed to provide language support for design patterns, NX adds language-oriented programming and higher safety.", "shortname": "next-scripting", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": " Next Scripting Framework (NSF)", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 315318}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/next-scripting/", "video_url": ""}
