The output from the first version is only through console. Only two protocols, IP and TCP, was implemented.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the software was enhanced by Nodthapob Reangnapapol and Chaipat Jaruchart to display output on simple scrollable GUI. Two more protocols, Wi-Fi and Ethernet, are implemented. Two more protocols, UTP and infrared, are partially implemented\r\n\r\nIn 2010, the software was enhanced by two teams.\r\n\r\n    The first team, Munthana Limapirak and Sarawut Sukjai, focused on improving user friendliness. The output is now separated by protocol. The tab interface is partially implemented. Three more protocols, ARP, RARP, and UDP, are implemented.\r\n    The seco", "shortname": "netstacksim", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "an extensible network stack simulator", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 722149}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/netstacksim/", "video_url": ""}
