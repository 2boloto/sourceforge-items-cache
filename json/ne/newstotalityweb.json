As I picture it now, it would import news articles and array them in a timeline with authorship, location, and any other relevant metadata. Then, it would format and host this content on a webpage that allows dynamic manipulation of a massive 3d diagram. Users would join and create links between any two items or general commentary with an appropriate attribution of the source of their contention. This would allow the totality of the conflicting narratives of mainstream and conspiracy thinkers to be put in the same place for critical analysis. The goal is to make it as completely transparent as possible, displaying as much information as is practicable. The actual content, with revision numbers and timestamps, could be mirrored to whoever would like a copy. The forensics of each user would be transparent, with all edits listed, etc. All of this without partiality.", "shortname": "newstotalityweb", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "This is software to visualize the totality of an issue(on the web).", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 845670}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/newstotalityweb/", "video_url": ""}
