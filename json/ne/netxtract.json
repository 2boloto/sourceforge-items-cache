It attempts to demonstrate how Wireshark's powerful network traffic analysis capabilities can be combined with the file carving capabilities of programs such as Foremost and NetworkMiner in a manner that is portable and extensible (hence the choice of Perl).  \r\n\r\nHopefully Wireshark project may eventually choose to incorporate some of these features such as automated TCP/UDP session extraction, an interface to a scripting engine such as Python which can be used to add modular units for file carving, and ability to export network activity in easily-readable diagram format.\r\n", "shortname": "netxtract", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 614604}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/netxtract/", "video_url": ""}
