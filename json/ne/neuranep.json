Microthreads are general processing elements that can also represent non-neural elements, such as cell populations, extracellular space, emulating sensory activity, etc.\r\n\r\nNeuraNEP handles microthread scheduling, synchronization, distribution and communication.\r\n\r\nThis project is a fork of SpikeOS (sourceforge.net/projects/spikeos) and represents a major update to that code base, including a scripting interface and low-level rewrite of several components. SpikeOS was oriented towards computational modeling.
