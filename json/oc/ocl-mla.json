One of the primary features of the ocl interface is that it defines a set of logical devices (currently a performance device and an auxiliary device) that are able to run OpenCL C kernels.  Each logical device is created with an associated queue and context, and has a user interface for creating and manipulating data, arguments and timing events.  The current interface is available in C and Fortran.", "shortname": "ocl-mla", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Mid-level abstraction interface to ease OpenCL development", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Git Repository", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 734122}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ocl-mla/", "video_url": ""}
