We propose a novel method for joint optimization of processing, storage, and network resources through a dual decomposition of the global problem to rapidly solve local subproblems towards an eventual global optimum. The prioritization of local convergence allows our method to more readily adapt to network dynamics, such as changing cloud instance prices, than existing distributed optimization methods, with implications for lower cost distributed application workloads.", "shortname": "ocd-code", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Implementation of OCD distributed optimization algorithm", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 742514}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ocd-code/", "video_url": ""}
