This is a way to overcome that hurdle.  the low-level \"octets\" can be distributed among a cluster of computers, organized in a grid.  they don't have to send each other their whole dataset - only a zoomed out image of it.  the further away, the more zoomed out.  thus, i/o traffic is greatly reduced.  combine this with the fact that it's an O(N) algorithm, and what you get is an accurate particle-based physics simulator whose simulation speed scales with the number of particles per compute unit even for VERY large particle counts and VERY large computing arrays.  In a phrase, simulation on a massive scale!", "shortname": "octreemethodforparticles", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "simulation of particles using an oct-tree", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2045559}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/octreemethodforparticles/", "video_url": ""}
