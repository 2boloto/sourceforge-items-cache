Pieces are placed in a random order. Not a single piece in a right place. The objective of the game is to swap the messed up puzzle pieces to restore the primary picture. If you click on an element it will be highlighted with a blue border. Double click on the same element will cause the border to be removed. To make a swap click on the piece you wish to move. Then click again on the square you want to move it to. Positions of the two pieces will be changed. Continue the process until the image is recovered. The faster you finish the puzzle and the fewer moves you make, the higher your score.\r\n\r\nDownload options:\r\n- complete application with all the source code as well as jar and exe files.\r\n- exe file only.\r\nTo run the project use Puzzle.jar or Puzzle.exe.\r\n\r\nSee wiki for a full project description.\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "swappuzzle", "_id": "50f5af2604161f5f06bcb922", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1234397, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Swap messed up puzzle pieces to restore a primary picture.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games", "shortname": "Puzzles", "fullname": "Puzzle Games", "id": 268}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: Polish", "shortname": "polish", "fullname": "Polish", "id": 344}, {"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": []}}
