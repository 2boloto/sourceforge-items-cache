It runs on Linux, Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. The public APIs are available for the device and control point stacks in C++, C#, Java and C. JavaScript APIs are also provided for the control point stack.\r\n\r\nUPnP services are presented as classes with actions appearing as functions and state variables appearing as member variables. These classes are referred to as proxies for users of the control point stack and providers for users of the device stack.\r\n\r\nProxies and Providers are included for all OpenHome and UPnP AV services. If your application uses other services, ohNet includes a tool (ohNetGen) to generate proxies and/or providers from the service XML in any of the supported languages.\r\n\r\nSource code is available under a Simplified BSD license.
