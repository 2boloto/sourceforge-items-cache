The idea is inspired by my father, who is a retired senior engineer with the expertise in the special steel industry. He has an old scientific calculator. The letters on the keyboard can barely be seen. However he just loves that calculator. Unfortunately, that model is no longer manufactured by the manufacturer. Therefore I come with an idea, how about writing a software professional level scientific calculator? It needs to support calculus and other advanced mathematical calculations. That's where the term OldMaster comes from? This project is for old masters like my fathers.", "shortname": "oldmaster", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "OldMaster aims to develop software calculators for old masters", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1056830}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/oldmaster/", "video_url": ""}
