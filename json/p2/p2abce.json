Some features such as revocation or de-anonymization even require the combination of several cryptographic protocols. These differences and the complexity of the cryptographic protocols hinder the deployment of these mechanisms for practical applications and also make it almost impossible to switch the underlying cryptographic algorithms once the application has been designed. In this policy engine, we aim to bridge this gap and simplify the design and deployment of privacy-friendly authentication mechanisms. We unify the different concepts and features and define privacy-preserving attribute-based credentials (Privacy-ABCs) and provide a language framework in XML schema.
