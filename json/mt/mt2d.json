In terms of  unstructured grids, it can deal with arbitrarily complicated models, including the surface topographies.  It allows for  arbitrary distributions of conductivity,  permittivity and permeability.  In addition, it offers two algorithms: the total field approach and the secondary field approach. \r\n\r\nAt present, most of 2D MT modeling codes are developed in terms of Matlab or FORTRAN and there are no open source ones for public. The release of C++ based MT2D is to  offer an accurate 2D MT code for researchers, students in geophysical community. Using this simple and accurate solver, inversion software can be easily developed. \r\n\r\nTo deal with broadband frequencies (MT and RMT problems), a same grid including the air space is used for both TE and TM mode. \r\n\r\nTo whom is interesting in an usage of this code, please send an email to: renzhengyong@gmail.com", "shortname": "mt2d", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "An 2D magnetotellurics finite element solver using unstructured grids", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2219087}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mt2d/", "video_url": null}
