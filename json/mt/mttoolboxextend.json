The metagenomics version of MT-Toolbox is a plugin that includes operations for OTU building, OTU taxonomy assignments, and OTU contaminant filtering.  These features are not included in the basic version because they only apply to microbial 16S profiling experiments.  The standard version of MT-Toolbox can be applied to any amplicon sequencing project where molecule tags are incorporated.  For more information on MT-MT-Toolbox and basic features included in MT-Toolbox please refer to the MT-Toolbox webpage (link below).
