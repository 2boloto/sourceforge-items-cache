Two players control their own ships and fire lasers and lay bombs in an attempt to destroy each other. Controls are weird to work on the Mac, but also work with an XBox controller. Written in C#, I did everything from art to programming to sounds. The design is based on Omega Race with much contribution by Professor Keenan.", "shortname": "omegaracex", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple 2D Versus Game Based on the Omega Race game", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1713815}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/omegaracex/", "video_url": ""}
