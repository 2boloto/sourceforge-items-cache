He/she may assign any symbol of their choice.\r\n\r\nThe domain i.e number of symbols the user may draw / assign is unlimited.\r\n\r\nThis project can be further extended by giving audio output so that even people with low vision / blind can have a better experience using the computer.\r\n\r\nIt may also be extended to support other applications and also maybe made cross platform.\r\n\r\nIt is written in Java using Netbeans 7.3.1", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "symbolcommander", "_id": "529895a785540d6007c83dd7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2024642, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Symbol Commander - Issuing command to the system by drawing symbols.
