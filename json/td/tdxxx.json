The intent is that the code is extensible, giving the user a high level of control over new forces that impact the motions of one or more floating bodies, tethered or untetethered to one another.  All of the linearized wave-hydrodynamics is complete allowing the user to concentrate on adding problem specific behaviors to the system without having to program the relatively complicated wave-body interactions.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tdxxx", "_id": "50c68c81b9363c3cebeb925f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1166897, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Matlab code for simulation of floating body motions in the time domain", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
