A nucleotide assembly-based strategy does not fare much better since metagenomic assemblies are typically very fragmented and also leave a large fraction of reads unassembled. We present a method for reconstructing complete protein sequences directly from NGS metagenomic data. Our framework is based on a novel Short Peptide Assembler (SPA) that assembles protein sequences from their constituent peptide fragments identified on short reads. We also present a new implementation of SPA based on suffix array (SFA-SPA) which runs significantly faster than SPA. \r\n\r\nYoungik Yang, Cuncong Zhong, and Shibu Yooseph*\r\nJ.
