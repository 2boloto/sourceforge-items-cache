If only a few people think it is spam, not that many will be sent.  If the money line is a web site, an attempt will be made to open 10 channels, again like above, if many people think it is spam, it becomes a flood attack and down goes the money site.  If only a few think it spam, the server will handle the requests.  If spam stops working, it will slow down the amount.
