It features customized lightweight desktops (like E19, LXDE and Openbox), multimedia plugins, selected sets of apps and own custom tools to ease different tasks.\r\n\r\nSparky is in-between the distros that are beginner-friendly and those, that require some amount of Linux knowledge. Beginning Linux users are advised to consult the project forums regarding any issues or doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\nSparkyLinux ISO images provide a snapshot of the package tree available at the time of their release (Sparky's repository, as well as Debian's Testing repo). While it is possible to upgrade a running ISO to the latest version via APT, you should be aware that running ISOs are placed in RAM, so large upgrades might fail unexpectedly.\r\nThe common practise is to upgrade the required packages only (the installer for example, if there's an issue with it) and the rest of the system after installing to disk.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "sparkylinux", "_id": "4f18b4a10594ca6797000909", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 672474, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Lightweight & fast Debian-based Linux Distribution", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: OS distribution :: Live CD", "shortname": "livecd", "fullname": "Live CD", "id": 799}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: X Window System (X11)", "shortname": "x11", "fullname": "X Window System (X11)", "id": 229}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
