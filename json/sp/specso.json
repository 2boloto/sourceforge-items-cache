Such separation also allows a unique scheme for multiple inheritance which is resolved at compile time in the behavior domain.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "specso", "_id": "518dca6181b24b5779130c4e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1759181, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "A programming language based on behavior-specification using rules", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
