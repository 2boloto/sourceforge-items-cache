A simple \"spanning class\" enhancement to core Java allows you to insert a class or interface that acts as super to one or more existing classes without changing them. The consistency, and utility of this feature has been studied over several years. Results and explanation is available in several peer-reviewed research papers already published.\r\n\r\nThis project is an opportunity for researchers and students to work on a project. Either theory, design, or code-and-test can be contributed.
