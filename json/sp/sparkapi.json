This is encapsulated in the SparkAPI project which contains all the classes and helper functions required to easily utilise the API. A set of sample applications demonstrating some simple uses of the API are also available.\r\n\r\nThe component also supports replay from historical files and does not require a connection to the Spark servers when working in file replay mode. This makes it ideal for those wishing to learn how to manipulate and utilise institutional-grade market data in non-institutional setting.\r\n\r\nABOUT SPARK\r\nSpark is a market data provider that supplies real-time exchange grade data feeds for Australian and New Zealand equity and options markets", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "sparkapi", "_id": "50eaa14c1be1ce2109e74439", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1215584, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "C# library and samples for processing market data from the Spark API", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Office/Business :: Financial :: Investment", "shortname": "investment", "fullname": "Investment", "id": 77}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C#", "shortname": "csharp", "fullname": "C#", "id": 271}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "id": 16}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Financial and Insurance Industry", "shortname": "financialinsurance", "fullname": "Financial and Insurance Industry", "id": 361}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
