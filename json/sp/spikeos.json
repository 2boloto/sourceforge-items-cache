Each microthread is conceptually similar to a task in Ada and it is much lighter weight than an operating system thread. SpikeOS was designed to handle millions of microthreads, for example in a neural network hosting millions of spiking model neurons. \r\n\r\nSpikeOS handles microthread scheduling, synchronization, distribution and communication.\r\n\r\n*** This project has been forked. NeuraNEP (sourceforge.net/projects/neuranep) represents a major update to SpikeOS. It has the same core functionality plus several enhancements, including a scripting interface. NeuraNEP is engineering-oriented, as opposed to simulation-oriented, and some features/capabilities have changed.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "spikeos", "_id": "516d83665fcbc9797ba3f8de", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 511206, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "id": 606}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Simulations", "shortname": "simulations", "fullname": "Simulations", "id": 600}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
