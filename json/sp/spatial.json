Spatial is a general purpose library with good overall performance thanks to its self-balancing k-d tree containers. Spatial makes it easy to search for nearest neighbors, orthogonal\r\nranges, or perform ordering of objects in any number of dimensions.\r\n\r\nSpatial's design borrows heavily from the STL, and strives to follow it's elegant interface; therefore Spatial's containers, iterators and functionals integrate well with the STL. Additionally, Spatial's self-balancing kd-tree based containers, capable of object insertion and removal in fractional amortized time, prevent worst-case computational time on most operations.\r\n\r\nSpatial was created with tracking analysis and real-time positioning in mind, but its good overall performance and its set of algorithms should make it as simple for anyone to do spatial analysis in their application.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "spatial", "_id": "5144437234309d2ea3b3ca0a", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 510006, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}, {"mount_point": "feature-requests", "name": "tickets", "label": "Feature Requests"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Bug Report"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Library of generic, k-d tree multi-dimensional containers", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Boost Software License (BSL1.0)", "shortname": "boostlicense", "fullname": "Boost Software License (BSL1.0)", "id": 678}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "All BSD Platforms (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD/Apple Mac OS X)", "id": 202}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 64-bit MS Windows", "shortname": "win64", "fullname": "64-bit MS Windows", "id": 655}]}}
