The games have ranged from fps' like COD, puzzle games such as BrainAge, and 3d racing games. The problem is that while youth have access and also find these type of games entertaining, there are numerous groups that do not find videogames as enticing, and are hence reluctant to play... \r\n\r\nBut what if we avoid these shortcomings in the development of a game that does cognitive training in a much more clever way? The motivation for Space Induction is thus.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nCollect rods (blue cylinders placed on the walls) in a maze setting. Place a total 4 rods in generator in order to turn on all lights and complete the level. Memorize the map for a perfect run. Collect and place all 4 rods in each level before your energy (green bar) drains to 0, and your power runs out.\r\n\r\nControls\r\n\r\nDirectional Keys - movement\r\nSpace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "spaceinduction", "_id": "5204f78081b24b2c6334b9a5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1928173, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}], "summary": "Game designed for seniors for U of T", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
