It is conceived as a kind of pool of active knowledge in the area of telecommunication processes that can be modeled by MAP, INAP and CAP. This Project supports two modes of operation â€“ simulation mode to develop and tests scenarios, and network mode to execute scenarios against the network. Communication with the network use a light version of SCTP and M2PA.\r\nThe project is completed to the stage of recognising Application Contexts and Operations for MAPv1/2/3, CAP1/2/3/4 and Ericsson CS1+. Therefore, any scenario can be developed. ISUP is not developed although is it the easiest of all. See the roadmap to get informed about the status and plans.\r\nThe 7-Scales is written in C under Linux. It requires some C-development skills and considerable knowledge in the area of SS7 Application Parts, namelly MAP, INAP and CAP.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "the7scales", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/iatanasov/", "username": "iatanasov", "name": "Ivelin Atanasov"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.7-scales.free.bg/The7-Scales/"}
