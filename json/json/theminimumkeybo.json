It is easy. This Project is also an educational one.\r\n\r\nFor example: sloppy typing.\r\nJust think what this means: the user presses a Little bit to the left or right, which means: the Position and value pairs of \"en_hashes\" must be adjusted +- 1. Thats all.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for missing words: just Import another book (basically any ASCII file, or Import your mail conversations).\r\n\r\nOr let the database learn from user Inputs. Just update the \"en_context\" score after the user selects a word.\r\n\r\nThose examples Show you how easy it is :-)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "theminimumkeybo", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kadrim1983/", "username": "kadrim1983", "name": "tyrael.homeip.net"}], "external_homepage": "http://tyrael.homeip.net/minimum_keyboard/"}
