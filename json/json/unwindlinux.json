Elmore founded the project as a hobby when he was 16, to find out more about computer programming, and was disappointed with the current \"out-of-the-box\" Linux distros as he would call them (such as Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, etc.). It was founded in 2012 out of Indianapolis, Indiana, US. Unwind is an Arch Linux-based distro aimed at working right out-of-the-box, basically saying \"relax, let us handle the drivers, firmware, updates and such\". The project aims at a new version every half a year (6 months), unless a critical update is needed. While the project aims at working without any configuration needed, the project uses minimal proprietary and third-party drivers and software.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "unwindlinux", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/unwindlinux/", "username": "unwindlinux", "name": "Shane Elmore"}], "external_homepage": "http://unwindlinux.org"}
