We used this module internally for the development\r\nof our project. Later on as this tool helped us a lot to ?gure out several bugs\r\ninside our code- work, we thought that it is worth a mention.This tool is built\r\nupon GTK+ and Graphviz. GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) is a cross-platform widget toolkit\r\nfor creating graphical user interfaces. (ref: Wikipedia) It is also the\r\nfundamental user interface toolkit of object model environment for most of the\r\n*nix operating systems. Graphviz (short for Graph Visualization Software) is a\r\npackage of open-source tools initiated by AT&T Labs Research for drawing graphs\r\nspeci?ed in DOT language scripts. (ref: Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nThis editor could be a full-blown integrated development environment to work\r\nwith com- plex graphs, thus there is a large scope for its continued\r\ndevelopment. A lot of visual elements could still be picked up from the DOT\r\nlan", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "undirectedgraph", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/shrekster/", "username": "shrekster", "name": "Shikhar Mall"}], "external_homepage": null}
