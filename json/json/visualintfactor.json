This grid is based on pascals triangle, which is a 1d cellular automata that calculates (X choose Y) factorials by each cell being the sum of the 2 cells upleft and upright. Draw a binary integer from a cell going upright, then explore the allowed transforms which may lead you to a factored state in 2 dimensions, from the lowest digit of the 2 odd integers both upright and upleft, its factors, and in the 2d space they are rectangle edges of, those pixels/digitbits must be on when there is an on bit somewhere downleft and downright after crossing empty cells, but if it finds either whole diagonal row empty then it must also be empty/zerodigit. The 2 main rules are: Any 2 cells below may both turn off and turn on the one above, or the reverse, and any on cell may move horizontally to an empty cell.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "visualintfactor", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/benrayfield/", "username": "benrayfield", "name": "BenRayfield"}], "external_homepage": "http://visualinteger.com"}
