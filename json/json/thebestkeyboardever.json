It allows the user to:\r\n- Have an exact same layout of the on-screen keyboard as your physical keyboard\r\n- Allows the use of Ctrl, Function, Windows and other keys\r\n- Create custom shortcuts and store then as keys\r\n- Create new key layouts\r\n- Use swipe functionality\r\n- Use custom dictionaries\r\n\r\nBest of all its FREE and Open Source.
