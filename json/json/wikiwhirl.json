So far, wiki refactoring is a manual, time-consuming and error-prone activity. We strive to ease wiki refactoring by using mind maps as a graphical representation of the wiki structure, and mind map manipulations as a way to express refactoring. This work(1) de\u001cfines the semantics of common refactoring operations based on Wikipedia best practices, (2) advocates using mind maps to engage end users in refactoring, and (3) introduces a DSL built on top of FreeMind, a mind mapping tool. Thus, wikis are depicted as FreeMind maps, and the interactions with its GUI are interpreted as refactoring operations. Hence, the use of a DSL is based not only on reliability grounds but also on facilitating end-user participation, a wiki hallmark.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wikiwhirl", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/gorkapuente/", "username": "gorkapuente", "name": "Gorka Puente"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.onekin.org/wikiwhirl"}
