Main features are project management, extensive code browsing, syntax highlighting / command expansion, and a command REPL (Read/Eval/Print Loop). Directories with .vfs extension are threated as Projects and can be deployed as starkits or starpacks. Procedures, classes, namespace definitions etc. can be send to the REPL or to another interpreter for agile and dynamic development. Even the Tclhttpd web server can be started inside the REPL and .tml files are supported to a certain grade.\r\nThe project was inspired by Eclipse and Lisp/SLIME.\r\n\r\nTloona is deployed as a starkit and works with ActiveTcl 8.5 or Tclkit 8.5, on Windows and Mac OSX out of the box. It should also work on Linux with a decent ActiveTcl 8.5 installation, but binary dependencies are not included in the starkit (due to the fact that the author is not in the mood to test another platform).
