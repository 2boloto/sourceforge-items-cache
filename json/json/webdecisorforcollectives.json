New technologies offer the ability to improve this, but how?\r\nThe ideal tool would let every user adds their opinions and proposals. It would order all of them in a frame easy to follow. It wouldn't need any moderator. And finally, the ideal tool would be very easy to use. With all those objectives this web tool has been designed. It is very similar to a forum. The differences are: the system distinguishes between opinions and proposals, each proposal can be voted and shows a voting box, the proposals are ordered in a folder-like frame maintained by the users themselves, opinions are in a pull-down panel under every proposal.\r\nWith these features, whatever debate can be express by means of this tool.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "webdecisorforcollectives", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kainum/", "username": "kainum", "name": "DIEGO A LOPEZ GARCIA"}], "external_homepage": "http://webdecisorforcollectives.sourceforge.net"}
