One of the most tedious standards is pre-sorting every address according to Area Distribution Centers (ADC) which becomes even more tedious when working with \"Flats\" as defined by the post office. I work for a non-profit who used to manually sort through every address manually. So I designed a program for them that would speed up the process considerably.
