Of course, I didn't want to double up the workload and thus, found a PERFECT solution in AsciiDoc & BlogPost. To ease the deployment/generation of homepage, pdf and latex files I wrote a little Makefile who takes care of the entire magic by providing the targets 'pdf', 'hp' and 'latex'. In combination with the Foghorn theme for Wordpress and less than 10 plugins, it's easy to setup a pretty awesome homepage as well as automated pdf generation based on asciidoc files only.\r\nAs a \"Show Case\" I prepared the following homepage by splitting up the asciidoc userguide.txt.\r\nhttp://asciidoc.the-huck.com/ \r\nOne thing which currently doesn't quite show up in the homepage is the Section Index which would provide links to level 3 headers in the current page. With your own asciidoc documents, however, the section index should show up and can be quite useful in long pages.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wp-pdf", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/tschaume/", "username": "tschaume", "name": "Patrick Huck"}], "external_homepage": "http://asciidoc.the-huck.com"}
