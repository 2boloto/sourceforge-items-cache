Robot runs on and automates all major systems such as Windows, Linux and Unix, plus mobile platforms, such as IOS and Android.\r\nThe product has the same functionality, look and feel regardless of OS, and your scripts are completely transferable between platforms.\r\n\r\nUtilising remote desktop technologies, such as RFB (VNC), together with image based testing principles, T-Plan Robot provides a human-like approach to software testing from the end-user GUI perspective.\r\n\r\nUse with the knowledge also that there is a greatly enhanced Enterprise solution to upgrade to. The Enterprise solution offering for example full Java scripting, single desktop support, and faster / improved search algorithms etc.\r\n\r\nTo contact us please view our website.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tplanrobot", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rpes/", "username": "rpes", "name": "Robert Pes"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/wheech/", "username": "wheech", "name": "wheech"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.t-plan.com/robot"}
