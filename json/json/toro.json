The threads of the user application server are distributed evenly on all CPUs and running independently in parallel. The memory model chosen is NUMA without pagination. During the initialization, the memory is divided proportionally for each processor installed on the system. When a thread needs memory, the memory allocator returns a free block of memory depending on which CPU the thread is running. In the same way, TORO can dedicate resources to specific processor, i.e. a FileSystem. This only CPU then can access to this instance of FileSystem. The scheduler is based on the cooperative threading model, therefore due to this design, TORO can migrate threads between CPUs and send messages between threads without using any lock instruction. TORO is well suited for integrated system to run at high pace application servers like web servers, database server", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "toro", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kheewee/", "username": "kheewee", "name": "Khee Wee"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/z0rr0/", "username": "z0rr0", "name": "Matias"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.torokernel.io"}
