There are many different creative scenes to keep you entertained. Instead of drawing animation we took the time to physically set up each picture and rearrange the characters. Ongoing updates are scheduled to add another 50 levels to the game! Look for new characters, different themes, and a greater variety. Level difficulty is in the medium range. Some of the levels branch into difficult and easy.
