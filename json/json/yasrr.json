These services can be either human consumable (web sites, widgets and/or portlets) or machine consumable (REST, SOAP, JMS, MQ, FTP, RMI, etc) services.  The adoption and usage of UDDI has made clear that it is not the answer to the dynamic discovery and consumption model.  This Service-Registry project targets the next generation of application and how they will both publish and consume run-time service and propogate registry entries across a network of registries.\r\n\r\nFurther, other registries loose value over time as they eventually get filled with garbage that makes it difficult to discern good entries from defunct entries.  Service-Registry is designed to be \"self cleaning\" keeping the usefulness of registry high.\r\n\r\nService-Registry also has a robust federation strategy and implementation to allow registry entries move about the service ecosystem.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "yasrr", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jmsimpson/", "username": "jmsimpson", "name": "Jeff Simpson"}], "external_homepage": "http://service-registry.sourceforge.net"}
