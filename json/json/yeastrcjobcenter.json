The client and server components are both written in Java and are cross-platform and relatively easy to install. All communication with the server is client-driven, which allows worker nodes to run anywhere (even behind external firewalls or “in the cloud”) and provides inherent load balancing. Adding a worker node to the worker pool is as simple as dropping the JobCenter client files onto any computer and performing basic configuration, which provides tremendous ease-of-use, flexibility, and limitless horizontal scalability. Each worker installation may be independently configured, including the types of jobs it is able to run. Executed jobs may be written in any language and may include multistep workflows.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "yeastrcjobcenter", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/djaschob/", "username": "djaschob", "name": "Dan Jaschob UW"}], "external_homepage": null}
