Therefore we created Web-TCGA, a web based, freely accessible online tool, for integrated analysis of molecular cancer data sets, provided by the TCGA. In contrast to already available tools, Web-TCGA utilizes different methods and visualization techniques, allowing to create global molecular profiles across different cancer entities at the same time. In addition to global molecular profiles, Web-TCGA offers highly detailed gene and tumor entity centric analysis by providing interactive tables and views.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "webtcga", "developers": [], "external_homepage": "http://webtcga.sourceforge.net"}
