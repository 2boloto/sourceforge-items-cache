We're using the DICT format, a format analogous to Babylon Translator's glossary files but that is supported by a number of open source packages.\r\n\r\nThough Tzotzil has only about 2700 roots, the combination between roots and affixes can be immensively productive, resulting in hundreds of thousands of words. This project is at its very beginning and we're looking for collaborators.\r\n\r\nTzotzil is a language of the Mayan family spoken by about 330 thousand people in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tzotzildict", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/wernerbr/", "username": "wernerbr", "name": "Werner Hertzog"}], "external_homepage": ""}
