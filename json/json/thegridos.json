Anyone on the grid os should be able to have this handled for them automatically, instead of having to set up such a system.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to put this project in motion, join.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "thegridos", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jeremynull/", "username": "jeremynull", "name": "Jeremiah0000"}], "external_homepage": ""}
