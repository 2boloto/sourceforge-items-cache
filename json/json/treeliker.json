The data can, for example, describe large organic molecules such as proteins or groups of individuals such as social networks or predator-prey networks etc. The algorithms included in TreeLiker are unique in that, in principle, they are able to search given sets of relational patterns exhaustively, thus guaranteeing that if some good pattern capturing an important feature of the problem exists, it will be found. In experiments with real-life data, the algorithms were shown to be able to construct complete non-redundant sets of patterns for chemical datasets involving several thousands of molecules as well as for comparably large datasets from genomics or proteomics.\r\nThe included relational learning algorithms are tailored towards so-called tree-like features for which some otherwise very hard sub-problems (NP-hard) become tractable.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "treeliker", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ida225b/", "username": "ida225b", "name": "IDA"}], "external_homepage": "http://ida.felk.cvut.cz/treeliker/"}
