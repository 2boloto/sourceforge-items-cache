Based on the BSD licensed OpenCV, TrackXY also has BSD-style license.\r\n\r\nI am a bit embarrassed to be posting this here, because it's such a rudimentary program, but I couldn't find any other ready-made program that would track an object in real-time from webcam, other than an $80 special-purpose program used in the original (torsion balance) experiment we were replicating. I released TrackXY to reduce barriers to entry to science.\r\n\r\nPlanned features include versions for each platform, a GUI, comprehensive data management, and data analysis tools.\r\n\r\nTo analyze motion in /recorded/ video (not real-time), you may prefer something like PhysMo, also a SourceForge project.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trackxy", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/liamdgray/", "username": "liamdgray", "name": "Liam D.
