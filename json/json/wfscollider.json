WFSCollider functions as a full DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), with a timeline editor, effect chains and realtime live control. \r\n\r\nThe supercollider programming language, which forms the base of the program, also enables users to fully script and adapt the system to their liking. However, knowledge of SuperCollider is not required for normal use. \r\n\r\nWhen installing the software on a (home) system without WFS it can run in various \"preview\" modes, so that projects can be developed away from an actual system.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wfscollider", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/wsnoei/", "username": "wsnoei", "name": "Wouter Snoei"}], "external_homepage": "https://github.com/GameOfLife"}
