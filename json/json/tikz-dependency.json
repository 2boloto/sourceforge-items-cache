It comes with a very comprehensive documentation that will get you started in 10 minutes, even without any prior knowledge of TikZ.\r\n\r\nIt also provides a lot of styling facilities, to let you personalize the look and feel of the graphs at your liking.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tikz-dependency", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/masterpiga/", "username": "masterpiga", "name": "Masterpiga"}], "external_homepage": ""}
