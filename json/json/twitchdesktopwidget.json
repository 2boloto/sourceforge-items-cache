Right now it's setup to only allow 5 to be viewed, I may expand on that later down the road.\r\n\r\nAutomatic update after x minutes (Default is 5 minutes, you can set this in options menu)\r\nManually update (If you click this and have automatic set it resets timer for refresh)\r\nIf not live, text is red on name.\r\nIf live, text is green on name.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n\r\nI do not own Twitch.tv nor do I own LiveStreamer. I created neither and have no rights to either. This is just a GUI to bundle the two together to further utilize these tools. I also do not own the Twitch.tv logo used for the icon.\r\n\r\nAlso, the language this was written in is AutoIt3 which some anti viruses have deemed malicious. If you have any concerns about a firewall prevention please go to the following link for more information.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/34658-are-my-autoit-exes-really-infected/", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "twitchdesktopwidget", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rs-software/", "username": "rs-software", "name": "Robert Salatka"}], "external_homepage": "http://twitchdesktopwidget.sourceforge.net"}
