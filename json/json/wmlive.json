While its main purpose is to provide a show case for the Window Maker window manager, which serves as its default graphical user interface and therefore has received special preconfiguration care, it can also be considered as an alternative installation CD for Debian/Wheezy. As such, wmlive is fully compatible with and relies on the official Debian/Wheezy repositories for security updates and bug fixes.
