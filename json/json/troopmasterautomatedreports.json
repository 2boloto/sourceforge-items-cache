When tied together with solutions like Dropbox and linked to your website it is possible to quickly provide updated reports for your Troop's leaders, boys, and parents.\r\n\r\nThe library will briefly take control of your computer to start TroopMaster DotNet, create a predefined set of PDF reports (common reports that our large Troop currently uses today) as if you were doing the mouse movements, mouse clicking, and keyboard entry yourself.\r\n\r\nCurrently this works with Windows and TroopMaster 2013 client pulling from DotNet.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to have your computer not lock after being idle, you can set the reports to run on a scheduled basis using Window's task scheduler, otherwise you can run the entire suite of reports with a simple double click of your mouse.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "troopmasterautomatedreports", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/joshuamartin/", "username": "joshuamartin", "name": "Joshua Martin"}], "external_homepage": null}
