Currently the only language supported is German, but it can very easily be adapted to support other languages. This library spans ~370 lines of C++ code. At the moment there is no real documentation, pleas refer to the comments in the code, they should be quite helpful. A sample is also included. This library is not based on any algorithm published on the internet or elsewhere and it works without a dictionary. The Library is written in C++ and is tested under GCC 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9\r\n\r\n[Use it in any way you want, including commercial work, but please include my name and a link to this page]", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tinyhyphenator", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ijake1111/", "username": "ijake1111", "name": "DuffsDevice"}], "external_homepage": "http://tinyhyphenator.sourceforge.net"}
