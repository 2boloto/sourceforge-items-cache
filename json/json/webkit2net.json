The reason for that is simple: the Apple port does not compile WK2 on Windows anymore since they dropped Safari for Windows, the WinCairo port never compiled with WK2, and the QT port moved out of trunk and has been partially discontinued. So there is currently no WK2 implementation compiling out of the box on Windows that could be used with this wrapper. As the web moves on quickly it's useless to maintain a wrapper bound to stale binaries.\r\n\r\nIf you want this project for it's name, mail me and I will add you to and delete myself from the Admins group.\r\n\r\nThank you everybody for giving it a try and for all your upvotes.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "webkit2net", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ifdefdebug/", "username": "ifdefdebug", "name": "ifdefdebug"}], "external_homepage": null}
