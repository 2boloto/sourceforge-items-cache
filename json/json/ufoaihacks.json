Patches include an explanation and instructions. Hacks are tested on Debian GNU/Linux 7.   \r\n\r\nHacks focus on improving AI player behavior in single-player battles of a full campaign. Emphasis on AI player behavior for asymmetric, urban warfare.\r\n\r\nUFO:AI 2.4 has AI players rely on textbook, large-scale army tactics during battles. Those tactics aren't appropriate for the battlegrounds of the game. The battlegrounds are small, closed spaces with lots of hiding places and stalemate positions. Large-scale army tactics would be appropriate if most of the battlegrounds were open landscapes with few hiding places. Secondly, the AI players fight in small numbers or alone. All of which makes for a very stupid, predictable battle. Most of the time, the AI players run across the map as fast as they can, herd together, then stand there waiting to be killed.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ufoaihacks", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ufoaihacker/", "username": "ufoaihacker", "name": "ufoaihacker"}], "external_homepage": "http://ufoaihacks.sourceforge.net"}
