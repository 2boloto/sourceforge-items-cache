Moreover, the data is completely secure, as it is encrypted and stored.\r\n\r\nEach session is completely secured. The data is stored on the Local Hard Drive. The software does not interact with any network thus making the theft of the data almost impossible. The master key is also stored encrypted, thus making it further harder to get access to the data.\r\n\r\nWhile writing this software, at each step I have put the security of the data above everything else.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "viper-pw", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/icyflame/", "username": "icyflame", "name": "IcyFlame"}], "external_homepage": "http://siddharthkannan.webs.com"}
