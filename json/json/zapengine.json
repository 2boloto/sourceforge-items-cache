The engine will be at the end a bit more than a simple empty engine as it is meant to be a full working default game. Admin tools should allow to edit most if not all part of the games content like \"location contents\" (for example jobs), battle monsters, etc...\r\nThe game will take a full modular design, and will allow new developers to just develop modules without the requirement to change the core files or at least limit those.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "zapengine", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/udzstudios/", "username": "udzstudios", "name": "UDZ Studios"}], "external_homepage": null}
