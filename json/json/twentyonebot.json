Players continue rolling dice until the sum of all rolls is as close to 21 as possible, but don't go over!\r\n\r\nThis project is based off of the source for the same game which was written by Jason Hamilton and updated slightly more recently by LuizCB (aka pincel).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "twentyonebot", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rforder2/", "username": "rforder2", "name": "Robert Forder"}], "external_homepage": ""}
