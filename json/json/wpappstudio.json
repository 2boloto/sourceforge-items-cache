It eliminates or drastically reduces the upfront commitment of resources at your end. WPAS also allows us to meet more complex and advanced requirements without being limited to any client computer profile.\r\n\r\nWp App Studio plugin is a development tool used to design and send app metadata to WPAS servers. After app (plugin) metadata is sent, WPAS Servers generate the code and send you a link to your plugin's zip file. No coding is necessary to design your own custom plugins.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wpappstudio", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/emarket-design/", "username": "emarket-design", "name": "eMarket Design"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.wpappstudio.com"}
