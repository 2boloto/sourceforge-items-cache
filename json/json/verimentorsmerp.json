The aim is to provide a base template for ERP software vendors, and to make Business 2 Business dataexchange easy. \r\n\r\nThe thinking is from the users point of view in a very small (e.g. a Micro Company). Any user needs to work with different business processes and stakeholders every day. The user needs to quickly change focus from one very important issue to another equally important matter, without losing information, and effinency.\r\n\r\nIn this perspective I put together a very short embryo to idea, that I have visualized in a couple of screenshots. The stakeholders are in the tabbed menu in the right side of the screen and the business processes for each of those stakeholders is in the top of the screen. It is most likely that the user shifts focus more often between processes to the same stakeholder than the other way around.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "verimentorsmerp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/connywesth/", "username": "connywesth", "name": "Conny Westh"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bacr/", "username": "bacr", "name": "BACR"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/stemarie/", "username": "stemarie", "name": "Karell Ste-Marie"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jcollin/", "username": "jcollin", "name": "Jimm Collin"}], "external_homepage": "http://verimentorsmerp.sourceforge.net"}
