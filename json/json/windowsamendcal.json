With capability to shortcut a lot of long-ended processes and cut running extensive commands in half.\r\n\r\nOnce you download Cal for the first time, there is no need to ever reinstall again, as everything is installed and updated automatically. If you think your missing-out on all of what Cal can do, you can read the Wiki (WIP) to view all of Cal's current features.\r\n\r\nNote: This is a very early release of the Cal project.
