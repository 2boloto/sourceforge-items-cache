Its goal is to make it possible to create interactive characters out of a set of different independent modules, each of which has a designated role in the behavior of the character. Unlike most the other interactive character frameworks, there is no specific module to act as the Mind, neither as the Body. It supports and is largely based on the architecture of SAIBA/BML.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements:\r\n\r\nGAIPS/INESC-ID:\r\n(Intelligent Agents and Synthetic Characters Group)\r\nwww.gaips.inesc-id.pt\r\n\r\nEMOTE:\r\n(Embodied Perceptive Tutors for Empathic Based Learning)\r\nwww.emote-project.eu\r\n\r\nLIREC (LIving with Robots and Embodied Companions):\r\nwww.lirec.eu", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "thalamus", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/editullio/", "username": "editullio", "name": "Eugenio"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/tiagrib/", "username": "tiagrib", "name": "Tiago Ribeiro"}], "external_homepage": null}
