It also allows you to retrieve the text assigned to that variable. Lastly, it has a special variable called “Doing Now”. Every execution step consists of retrieving the contents of Doing Now, removing the first assign found in that content and performing that assign. In the course of performing that assign any retrieve operations indicated in the text are performed before committing the assign. That is all there the system does.\r\n\r\nThe driving motivation for this design is that as far as we know, the human mind supports these two instructions.It may have additional mechanisms that create new assigns, but using the results of these mechanisms requires a system built from these instructions.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wittgen", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/eliehrman/", "username": "eliehrman", "name": "Eli Ehrman"}], "external_homepage": "philcog.blogspot.com"}
