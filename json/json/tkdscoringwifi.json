"TKD Scoring Wi-Fi system was created by Taekwondo people like you and we use the scoring system in all our classes, just like you\r\nWe created this app few years ago to provide an effective, professional low cost solution with the same benefits and feeling experience, or even providing a better experience than any existing wired professional tournament solution\r\n\r\nThe success of the application in our Taekwondo sparring classes where our members described the application as “Holy crap this is incredible! This looks even more professional and easier to use than any of the programs I’ve ever seen used at comps.” and “Hey... just installed everything and it’s unreal! Everything works perfectly, looks great!” encouraged us to make it public for everybody\r\n\r\nLike any scoring system the “TKD Scoring Wi-Fi” system has few basic components:\r\n\r\n*TKD Scoring Wi-Fi Server(PC or Android)\r\n*TKD Scoring Wi-Fi Client(Android or IPhone)\r\n*TKD Scoring Wi-Fi Remote Score Display (Android)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tkdscoringwifi", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/dstoica/", "username": "dstoica", "name": "Dan Stoica"}], "external_homepage": "http://tkdscoringwifi.sourceforge.net/"}
