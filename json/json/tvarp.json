If you are interested in using it please let me know.  Currently it is designed for use with the SIMA-VS502 video switch, and I am using it in our local TV Station.  There are changes that need to be made to the source code to be able to use it elsewhere.   I am considering moving to using the ATEM switchers for playback in HD.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tvarp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/zrs/", "username": "zrs", "name": "Zach"}], "external_homepage": "http://tvarp.sourceforge.net"}
