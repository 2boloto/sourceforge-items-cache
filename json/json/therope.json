Development of a mixed reality computer game\" at the University of Bremen (Germany), Department of Mathematics and Computer Science.\r\nIt is an interactive installation, layed out as a game for two players: The first player tries to cross a virtual canyon (which is projected onto the floor), walking on nothing but a virtual rope, balancing in order to keep himself from falling down. The second player holds a real rope, pulling it to prevent the virtual one from shaking and thus reducing his mate's chance of failure. But caution: In case of pulling the real rope too hard, the virtual one might rip and the game is lost as well. The game will be controlled using the Microsoft Kinect camera to track the first player's movement. \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "therope", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/masscraxx/", "username": "masscraxx", "name": "MassCraxx"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/onoelting/", "username": "onoelting", "name": "Oliver N."}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/florianjtb/", "username": "florianjtb", "name": "Florian Born"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/lejugg/", "username": "lejugg", "name": "Michele Kr√ºger"}], "external_homepage": "therope.oliver-noelting.de"}
