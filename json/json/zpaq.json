Journaling means that the archive is append-only and you can revert to an earlier state to recover old versions of files.\r\n\r\nCompression is based on the open ZPAQ standard, a self-describing format that preserves compatibility as improved algorithms are developed. The default compression level is faster than zip with better compression. Typical speed for 100 GB is 1-2 hours for a full backup and 1-2 minutes for incremental backups of files whose date has changed.\r\n\r\nzpaq includes the public domain libzpaq API in C++ providing compression and decompression services to developers. zpaq includes development tools for writing and debugging custom compression algorithms in the ZPAQL language.\r\n\r\nDownload from http://mattmahoney.net/dc/zpaq.html\r\n(The download button does not work.
