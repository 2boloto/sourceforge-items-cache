What this basically does is it allows you to check whether two values are the same, even if one is in simple and the other in capital. You can check anything, dates, times, hashes, numbers, letters, whatever with ease.\r\n\r\nI got this idea when I needed to compare two hash values but I did not want to waste time on it, so I used Excel to do it.\r\n\r\nTo make a basic version yourself, enter the formula\r\n\r\n=IF(A1=B1,\"Both values are the same\",\"The values are not the same\") \r\n\r\nI do not have either compatibility versions, installer versions, macro versions, good UI versions etc... as I do not have enough time as of now.\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues, feel free to submit a support ticket and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day!\r\n\r\nPS:- This program does not calculate hashes, but only verifies already calculated hashes with a program like hashdeep with the original hash.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "valuechecker", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/sanoo/", "username": "sanoo", "name": "Sanuja Rajasinghe"}], "external_homepage": "http://valuechecker.sourceforge.net"}
