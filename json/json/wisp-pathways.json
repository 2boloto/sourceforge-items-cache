Dynamical network analysis has been used to model this cooperation, helping to computationally explain how binding to an allosteric site can impact the behavior of a primary site often many angstroms away. Traditionally, computational efforts have focused on the most optimal path of correlated motions leading from the allosteric to the primary active site. We present a program called Weighted Implementation of Suboptimal Paths (WISP) capable of rapidly identifying additional suboptimal pathways that may also play important roles in the transmission of allosteric signals. Aside from providing signal redundancy, suboptimal paths traverse residues that, if disrupted through pharmacological or mutational means, could modulate the allosteric regulation of important drug targets.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wisp-pathways", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/atvanwart/", "username": "atvanwart", "name": "Adam Van Wart"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jdurrant/", "username": "jdurrant", "name": "jdurrant"}], "external_homepage": null}
