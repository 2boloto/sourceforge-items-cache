Both failover_test and failover_test_Beta need read access to the SAP IDM database and the HR_Sample table. Failover group.xml will need to be updated to reflect the IP addresses of in the failover test files.\r\n2-If you try to adjust the failover group config, it can be somewhat tricky. Please consult the blog entry at [] for advice on changing the enable status of the groups.\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vdsfailover", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mattpollicove/", "username": "mattpollicove", "name": "Matt Pollicove"}], "external_homepage": "http://vdsfailover.sourceforge.net"}
