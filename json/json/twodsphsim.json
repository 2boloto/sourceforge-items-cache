It's possible to load data with two different methods. One based on geometry objects, the second one on placing every SPH particle on it's own.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to save simulations and to restart calculations from this safepoints. A tempSave-file is written to restart simulations, if they crash from an earlier point.\r\n\r\nNow in v2 an example is added with a FEM beam and a moving piston. Both are hardcoded in the code and must be changed if you want to use it otherwise. \r\n\r\nNow it can be used only 1 bar and 1 piston, for future it will be changed.\r\n\r\nVideo of textcase: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLYVSWkhXBI\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftware is tested and runs stable with up two 5000 SPH particles.\r\n\r\nKnown Problems:\r\n\r\nIf there are more than 15000-20000 SPH particles, after some simulationssteps the calculation slows down and gains all memory.
