It makes it possible to program I2C devices in scripting languages like Python or Tcl and can be used for rapid software prototyping, troubleshooting and debugging embedded systems. \r\n\r\nThe TWIDGET can be built using inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware, such as the MSP430 LaunchPad evaluation board available from Texas Instruments for measly $4.30.
