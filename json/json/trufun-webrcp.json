At present WebRCP has already been succeeded in transplanting to GWT platform from eclipse user’s interface SWT,JFace,UI, RCP, excellent Graphical editing framework Eclipse GEF, model editing framework Eclipse EMF and Eclipse UML2 etc.. Developer ,with a few modification, can switch the applications developed by eclipse SWT or eclipse RCP to GWT, then turns them into WEB program.\r\n\r\nUsers can transplant applications developed by the eclipse platform to the WEB on the basis of webrcp, also may develop the new WEB applications based on the API of powerful eclipse platform. The typical case is like new WEB vectorgraph application developed on the base of GEF API and EMF/UML 2 API, such as flow chart,engineering drawing,UML modeling,GIS .\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "trufun-webrcp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mrwjw/", "username": "mrwjw", "name": "keven"}], "external_homepage": "http://code.google.com/p/trufun-webrcp/"}
