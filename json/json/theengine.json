The interpreter is not chiefly designed for speed, but for comfortable development.\r\n\r\nThe editor and command screen use a custom 8 x 8 font on a 64x16 character text display. There are currently three switchable screens: Game screen, Output/Command screen, and Editor screen.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "theengine", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ekkehardm/", "username": "ekkehardm", "name": "Ekkehard Morgenstern"}], "external_homepage": ""}
