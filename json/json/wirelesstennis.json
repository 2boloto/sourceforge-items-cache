The project uses two Dragon12-Plus2SM boards equipped with a nRF24L01+ transceiver adapter from Addicore. \r\nThe project depicts a \"wireless tennis game\". The purpose of the game is for users to type button patterns and \"pass\" them to the opponent. The opponent has a brief moment to see the pattern being played on the LEDs and then he needs to retype the pattern. If retype was correct, a new pattern is \"passed back\" just like a tennis ball is passed by the players from one court to the other.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wirelesstennis", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/lmeeuwsen/", "username": "lmeeuwsen", "name": "LDMHD"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/radrian/", "username": "radrian", "name": "R.
