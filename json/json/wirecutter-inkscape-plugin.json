These closed paths \r\n(e.g. Letters) must be connected because the cutter cannot leave the\r\nraw material like a milling machine. The Plugin helps you to create \r\nthese connectors.\r\nIf you have a wirecutter with a turning table you can create multiple\r\n\"cuts\" for different positions of the turning table.\r\n\r\nThis software is not really tested and is still in development.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wirecutter-inkscape-plugin", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/retowechner/", "username": "retowechner", "name": "Reto Wechner"}], "external_homepage": null}
