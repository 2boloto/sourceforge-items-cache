For this purpose it is assumed that there is an unambiguous way to order all tournament participants by strength. After that, the lots are drawn and the final ranking is compared to the expected. This process is done very often and statistical values are calculated.\r\n\r\nThis software was developed for the sport Jugger but should be usable for any kind of tournament.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tugeny", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/nythagoras/", "username": "nythagoras", "name": "Nythagoras"}], "external_homepage": "http://tugeny.sourceforge.net"}
