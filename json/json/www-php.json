It is made for web services, websites and info-systems and is built to support a native API architecture, caching, user control and smart resource management. Wave is a compact framework that does not include bloated libraries and features and is developed keeping lightweight speed and optimizations in mind. While not necessary for using Wave Framework, it comes by default with a URL and View controllers intended for building websites by solving URL requests and loading views.\r\n\r\nMercurial and Git repositories is available for developers who are interested in following the development.\r\n\r\nOfficial website and documentation:\r\nhttp://www.waveframework.com\r\n\r\nSocial networks for latest news: \r\nGoogle+ - http://plus.google.com/106969835456865671988 \r\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/waveframework \r\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/WWWFramework", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "www-php", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/kristovaher/", "username": "kristovaher", "name": "Kristo Vaher"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.waveframework.com"}
