Each card depicts an invention. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the game reveals the year this invention was created in. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.\r\n\r\nThe first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. Game continues until all players run out of cards in their hands.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "timelineinvent", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/martin-ambrus/", "username": "martin-ambrus", "name": "Martin Ambruš"}], "external_homepage": "http://timeline-inventions.com/"}
