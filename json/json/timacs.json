The project aims at reducing the complexity of the manual administration of computing systems by realising a framework for intelligent Manangement of even very large computing systems based on technologies for virtualising, knowledge-based analysis and validation of collected information, definition of metrics and policies. In scope of the national project TIMaCS (www.timacs.de), sponsored by German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), we developed a hierarchical, scalable, policy and knowledge based monitoring and management framework, capable to monitor and manage proactively very large computing systems. This project on sourceforge indends to continue development of the TIMaCS framework.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "timacs", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/hpcevolk/", "username": "hpcevolk", "name": "Eugen Volk"}], "external_homepage": "www.timacs.de"}
