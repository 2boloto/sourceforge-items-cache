As many suspected but has not become widely known, xor is NP Complete. See design docs for proof, and soon this minimalist language will have the first working download up. Xor is a constraint between any 2 nodes that they must be one 0 and the other 1 (either way), but its a fuzzy constraint as Max Xor is not NP Complete unless you have some xors that can be satisfied and others not. Loops of even length are trivially satisfied if any part is. xorlisp will be first a fun puzzle game, a few basic functions, expand into a massively multiplayer paint program as I've been planning in my AI research for a long time, and eventually implement my theory of gravity which Max Xor very directly defines in how a set of nodes which are constrained to have half 0s and half 1s (which I call a zoset, zero one set) is emulated by an xor on each pair of its nodes, and surprisingly, despite it having the same number of 0s and 1s, more than half of its xors are 1 at all times.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "xorlisp", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/benrayfield/", "username": "benrayfield", "name": "BenRayfield"}], "external_homepage": null}
