An interactive \"send and receive\" utility is included as an example. You may want to build on to these libraries for your specific instruments. Basically, if you've got a Programmer's Reference for your instrument and this code, you should be able to cobble something together.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vxi11", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/jssmith67/", "username": "jssmith67", "name": "Jane Smith"}], "external_homepage": "http://optics.eee.nottingham.ac.uk/vxi11/"}
