On the other hand, traffic information carried by communication may also influence the vehicles' future driving behavior. For example, through ITS, drivers may get some information from the traffic administrator and these information can be used for avoiding accidents, directing traffic or controlling topology. Especially, the existing simulation tools are either for the simulation of communication, such as NS2/NS3, opnet, either for the traffic flow simulation, such as SUMO. Though some simulation tools integrate the simulation of communication and traffic flow, most of them face problems on scalability and cannot support interactions between trav", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vehiclesimulator", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/longjiangli/", "username": "longjiangli", "name": "Longjiang Li"}], "external_homepage": null}
