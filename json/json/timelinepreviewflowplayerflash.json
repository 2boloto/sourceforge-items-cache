Simply replace the standard controls plugin with this one and you get the preview functionality with mp4s out of the box. All the heavy lifting is done by the preview plugin and happens behind the scene for you. The stills are actually the mp4 key frames extracted and decoded on the fly from the video file. If your videos are hosted on a domain different from the one where Flowplayer Flash is embedded you would need as well upload a small html file to that host to allow for ajax byte-range requests from the plugin.\r\nWorks in all major browsers.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "timelinepreviewflowplayerflash", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/antonbilan/", "username": "antonbilan", "name": "Easy-Bits.com"}], "external_homepage": "http://easy-bits.com/products/timeline-preview-plugin-flowplayer-flash"}
