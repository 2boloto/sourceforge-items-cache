The interface is similar to other motion capture applications (e.g. Blender), but is more convenient in getting started with the 3-Space Sensor units since the application was created for them. It automatically searches for 3-Space Sensor units already in use by the computer on start-up of the application and can load in previous sessions that saved off 3-Space Sensor information. However, it can only set-up and record motion data. It cannot edit or clean-up the motion data like other motion capture applications. Do not sweat though, because the Mocap Studio can export its motion data using the BVH (Biovision Hierarchy) format which is a widely used form for motion capture data.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "yeimocap", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/chris-george/", "username": "chris-george", "name": "Christopher George"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/yostengineering/", "username": "yostengineering", "name": "Yost Engineering Inc."}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/sambushman/", "username": "sambushman", "name": "Sam Bushman"}], "external_homepage": "http://tech.yostengineering.com/3-space-sensor/mocap-studio"}
