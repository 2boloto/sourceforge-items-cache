Linux is a free Kernel which thousands of OS's run on up to date. faba takes a mesh of different and varying Linux distributions and blends it all together to make an easy to use OS. faba is meant for everybody. From little kids, to the mature business man. From your home office, to that meeting next week. faba is built for it all.\r\n\r\nWhere did the name \"faba\" come from?\r\n\r\nThe name faba (originally F.A.B.A.) literally stands for \"Family and Business Alike.\" That's the foundation of the project. We have modified several distributions to make one easy and efficient for everybody. It's built for the world!\r\n\r\nWhen does each version/update get released?\r\n\r\nIt depends on the changes the project gets. But since it's mostly based on an Ubuntu platform, it will probably get released each time the next version of Ubuntu does.\r\n\r\nCan we make changes to it?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely! Linux is open-sourced. And unlike most remasters, faba OS allows for users to get onto the forum (soon to come) and add their own ideas/contributions (after being verified by Alex Garner [the project master]) then added straight to the next release or even update.\r\n\r\nHow can we install it, or just test it?\r\n\r\nfaba is easily installable inside of your PC. Just boot from the CD. An installer will guide you the entire way. If you are just testing it out, you can run it inside of a Virtual Machine* or boot from the LIVE CD** and try it out at boot-up!\r\n*I/we do not own any Virtual Machine software, nor distribute it at this time.\r\n** LIVE CD feature may not be available in version one as of this time. It may be possible by (hopefully) BETA or RC.
