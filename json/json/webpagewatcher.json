Well here is the solution. This application does the work for you. All you need to do is specify which movie or a show you are waiting for and the program will check the web every 5 minutes to see if the movie or a show has already been released. Another feature is to check for a certain phrase on a webpage you specify. Let's say you are waiting for results of a test you took. Just input a webpage where the results will appear and a phrase such as \"results\". The application will let you know about the results.
