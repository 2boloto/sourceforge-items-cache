The primary goal of the toolkit is ease of use (short learning curve), lightweight self-contained executables, UI speed, cross platform compatibility, and minimal dependencies.  The primary goal of the workbench is to provide an editor on X11 platforms that integrates development, provides rapid development tools (like 'wizards' and safe X11 debugging), and allows you to move the cursor past the end of a line without creating 'end of line' whitespace or 'bouncing' the cursor horizontally while scrolling vertically.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "x11workbench", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bombasticbob/", "username": "bombasticbob", "name": "Bob Frazier"}], "external_homepage": "http://x11workbench.sourceforge.net"}
