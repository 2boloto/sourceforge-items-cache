I might adapt it for US keyboards if there's enough interest.\r\n\r\nThe driver should be stable (built using MSKLC, which is mature) but classified as beta because it has not yet been tested on a wide variety of systems (please give feedback!)\r\n\r\nNote that this can't display characters not supported in fonts on your system!  Also if you enter an unusual symbol in some programs such as MS Word the font might switch to one which includes that symbol â€“ this isn't anything the driver can control.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "uksuperextendedkeyboard", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/aswaine/", "username": "aswaine", "name": "Andrew Swaine"}], "external_homepage": "http://www.swaine.me.uk/keyboard"}
