If anyone would like to work on this project with me, just send me a message and we can see about that.\r\n\r\nLatest Update:\r\nThe Engine beats me easily now, and I have pre-programmed 4 different difficulties into the release of version 2.0. The idea is that 1.0 was a chess app, and 2.0 is a chess engine. Hope you enjoy playing against the engine!
