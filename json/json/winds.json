Since i started coding Apps for the NDS, my goal was to write a program, called WinDS, which does (nearly) the same as the real appy by Microsoft. In contrast to other little NDS-Operating Systems, just like Woopsi etc. you can code your own Application in Lua for WinDS: just copy the Code onto the FAT-Disk and execute it from within WinDS! This is what makes WinDS so unique.\r\n\r\nThe New Beta 0.95 is out, it features\r\n\r\n- 52 Classes that are already available within Lua\r\n- 25 different types of user interface classes\r\n- 8 different predefined dialogs\r\nwhich makes it the perfect GUI sandbox for DS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: More time without update means: next update will have even more improvements, as i am still developing ;)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "winds", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ijake1111/", "username": "ijake1111", "name": "DuffsDevice"}], "external_homepage": "http://palmato.com/WinDS"}
