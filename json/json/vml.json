The log file will be used in detailed microanalysis research, and will also allow researchers to generate reports to obtain a visual representation of the data. This log file will allow researchers and administrators to better understand exactly how the participants are interacting with the Virtual Math Team system, and find ways to improve its functionality. In addition to analyzing the data, the log file will be used to determine whether or not the groups were actually participating in learning based exercises during their session. These sessions are organized to allow the participants to interact with each other in order to solve math-based problems.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "vml", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/hislop/", "username": "hislop", "name": "Gregory Hislop"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rlw889/", "username": "rlw889", "name": "Rob Wallace"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mlit484/", "username": "mlit484", "name": "Mike Litwa"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/rapeldor/", "username": "rapeldor", "name": "Robert Apeldorn"}], "external_homepage": "http://gerrystahl.net/vmt/"}
