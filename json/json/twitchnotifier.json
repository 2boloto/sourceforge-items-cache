After each iteration, the application pauses itself for five minutes.\r\nThe loop is pretty basic:\r\n\r\n1: Retrieve the names of the people being followed.\r\n\r\n2: Check which of those names are streaming.\r\n\r\n3: Compare those names that are streaming with the last check.\r\n\r\n      3.5: If someone else started streaming since the          last check - notify the user.\r\n\r\n4: Pause then repeat.\r\n\r\nThe actual iteration takes about five seconds, but the application pauses for five minutes after each check.\r\n\r\n\r\nI created this tool because I like watching TwitchTV streams, but I found that I would miss when people would stream because I was not constantly checking to see who was. The idea I had when I was creating this was to make something that does the job using as little attention, space, and processing power as possible.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "twitchnotifier", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/dudemartin/", "username": "dudemartin", "name": "Martin Tuskevicius"}], "external_homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/twitchnotifier/"}
