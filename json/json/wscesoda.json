It provides an extensible set of web-development libraries.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to develop a range of useful classes and mechanisms to support the rapid development of web-applications.\r\n\r\nThe Web Site Creation Engine (WSCE) is used to generate pages' html, helping to ensure that html is W3C compliant, resulting is faster rendering at the browser, higher search engine rankings and better cross browser compatibility.\r\n\r\nSODA is object-orientated. The code takes advantage of inheritance to organise common capabilities into class hierarchies, and interfaces are used to encourage compatibility of objects between different class trees.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "wscesoda", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/tantric-tech/", "username": "tantric-tech", "name": "Tantric Technologies Co-op Ltd"}], "external_homepage": "www.tantric,coop"}
