Or you can easily use (cut&copy) calculated paths and use it in your own G CODE file.\r\n\r\nThis application is portable, it does not write anything to registry (or anywhere else). This app does not 'phone home' or collect any user information in any way.\r\nJust download file and place it anywhere on HD (we recommend simple location like 'C:\\Tube3D\\...' or similar simple path.\r\n\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tube3d", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/factor-y/", "username": "factor-y", "name": "FACTORY"}], "external_homepage": "http://tube3d.sourceforge.net"}
