TAP is sensor‑driven, e.g.: acting when a critical level is reached, providing people with alternative water supply from tank trucks nearby.\r\n\tOn the other side, trucks have their logistics optimized, once their status information is shared.\r\n\tIt is assumed a scenario with more than a thousand tank trucks, all of them equipped with GPS devices. \r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "theaquaproject", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/barbado/", "username": "barbado", "name": "Marcio Barbado, Jr."}], "external_homepage": "http://theaquaproject.sourceforge.net"}
