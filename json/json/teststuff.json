Completely in 2D. There are no any story; you playing as the red square, looking for keys around on a level. Your enemies are:\r\n\r\nIdiot: blue square with rotating arrows, can move only up or down.\r\nThe Drunken Bot: looks like player, but it`s green and it smiles to you. Walks in random direction, the same way like player.\r\nA turret: shots in random direction with a constant interval. Bullets can fly through the walls.\r\nThe Boss: randomly moves left or right at the top of level, fires from two guns. Starts raging, when his health becomes low.\r\nThere are no savegames between levels, so if you`ll lost all backups and die somewhere at 15th level (for example), you will be returned to the first level. At the game's begin you have five backups; collecting of a big green square will give you one more backup (aka 1-UP).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "teststuff", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/medvedx64/", "username": "medvedx64", "name": "MEDVEDx64"}], "external_homepage": ""}
