Added a method to fill an array with random bytes - see GetRandBytes().\r\n\r\n5. Renamed methods, constants and types to something easier to use and remember.\r\n\r\n6. Better documentation,\r\n\r\n7. Wrote tests to show that both the C++ and C# versions produce the same rngs as the original C code.\r\n\r\n8. Added benchmark tests.\r\n\r\n9. Wrote a separate test project to benchmark pInvoke calls from C# to the TinyMT C++ methods.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tinymt", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/robertgbryan/", "username": "robertgbryan", "name": "RGB"}], "external_homepage": "https://github.com/jj1bdx/TinyMT"}
