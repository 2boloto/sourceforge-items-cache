This stage will allow users to explore the interface and perform all actions available in the YGO card game. This stage also will not contain images of each YGO card; rather, words will be substituted for images.\r\n\r\nEstimated time of completion: Mid November\r\n(See the CHANGELOG file)\r\n\r\n2: Fully automated GUI with all actions scheduled and handled by the computer. Users will only have to  select options off of a menu.\r\n\r\n3: Full simulator with images, AI and multi-player (hopefully including LAN, Internet, and local).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ygoduelingsim", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/zaphhey/", "username": "zaphhey", "name": "Brian"}], "external_homepage": ""}
