The XTV file system is used on PVR, e.g. Sky+, to store recorded programmes. The class library can be used to copy unencrypted (i.e. free-to-air) programmes from a disk image.\r\n\r\nI wanted to extract a recorded program and I was not able to find an open-source tool that could, or even a programming library for accessing xtvfs, so I wrote one. I am calling this alpha as I only wrote it for myself and while it works for my use, it may not suite others. I am not intending to extend the code further but wanted to give others code to start from.
