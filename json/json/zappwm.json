Basically , you can drag applications , documents and folders to the panel , desktop and elsewhere . This is a characteristic of ROX .\r\n\r\nThe default shortcuts are focused for the most common applications of Ubuntu / Debian / Mint . But you can customize them to your like . If a shortcut does not work, simply remove the icon or install the corresponding application .\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "zappwm", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/bebetomaya/", "username": "bebetomaya", "name": "bruno "}], "external_homepage": null}
