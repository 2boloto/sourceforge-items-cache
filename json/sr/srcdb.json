It is implemented as a filesystem subtree. The key to the database consists of 2 fields: name and version separated by dash. In the filesystem the key is implemented as a 'name/version' subtree.\r\n\r\nSRCDB (util) is designed to:\r\n1) Populate its database with the data describing tarballs: name of the tarball, URLs of origin and contents checksums.\r\n2) Download and perform integrity checks of tarballs described by the database, given the database key.\r\n3) Inform other tools about location of a tarball in the local filesystem (or its absence), given the database key.\r\n\r\nSRCDB (util) is implemented as a shell-script for immediate availability. It is meant to be a personal tool for those who like to tweak software themselves.\r\n", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "srcdb", "_id": "500be6430594ca723c0000f2", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 831113, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "A tool for source code downloading and integrity checking", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 7 - Inactive", "shortname": "inactive", "fullname": "7 - Inactive", "id": 358}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: File Management", "shortname": "file_management", "fullname": "File Management", "id": 601}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Unix Shell", "shortname": "shell", "fullname": "Unix Shell", "id": 185}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "fullname": "Command-line", "id": 459}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: System Administrators", "shortname": "sysadmins", "fullname": "System Administrators", "id": 4}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "id": 200}]}}
