The area of sustainable manufacturing is rapidly evolving and includes a network of information standards that define the language of discourse for this new area.  Traditional document style standards and dictionary style definitions are very limiting when it comes to getting a holistic picture of the sustainability landscape for manufacturing. The task of understanding the challenges in achieving a sustainability objective is very difficult when non-experts have to browse through several pages of document standards to find relevant information. The NOVIS tool provides a means for people to interactively visualize, browse, and query these standards.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/disclaimer.cfm", "shortname": "novis", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1882548}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/novis/", "video_url": ""}
