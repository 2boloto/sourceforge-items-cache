Creating, modifying, or viewing a note activates that note, and causes a wave of spreading activation to propagate through the network to related notes. Highly active notes are suggested to the researcher as potential interesting. This replaces several manual tasks: searching for relevant resources, remembering old ideas in light of new information, avoiding fruitless repetitive investigations, and (most interestingly) integrating ideas in novel ways.", "shortname": "notenet", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A connectionist approach to conceptual workflow suggestions", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1281641}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/notenet/", "video_url": ""}
