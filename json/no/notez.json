The intention behind this project is to create a free and easy to use piece of software that gives you the opportunity to just quickly write something down without having to do a lot of formatting. This simplicity will be based on freely movable text-, image-, file- and table-tags (probably even more) that gives you the ability to perfectly capture all your ideas, plans and everything else you want to remember in the future. Additionally all your notes will be stored in one notebook so you won't have trouble finding anything anymore.
