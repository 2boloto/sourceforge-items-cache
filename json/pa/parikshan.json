I'm excited with this huge response. I believe a new, feature rich version will be very beneficial for the Education Community.\r\nSoon I'll start it's development from scratch but this time it'll be built in PHP, MySQL with a rich set of features and more intuitive, easy to use interface. For this I need volunteer developers and designers, who can help me in it's development. I'll create a separate Project Home Page for this project.\r\nInterested developers and designers can contact me via email through my SF profile page.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nNeeraj Semwal\r\nAuthor: Project Parikshan", "shortname": "parikshan", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 289620}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Mailing Lists", "mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/parikshan/", "video_url": ""}
