Although many pathway analysis tools have been developed for case-control study, there is no tool that can use all information from raw genotypes in general nuclear families. We developed the Pathway-PDT, which uses the framework of Pedigree Disequilibrium Test (PDT) for general family data, to perform pathway analysis.\r\n\r\nAvailability and implementation: Pathway-PDT is implemented in C++ with POSIX threads (pthreads). Binaries (Windows) and source codes with makefile (Linux) are available.\r\n\r\nContact: rchung@nhri.org.tw\r\n\r\nCitation:\r\nYo Son Park, Michael Schmidt, Eden R. Martin, Margaret A.
