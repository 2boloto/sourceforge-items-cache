For example to edit a field value, instead of using a TDBEdit component you can use a TChamp_Edit.\r\nIn a dataset, you can have access to one line at a time. But with this mapping you can build complex relations between all the objects, directly reflecting the underlying UML class diagram. For example in our planning software, tasks are read from a single table and end up displayed in a tree. Each object-task can be connected to objects representing teams, employees, vehicles, tools, a bit like a piece of fabric. \r\nYou can get several different views of this fabric, listing the planning of an employee,\r\nor the affectations of a tool. May be it's not completely impossible to achieve with datasets, but it's a lot more easier to do this way.\r\nSee wiki for more details soon", "shortname": "pascal-o-r-mapping", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "pascal object/relational mapping", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2329762}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pascal-o-r-mapping/", "video_url": null}
