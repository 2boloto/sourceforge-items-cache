Simply import the database dump from the database folder to create the necessary tables for the system to run. You can use either phpMyAdmin for localhost; Microsoft SQL Server; or simply Query Browser for MySQL. Other database environments have not been tested hence I don't guarantee their adaptability.\r\nii. Run and Build the system in NetBeans IDE 7.0. Other IDEs have not been tested for this system. A more stable and installable version will be released soon.\r\niii. Please rate the system and leave comments or reviews.\r\niv. If you need any further clarification, post a question/query/doubt in the Wiki and I will reply ASAP.\r\n\r\nNB: Please use the \"External Link\" menus above to support this project in one way or another.
