This is the Pascal-P4 compiler modified to be ISO 7185 Pascal compilant, both in the the implementation language, and in the language it processes. It is the first version of Pascal-P created outside of Zurich.\r\n\r\nPascal-P was an implementation kit, created between 1972 and 1974, for the original language Pascal. The source for the original compiler was passed around and modified quite a bit, but Niklaus Wirth noted that it was very popular, and represented a good method to popularize the language. He gathered the source into a clean version called Pascal-P2, which was the basis of UCSD Pascal, which in turn was the base language for Borland Pascal. The Zurich group then created an improved version called Pascal-P4.\r\n\r\nPascal-P5 is Pascal-P4 modified to accept all of the ISO 7185 language.", "shortname": "pascalp5", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "5th version of the Pascal-P compiler", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2264593}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pascalp5/", "video_url": null}
