ParTI finds the best fit polytopes and the corresponding archetypes, and indicates which features of the data are enriched near each archetype. The present approach is less sensitive to the density of sampling of the data space than clustering approaches, because it relies on the overall shape of the data and its pointy vertices; enrichment of relevant biological features is higher near the archetypes than near the centers of clusters obtained by standard methods.", "shortname": "parti", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Matlab package to perform Pareto Task Inference", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2397427}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/parti/", "video_url": null}
