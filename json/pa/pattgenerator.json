As its unimaginative name suggests, it generates graphical patterns by means of algorithms.

The static images can be saved as PNG files, and the animations can be saved as a sequence of PNG files that can be converted to a video by a tool such as FFmpeg.", "shortname": "pattgenerator", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Algorithmically generates two kinds of graphical pattern", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 872501}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pattgenerator/", "video_url": null}
