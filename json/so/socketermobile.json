The client feature of Socketer Mobile can connect to hosts on the network on different ports and send data and also receieve data.", "summary": "A simple socket debugging tool for Android devices.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 935778, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "socketermobile", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ishraq86/", "username": "ishraq86", "name": "Ishraq Ibne Ashraf"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketermobile/screenshot/SC20120918-124215.png", "caption": "Server", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketermobile/screenshot/SC20120918-124215.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketermobile/screenshot/SC20120918-124222.png", "caption": "Client", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketermobile/screenshot/SC20120918-124222.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketermobile/screenshot/SC20120918-124227.png", "caption": "About", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketermobile/screenshot/SC20120918-124227.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Handheld/Mobile/PDA", "fullname": "Handheld/Mobile/PDA", "shortname": "handhelds", "id": 314}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "fullname": "Java", "shortname": "java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "fullname": "Communications", "shortname": "communications", "id": 20}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "fullname": "Software Development", "shortname": "development", "id": 45}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Handheld/Embedded Operating Systems :: Android", "fullname": "Android", "shortname": "android", "id": 728}]}}
