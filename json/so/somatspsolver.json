Typical example of the software\u2019s usage is to find shortest path of a machining head during working on complicated surface of a work pieces (Determination of movement coordinates between drilling and grinding in accordance with requirements specified by the help of CAD system.) Moreover the software can be well used to solve other logistics problems (e.g. in transportation Vehicle Routing Problem or in energetic heating system pipes deployment) assuming an user specifies also weights of different paths. To solute this task the software uses four diverse algorithms of shortest path searching based on graph theory.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "somatspsolver", "_id": "4f68ae1a1be1ce3add000207", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 727281, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "This software is specialized on shortest path search within different.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
