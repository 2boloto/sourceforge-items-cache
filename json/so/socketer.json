It has both server and client functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen a developer is developing features that requires sockets and network communication often it is really useful to be able to verify that their code is actually establishing the network connection and the code is actually handling data exchange over the network.\r\n\r\nSocketer can open a server socket on a user chosen port and display the data receieved on that port. The client feature of Socketer can connect to hosts on the network on different ports and send data and also receieve data.", "summary": "A simple socket debugging tool.", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 925473, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "socketer", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ishraq86/", "username": "ishraq86", "name": "Ishraq Ibne Ashraf"}], "screenshots": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketer/screenshot/socketer_server.png", "caption": "Server", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketer/screenshot/socketer_server.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketer/screenshot/socketer_client.png", "caption": "Client", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketer/screenshot/socketer_client.png/thumb"}, {"url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketer/screenshot/socketer_about.png", "caption": "About", "thumbnail_url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/socketer/screenshot/socketer_about.png/thumb"}], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "id": 10}], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Toolkits/Libraries :: Qt", "fullname": "Qt", "shortname": "ui_qt", "id": 479}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "fullname": "C++", "shortname": "cpp", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Communications", "fullname": "Communications", "shortname": "communications", "id": 20}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development", "fullname": "Software Development", "shortname": "development", "id": 45}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "fullname": "32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "winnt", "id": 219}]}}
