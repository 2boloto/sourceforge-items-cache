The advanced version is called ISLEC, which used a Particle swarm based Gibbs free energy minimization approach to solve the equilibrium problem. At the same time, the Pitzer's model proposed by C. E. Harvie & J. Weare in 1980 was persisted.\r\nISLEC has many features:\r\n1. Single point calculation was used instead of line calculation\r\n2. Database was used instead of putting all the parameters in the input file\r\n3. The structure of the database is simple and flexible\r\n4. The algorithm for solving phase equilibrium is fast and robust\r\n5. Model parameters given in literature can be easily use\r\n6. Single temperature parameters and multi-temperature parameters have unified format\r\nEveryone can download the software and the source code on:\r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/islec/", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "solucalc", "_id": "4e7848e40594ca332a000994", "tools": [{"mount_point": "home", "name": "wiki", "label": "Home"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 596692, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
