Currently the parser only builds an AST and is on hold, and currently the std lib is what is under development.  This is pre-alpha since it's primarily a library and a bunch of unit tests.  In the near future it could at least be used as a C library for folks who wanted to do operations on Strings, RegExps, Lists, and HashTables which are simple in python.  When I get back to the compiler generating code I'll handle generics so Lists don't just contain void *s.", "summary": "An compiled object oriented language which uses the C ABI", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 724137, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "video_url": "", "socialnetworks": [], "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "sockeye", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/ckot/", "username": "ckot", "name": "Scott Silliman"}], "screenshots": [], "external_homepage": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Textual :: Command-line", "fullname": "Command-line", "shortname": "ui_commandline", "id": 459}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "fullname": "C", "shortname": "c", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "id": 679}], "database": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Object Oriented", "fullname": "Object Oriented", "shortname": "swdev_oo", "id": 562}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Compilers", "fullname": "Compilers", "shortname": "compilers", "id": 48}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "id": 770}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "fullname": "Developers", "shortname": "developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "fullname": "All POSIX (Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes)", "shortname": "posix", "id": 200}]}}
