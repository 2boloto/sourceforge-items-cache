Other applications include E-commerce, company intranets, and distance learning. QSonnet is based on 2 languages, QuadraScript and QSON. QuadraScript is similar to JavaScript, but with a simpler syntax. QuadraScript Object Notation (QSON) is used in place of HTML, and is very similar to JSON. However, QSON syntax is similar to QuadraScript, whereby parentheses are used for all grouping (except string literals are delimited with double quotes). Every QSON tag has a type property, which can either correspond to a built-in HTML tag, or a widget such as a button or checkbox. QSON widgets are called quadras. High-level game quadras include panel (similar to a top-level window), zone-grid (regions where multiple players congregate), and match (a 2-player animated game). QSonnet databases are built with MongoDB.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "qsonnet", "_id": "51bce0da7929e5146ef7bc9e", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1878163, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "Easily create multi-user HTML5 apps", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 1 - Planning", "shortname": "planning", "fullname": "1 - Planning", "id": 7}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools", "shortname": "build", "fullname": "Build Tools", "id": 46}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Game development framework", "shortname": "gameframeworks", "fullname": "Game development framework", "id": 794}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: Groupware", "shortname": "groupware", "fullname": "Groupware", "id": 849}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: JavaScript", "shortname": "JavaScript", "fullname": "JavaScript", "id": 280}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Web-based", "shortname": "web", "fullname": "Web-based", "id": 237}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
