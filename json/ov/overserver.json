The OverServer is an open-source tool for game developers who are working on network games and do not require a massively scalable backend for their network services but want a metaserver for their own games.\r\n\r\nOne particular strength of the player-hosted games setup is that it places the burden of Internet traffic on the player base and not a central server. OverServer tries not to violate this strength by keeping the query and response length very low to cut down on overhead from running the metaserver.\r\n\r\nI designed OverServer with a few lessons in mind from Valve and Won's metaserver setup for Half-life. It is at least somewhat resistant to attack through a challenge-response system for incoming requests. I also wanted the tool to be very simple to \"snap in\" to an existing application.", "shortname": "overserver", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple meta-server for locating other multiplayer servers", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2080350}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/overserver/", "video_url": ""}
