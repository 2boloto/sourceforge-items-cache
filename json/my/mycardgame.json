Initially, a number of stimulus cards are presented to the participant. The shapes on the cards are different in color, quantity, and design. The cards are to be matched first by color, then by design and then by quantity. The participant is given a stack of additional cards and asked to match each one to one of the stimulus cards, thereby forming separate piles of cards for each. The participant is not told how to match the cards; however, he or she is told whether a particular match is right or wrong. During the course of the test the matching rules are changed and the time taken for the participant to learn the new rules, and the mistakes made during this learning process are analysed to arrive at a score.\r\n\r\n", "shortname": "mycardgame", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Card Game is a neuropsychological test of \"set-shifting\"", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 845605}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mycardgame/", "video_url": ""}
