Thus can work on any OS and give lot of flexibility for generating your own report/graph with Excel features.\r\nThe core engine automatically downloads your statements from your online bank account. Specific dev is required per bank website. The first bank available will be Credit Mutuel (France), and then should follow BNP (France) and Citibank (USA).\r\nThe security aspect will be addressed, your online bank password is never stored in any config file.\r\nThe project is still under development.
