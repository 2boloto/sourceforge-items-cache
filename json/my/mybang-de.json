You can copy and paste it together if you want it even smaller.\r\nAt the moment the menu is very static. Im working currently on a more easier to use and even more flexible menu. There is a little demo included and a configuration menu. It even supports 2 languages (deu and eng) and you can freely add as many as you want.\r\nThere is currently no readme or manual or something. Just source the ink2_core.sh and run ink2_demo or open the ink2_menu_demo.sh and read the explanations there.\r\nHave fun to use and experiment with it.\r\n\r\nP.s.: use install.sh to 'install' it ;)", "shortname": "mybang-de", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "bash based menu system", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 275728}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mybang-de/", "video_url": null}
