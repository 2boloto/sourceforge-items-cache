Instead of creating a model and then applying a texture to it, you create the model by drawing it directly on the texture. Textures are embedded in saved model files so there is no problem with models getting separated from their textures. You can extract the textures any time and save them to bitmap files, modify and reload them into your model.  \r\n\r\nMultiple geometric mesh objects can be created from a single texture and combined into a three-dimensional model, with any seams quickly and accurately closed using the patented stitch technology. Solids of extrusion and revolution can be quickly created with texture map coordinates automatically applied at creation. Restricted vertex editing allows modification of three-dimensional geometry in situations where vertex selection would otherwise be ambiguous.
