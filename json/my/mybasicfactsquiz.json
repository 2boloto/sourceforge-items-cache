The software gives the student feedback once they have completed the quiz they are given, including the percentage correct.\r\n\r\nStudents can also choose a type or types of questions to do - useful for them to work on their weak spots at home. A teacher interface is included that will display a link on the screen ready to be copied and pasted where it needs to go to get to the students - or just displayed on an interactive whiteboard.\r\n\r\nThe project incorporates an animated cat from the project clippy-js.
