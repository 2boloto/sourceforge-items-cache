You can take MonsterBot anywhere in the world and set it up in a few minutes to build massive 3-D structures, such as houses, bridges, statues, and park fountains, along with entire water systems with water pumps, plumbing, and irrigation for remote villages, and even use it to pre-build structures (unattended!) on the moon and other planets for astronauts to occupy for long-term stays.  With currently-available build materials, virtually indestructible structures can be built for our troops in war zones to protect them from all sorts of dangers, up to direct rocket attacks.  The base configuration accommodates builds up to 12\" x 16\" x 12\", and extensions can be added to it (for just $100 per additional foot!) to produce just about any sized object that you want.", "shortname": "monsterbot3dprt", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Manufacturing Plant in a Suitcase - portable, expandable, huge builds", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1699165}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/monsterbot3dprt/", "video_url": ""}
