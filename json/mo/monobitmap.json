And thats a torture.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the reason I started this project.\r\nIt's a simple and small command line application which let you convert any (1-32bit) BMP into a string representation of 0 or 1, or even in hex. The program hasn't any problem with images up to 1000 * 1000 px.\r\n\r\nBtw, it's not as useful to tell you all about everything the program can do as to try yourself, just download it and feed it with an random BMP image, it's smaller than 200kB :)\r\n\r\nIf you're not on Windows you can use the Program with WINE or easily recompile it for your platform (You have to change the output coloring)\r\n\r\nProgram developement: finished", "shortname": "monobitmap", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Creates value-representation of any BMP file.", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1928647}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/monobitmap/", "video_url": ""}
