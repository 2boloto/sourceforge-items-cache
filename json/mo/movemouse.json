It will also optionally simulate a left mouse button 'click' after the move to raise the focus of the moved to location.\r\n\r\nAlthough it can be used on single monitor systems, the purpose of movemouse is to make it easy to jump between open windows on multiple monitor systems. When all screens are occupied with GUI applications and your hand is on the mouse anyway, movemouse is not so useful, but when you have your hands on the keyboard and want to jump to another window it is irritating to have to grab the mouse just to move the pointer to the other screen. This situation is where movemouse is very nice. \r\n\r\nIn particular I find movemouse useful when I have four open konsoles, two on each screen -- I jump between them without needing to take my hands off the keyboard. \r\n", "shortname": "movemouse", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "Move mouse pointer between screens with the keyboard", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 667082}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/movemouse/", "video_url": ""}
