This is due to the intrinsic connected-based nature of the way they are implemented. They rely on a web-server and a database server, or equivalent internal modules, to provide a standard connectivity mechanism through Internet to its services. Users are not able to access the platform if there is no Internet connection, resulting in a limitation of the LMS applicability in specific cases. With this project we present a solution to this issue with an offline application and we show a possible technical solution for the implementation. The result the work is a tool installed on the device of the learner who wants to use the courses given with the learning management system Moodle on his/her personal computer, even when he is not online.", "shortname": "mooffline", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 781850}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mooffline/", "video_url": ""}
