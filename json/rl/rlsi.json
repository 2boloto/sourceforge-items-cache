RLSI(Regularized Latent Semantic Indexing) is proposed to face the challenge of scalability issues in topic modeling. It is designed for parallelization and it is as effective as existing topic models, and scales to larger datasets without reducing input vocabulary. Given a collection of text documents, RLSI can find the relationship between terms and documents through latent topic. In addition, it can also be used in the research on machine learning, information retrieval, natural language processing, and other related fields.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rlsi", "_id": "51396aed85540d44433e5a1f", "tools": [{"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1343389, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "open source code for Regularized Latent Semantic Indexing", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
