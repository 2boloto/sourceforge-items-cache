To be specific, I have a Lenovo SR210 and when I runs RedFlag Linux, then I frequently have a over heated machine. \r\n\r\nThe short script monitorS the temperature of CPU and warn you when the system is overheated.\r\n\r\nYou can modify the code yourself, for example, change the critical level of temperature that suit you, and change the location of your ACPI\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is moved from Google Codes.
