The same tool is used to combine all the pieces of the file to get the original file back as it is.\r\n\r\nCommon uses in real life:\r\n1. Bypass the maximum attachment size limit:\r\nSending a .exe or a larger file through email by bypassing the maximum attachment size limitation.\r\n\r\n2. Overcome the portable storage limitation:\r\nIf we are not having a sufficient portable storage to transfer, say a muvie of a bigger size, we can cut the muvie file into number of pieces, transfre them to target computer and combine the pieces to get the original muvie back.\r\n\r\n2. Save data securely/privacy:\r\nThe tear-join operation can be password protected. If we want our important files to be kept confidential, tear them down using password. No one can read the teared out files. To recover the original file, join them back by using the password.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "tearjoin", "_id": "51a5f75f485acd75795fc37b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1817314, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Used to divide a big file into smaller pieces and later combine them.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
