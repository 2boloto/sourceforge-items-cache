Thus, I try to squeeze as much as possible from modern OpenGL features which can enhance code performance and/or manageability.

For development setups, 4.3 is partly relied upon for its debug capabilities.\r\n\r\nAlso, for development purposes the reference hardware is deliberately chosen from the slower end, preferably the slowest thing one has available with the chosen OpenGL profile support.
