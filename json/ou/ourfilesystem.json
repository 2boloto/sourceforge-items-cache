You can add information about files and perform sophisticated search queries to find files of interest and open them. Furthermore, if you share a file with someone else, you'll benefit from any further information they share about the file, even if they have an independent copy. For example, someone else may add a preview to a file, and as long as the SHA512 digest of the file matches your copy, you'll see the preview associated with your copy of the file. Someone else may mark another file as a re-encoded duplicate, or simply add more search terms. You can search information people have shared about their files and download a file from them if you do not already have it.  Files are shared within groups.  Anyone can create a group and only allow whom they wish to join.  Public and private messages are also supported.", "shortname": "ourfilesystem", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Peer-to-peer file-sharing system.", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "svn"}, {"label": "GITCode", "mount_point": "gitcode", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 672936}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/ourfilesystem/", "video_url": ""}
