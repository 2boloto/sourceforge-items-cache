Unlike other tools that analyze raw data, this is designed to evaluate the quality of the processed reads after mapping to a reference genome.\r\nThe evaluation is performed in a genomic region defined by the user, and it provides some statistics computed from the reads that map to that region (ie. a single gene). The program provides a graphical output embedded in an html file. The analysis contains the sequencing quality along the reads, the mapping quality distribution, the coverage of the defined region, the overall quality at each nucleotide position, and the distribution of the coverage as a function of the GC content in the reference genome. The results provided by this program can help to distinguish between sequence variation and sequencing errors.
