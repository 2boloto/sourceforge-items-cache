Using a lightweight C-like syntax, it includes Perry Cook and Gary Scavone's Synthesis Toolkit, as well as advanced and unique signal processing instruments created by Brad Garton, John Gibson, Mara Helmuth and many others.\r\n\r\nRun as a PureData external, RTcmix can be integrated with Pd's great patching and routing functions. It is also easy to distribute as a prepackaged binary, potentially reaching a wider audience.\r\n\r\nThe source is staged at https://github.com/jwmatthys/rtcmix-in-pd\r\n\r\nThis project is based on Brad Garton's rtcmix~ 1.81 for Max/MSP.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rtcmix-pd", "_id": "50518c111be1ce6e09d04fae", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 897951, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "RTcmix music language as PureData external", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
