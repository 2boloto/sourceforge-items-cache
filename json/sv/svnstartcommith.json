E.g. by usage of server side commit hooks to check for minimum acceptance levels on code and documentation quality including commit message structure and content.\r\n\r\nTortoiseSVN offers only a free form text field to edit inside the Commit Dialog. Developers might recall situations when struggling with commit message structure and fighting the server side commit hooks instead of focusing on message content! Thus being annoyed instead of feeling an incentive to deliver high quality descriptions here.\r\n\r\nThe SVNStartCommitHelper is a client side start commit hook script (as a first version written in Python / Tkinter) exactly offering a well-structured form to fill in. The edited content is transformed and forwarded to the SVN commit dialog then. You still have full control on the commit message then.
