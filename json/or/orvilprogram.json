ORganic VIrtual Library (ORVIL) is a perl program to generate a combinatorial library using most frequently observed 200 organic substituents. It is designed to explore the organic chemical space in the given query structure without affecting the entire backbone of the molecule enabling minimum molecular complexities. Its particular features are its simplicity to use, portable SMILES format and high speed of library construction. Benchmarking of Tamoxifen (drug for breast cancer) was performed which revealed a compound having similar architecture of known drug analogue, Toremifene.\r\n\r\nYou can access the abstract and full text article here : http://indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:ijaritac&volume=2&issue=2&article=006", "shortname": "orvilprogram", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "ORganic VIrtual Library (ORVIL)", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 721772}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/orvilprogram/", "video_url": ""}
