These may be added in future. \r\n     This schema was generated by automation taking the SQL BNFs as input. It was then run through schema validators and manually modified further to result in a valid schema.\r\n     The schema was designed such that if an instance document has its tags removed and the order of the content preserved, a valid SQL statement or fragment will be left. \r\n\r\nA JAXB library with javadocs that represent ssqml.xsd are checked into SVN", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ssqml", "_id": "515112d50910d4593470b0dd", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}, {"mount_point": "code-1", "name": "hg", "label": "H++"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1433851, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "A schema to describe ANSI/ISO SQL in XML and associated tools", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Database", "shortname": "database", "fullname": "Database", "id": 66}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Database :: Database Engines/Servers", "shortname": "engines", "fullname": "Database Engines/Servers", "id": 67}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: ORM (Object-relational mapping)", "shortname": "orm", "fullname": "ORM (Object-relational mapping)", "id": 809}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories (DB) :: Project is a database abstraction layer (API)", "shortname": "db_group_api", "fullname": "Project is a database abstraction layer (API)", "id": 510}], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Non-Profit Organizations", "shortname": "nonprofit", "fullname": "Non-Profit Organizations", "id": 618}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Government", "shortname": "government", "fullname": "Government", "id": 569}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Architects", "shortname": "architects", "fullname": "Architects", "id": 863}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
