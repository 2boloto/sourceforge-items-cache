It does a straight copy of files and folders (when the source is newer than the backup) and optionally stores the old backup file versions under a time-stamped folder.  It can also clean the backup by deleting (or optionally moving to a time-stamped folder) files and folders that no longer appear in the source.\r\n\r\nAs an additional feature, the backup can be compared with the source, including a byte-for-byte comparison of all the files.\r\n\r\nAll backup tasks can be specified with a script (see the wiki for details), or by using the GUI.  The backup process can also be paused and resumed.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "ss-backup", "_id": "51ab80e4c431432a6bb850aa", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1839579, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Source"}], "summary": "Lightweight utility for performing backups, with scripting capability", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving", "shortname": "archiving", "fullname": "Archiving", "id": 19}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: System :: Storage :: Archiving :: Backup", "shortname": "backup", "fullname": "Backup", "id": 137}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "shortname": "gplv3", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)", "id": 679}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: Win32 (MS Windows)", "shortname": "win32", "fullname": "Win32 (MS Windows)", "id": 230}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: End Users/Desktop", "shortname": "endusers", "fullname": "End Users/Desktop", "id": 2}], "translation": [{"fullpath": "Translations :: English", "shortname": "english", "fullname": "English", "id": 275}], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
