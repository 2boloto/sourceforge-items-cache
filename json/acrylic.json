What Acrylic does is to reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses as close to zero as possible.\r\n\r\nWith Acrylic you can also gracefully overcome short downtimes of your DNS servers without disrupting your work, because in this case you will at least be able to connect to your favourite sites and to your email server. \r\n\r\nIn addition Acrylic can help you to effectively block unwanted ads prior to their download through the use of a HOSTS file with support for wildcards and regular expressions, optimizing your navigation experience even further.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "acrylic", "developers": [{"url": "http://sourceforge.net/u/mayakron/", "username": "mayakron", "name": "mayakron"}], "external_homepage": "http://mayakron.altervista.org/acrylic.php"}
