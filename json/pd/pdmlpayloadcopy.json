I could find no method in Wireshark to export the data bytes from more than one packet, a online search was also unsuccessful. The UDP packets contained an audio stream in raw PCM format. \r\n\r\nAs a result I have created the pdml payload copy application using VB.Net (V2.0) which stores all the hex data in the .pdml file.to a new file. Using the program I was able to load the raw data file created into Audacity to playback the transmitted audio.\r\n\r\nI have successfully used the application to analyse a .pdml file containing over 20,000 packets (over 300Mb in size). The application can store the byte data for a maximum of 100,000 packets. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 (01/05/14)\r\nThe 'create text file' button allow you to specify a start and end string to match in the pdml file. This will then output a file with all the matched sequences.\r\n\r\n**** Requires VB.Net 2.0 runtime files *****", "shortname": "pdmlpayloadcopy", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Copy payload data from all packets in a wireshark .pdml file", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 888366}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/pdmlpayloadcopy/", "video_url": null}
