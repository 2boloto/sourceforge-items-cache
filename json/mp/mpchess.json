Written in C, using SDL 1.2 or SDL 2 for graphics. Interface inspired from old chess game for ZX Spectrum. The computer searches (L+2)/2 moves ahead (assuming that a move means that both sides move a piece), where L is the difficulty level. Positions are evaluated only by adding the values of the pieces left on the board. Any factors related to where the pieces are, such as mobility, doubled pawns, isolated pawns etc. are not considered. To add variety to the game, possible moves are randomly shuffled before every search.", "shortname": "mpchess", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Simple chess game written in C", "tools": [{"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1902288}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/mpchess/", "video_url": ""}
