This program generates a script (.bat, sh) with calls to the (free) ffmpeg program that will, in turn, cut the MP3 file. You only need to supply a text file with the information (artist, album, songs with durations or start/end times).\r\n\r\nThe text file itself is simple. First line: artist. Second line: album. Following lines: the songs (titles and durations). Songs format is quite open and flexible; just throw the titles and the durations (or start times) and the program will try to figure out what to do.
