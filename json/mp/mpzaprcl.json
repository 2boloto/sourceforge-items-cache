It is a conversion of the Java based APRT-CLE written by Dario Alpern, who had written his based on the UBASIC version from Yuji Kida.  This version incorporates improvements based on Jason Moxham's APR-CL code, which greatly reduced run-time memory requirements.\r\n\r\nmpz_aprcl is meant to be compiled on systems that support C, GMP, and a 64-bit data type.  It can prove the primality of numbers up to 6021 digits long.\r\n\r\nmpz_aprcl32 is meant to be compiled on systems that support C, GMP, a 32-bit data type, but no 64-bit data type.  This project can prove the primality of numbers up to 3827 digits long.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 was posted on 2013/12/27.  This new version is around 1.5-2.2x faster and has some bug fixes.
