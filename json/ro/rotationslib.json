The rotation representations that are supported are rotation matrices (Rotmat), Quaternions (Quat), intrinsic ZYX Euler angles (Euler), fused angles (Fused) and tilt angles (Tilt). Operations such as composition, inversion, ZYX yaw extraction, fused yaw extraction, random generation, equality detection, vector rotation and much more have been implemented for each rotation representation. Unit tests for each function are provided to ensure that the library is performant.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rotationslib", "_id": "54590f8cd46bb40bf29b9189", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2357172, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Library for working with 3D rotations in Matlab/Octave", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering", "shortname": "scientific", "fullname": "Scientific/Engineering", "id": 97}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Robotics", "shortname": "robotics", "fullname": "Robotics", "id": 602}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries", "shortname": "softdevlibraries", "fullname": "Libraries", "id": 770}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: MATLAB", "shortname": "matlab", "fullname": "MATLAB", "id": 626}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "shortname": "os_portable", "fullname": "OS Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)", "id": 436}]}}
