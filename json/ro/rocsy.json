The pH scale and thermodynamic equilibrium constants used in rocsy are those recommended by Best-Practices Guide (Dickson et al., 2007). Also included are options to use more recent formulations for K1 and K2 from Millero (2010) and for total boron from Lee et al. (2010). \r\n\r\nThe rocsy package is designed for users with some programming experience, preferably in Fortran or python. Others may well prefer the facility of packages such as the Excel version of CO2sys.  But rocsy is computationally much faster, being designed for big data sets and ocean models. For models, rocsy offers improved accuracy by avoiding 3 common approximations. Computed variables generally agree with those from CO2sys within 0.005% (Orr and Epitalon, 2013).", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rocsy", "_id": "51a59fa881b24b19e2ea9f56", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1817017, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Routines for the ocean carbonate system", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
