The classic \"Rodney\" as described in David L. Heisermann's book \"How to build your own self-programming robot\", with the original Intel 8085 code.  In all likelihood, this is for reference only. I don't expect many people are going to build it\r\n\r\n2.  An updated version, running on more modern hardware, but remaining true to the algorithms published in his book.\r\n\r\nThe end result will be at least three sets of code, for the Alpha, Beta and Gamma versions of Rodney.  We would also like to experiment with a \"Delta\" version which could use either bare RF or WiFi to exchange state data between machines.  A \"hive mind\" if you like.\r\n\r\nFor the new-generation version, we propose targeting two hardware platforms:\r\n\r\n1.  Arduino, since it's cheap and easy to use, while remaining close to the bare metal\r\n\r\n2.  A purpose-built AVR card, or easily ported to cards obtainable from sources such as futurlec.com, etc.\r\n\r\nRaspberryPi is also an option later", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rodneyspr", "_id": "5186cf0dea406b0e4290029d", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1739157, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Re-imagining of Heisermann's classic Self-Programming Robot", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Algorithms", "shortname": "algorithms", "fullname": "Algorithms", "id": 620}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Robotics", "shortname": "robotics", "fullname": "Robotics", "id": 602}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "id": 133}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Assembly", "shortname": "assembly", "fullname": "Assembly", "id": 162}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: BSD License", "shortname": "bsd", "fullname": "BSD License", "id": 187}], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Non-interactive (Daemon)", "shortname": "daemon", "fullname": "Non-interactive (Daemon)", "id": 238}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Information Technology", "shortname": "informationtechnology", "fullname": "Information Technology", "id": 363}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Other Operating Systems :: Other", "shortname": "other", "fullname": "Other", "id": 212}]}}
