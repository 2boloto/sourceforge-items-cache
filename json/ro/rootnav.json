Semi-automated reconstruction makes the analysis of many images extremely quick and straightforward. Root data can be exported, and then analysed in bulk using the supplied viewer tool.\r\n\r\nRootNav v1.8.1 This update contains a single bug fix for a nasty exception that was crashing RootNav occasionally.\r\n\r\nRootNav v1.8. A new feature has been added allowing custom labels on each root. On the tree view at the measurement stage, you can type a custom field into each appropriate box and these will be stored in RSML format alongside each root. This might be useful for distinguishing between different types of primary root, or adding custom information to refer to later.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about bug fixes and the version you are running, please feel free to email me.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rootnav", "_id": "50698b741be1ce5db181c6e5", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 989854, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "hg", "label": "Code"}], "summary": "Software for the reconstruction of complex root architectures", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
