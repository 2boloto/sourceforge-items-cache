It also includes a powerful distributed file system designed to ensure that the analytics workloads can locally access the data to be processed to minimize the network bandwidth impact.\r\n\r\nI found this filesystem very useful to leverage storage from all my PCs and even from some of my online storage such as S3. However i did not want to deploy the full hadoop stack. Hence my decidion to create a standalone distribution from the 0.20.2 branch (the base one used for 1.0.0).\r\n\r\nThe idea is very simple : create a lightweight distribution of the Hadoop Namenode and Datanode for both Linux and Windows which does not require Cygwin for that latter operating system. The goal is to have a central Namenode on Linux and to create an online storage cloud with Linux and Windows Datanodes.\r\n\r\nI also included few enhancements such as a WebDav server and an Ajax WebDAV explorer.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "standalonehdfs", "_id": "5106ef2c1be1ce32f91127f8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1259964, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
