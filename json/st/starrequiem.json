Mankind has all but given up their warlike ways, instead following a destiny of peace, exploration, and discovery.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the year 1044 A.E. (After Exodus), the cyborg race Xyl discovered humanity, and proceeded to systematically begin the process of what they had done to every other species in their quadrant - exterminate them to the last microbe.\r\n\r\nYour mission as the human supreme commander in this exciting solitaire game is fourfold: First, rebuild and retool the peaceful human economy and set it on a war footing. Second, develop and build mighty starships of war to bring the fight to the Xyl. Third, develop new technologies that could turn the titide of the war.. or turn out to be worthless dead-ends. And finally, destroy the 4 Flagships of the 4 Grand Fleets, or if you are bold (or desperate) enough, send an fleet to destroy the AI Core.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "starrequiem", "_id": "50c657551be1ce6a7f127703", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1166323, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "An indie space strategy game - it's a game of human survival.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Turn Based Strategy", "shortname": "turnbasedstrategy", "fullname": "Turn Based Strategy", "id": 83}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Visual Basic .NET", "shortname": "vb_net", "fullname": "Visual Basic .NET", "id": 453}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "shortname": "mswin_all32bit", "fullname": "All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP)", "id": 435}]}}
