Studies on how the noise enters and propagates in biochemical systems provided us with nontrivial insights into the origins of stochasticity, in total however they constitute a patchwork of different theoretical analyses. Here we present a flexible and generally applicable noise decomposition tool, that allows us to calculate contributions of individual reactions to the total variability of a system\u2019s output. With the package it is therefore possible to quantify how the noise enters and propagates in biochemical systems. We also demonstrate and exemplify using the JAK-STAT signalling pathway that it is possible to infer noise contributions resulting from individual reactions directly from experimental data. This is the first computational tool that allows to decompose noise into contributions resulting from individual reactions.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "stochdecomp", "_id": "51bacfb504161f2c1c1298f4", "tools": [{"sourceforge_group_id": 1877180, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "User Manual describing theory behind the package, installation instruc", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable", "shortname": "production", "fullname": "5 - Production/Stable", "id": 11}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Molecular Science", "shortname": "molecular_science", "fullname": "Molecular Science", "id": 609}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics", "shortname": "bioinformatics", "fullname": "Bio-Informatics", "id": 252}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics :: Statistics", "shortname": "statistics", "fullname": "Statistics", "id": 826}], "language": [], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
