The code is natively executed by the cpu \r\nwhere the simulation is run. The time annotation engine annotates the C source \r\ncode used for simulation with the timing information as if the code is run on a \r\nmicrocontroller. The annotation process is fully automated.\r\n\r\nHardware models are developed using the PAWiS framework and reflect the timing, \r\nfunctionality, and energy-consumption of real-world hardware such as a CC2420 \r\nradio transceiver.\r\n\r\nNetwork behavior in terms of wireless channel models are provided by the PAWiS \r\nand the MiXiM framework.\r\n\r\nSTEAM-Sim is an extension to the PAWiS and MiXiM framework. The underlying \r\nsimulator is OMNeT++. Please see the corresponding documentation.\r\n\r\nI also ported the Contiki v2.6 operating system to STEAM-Sim, thus it is possible \r\nto run Contiki-based code in the simulation.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "steamsim", "_id": "55311f61b9363c1398e4ec08", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2447108, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}], "summary": "An accurate, scalable, and energy-aware simulator for WSNs", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 4 - Beta", "shortname": "beta", "fullname": "4 - Beta", "id": 10}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Simulations", "shortname": "simulations", "fullname": "Simulations", "id": 600}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C", "shortname": "c", "fullname": "C", "id": 164}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "shortname": "lgpl", "fullname": "GNU Library or Lesser General Public License version 2.0 (LGPLv2)", "id": 16}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Engineering", "shortname": "audienceengineering", "fullname": "Engineering", "id": 729}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}]}}
