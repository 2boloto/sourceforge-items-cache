It includes initialization routines, all functionality included in the Arduino libraries, and some additional functionality. It also includes several fonts that can be used.\r\n\r\nOptimizations have been made to the libraries to allow better performance. Instead of redrawing the entire screen when an update happens, only the part of the screen that was changed is updated.\r\n\r\nThis library is for the Version 1 TFT board. It uses an 8-bit data connection. It also uses straight GPIO lines, not DMA, to control the TFT. This means performance is slow, but also leaves the code flexible for easy porting to other STM32 platforms, or even non-STM platforms.\r\n\r\nAny contributions to these libs are welcome. I will be updating this library regularly with more functionality and better performance, including the ability to configure use with DMA.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "stm32f4discover", "_id": "517597fb3e5e835d9e0ffe11", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1638062, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Library to enable Arduino TFT on STM32F4 Discovery board", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
