However, Most previous coding potential prediction methods heavily rely on alignment, either pairwise alignment to search for protein evidence or multiple alignments to calculate phylogenetic conservation score (such as CPC , PhyloCSF and RNACode ). This is because most previously identified transcripts including protein coding RNA and short, housekeeping/regulatory RNAs such as snRNAs, snoRNA and tRNA are highly conserved. While still very useful, these approaches have several limitations:\r\n\r\n    Most lncRNAs are less conserved and tend to be lineage specific which greatly limit the discrimination power of alignment-based methods. For example, of 550 lncRNAs detected from zebrafish, only 29 of them had detectable sequence", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rna-cpat", "_id": "51dc4ec80910d410aca5f8ce", "tools": [{"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1894916, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}], "summary": "RNA coding potential assessment tool", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
