It will take the some base classes (from .net 2.0) and add to them. It will also add some extra components and methods to existing classes and add new classes to them. It is developed within monodevelop so it will run on any windows based pc from xp(2000) and also it will run easily on most major linux distributions (developed on ubuntu as it comes natively with mono).\r\n\r\nThe main idea is to make .net accessible to everyone with an entry level (beginner) version to make it easy to start with and a higher level (advanced) version available for those that want to access everything on offer with open net-extra.\r\n\r\nThe secondary idea is that this open source version will allow users to add their own classes and even branch off from this in an entirely new direction and approach enhancing the choice available.\r\n", "shortname": "open-net-extra", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "makes .net easy", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 658160}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/open-net-extra/", "video_url": ""}
