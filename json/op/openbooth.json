OpenBooth simplifies the process of making meal orders at a restaurant and minimizes the need for a significant number of wait staff. The system will also ensure that sales data is actively recorded, easily accessible and accurate. Customers would not need to wait for wait staff to become available to take their orders but would instead be able to promptly place the orders themselves. Since the system records and manages orders electronically, it becomes easy to generate statistics as needed.", "shortname": "openbooth", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1101192}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/openbooth/", "video_url": ""}
