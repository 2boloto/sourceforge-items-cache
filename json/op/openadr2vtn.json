OpenADR defines a machine-to-machine interface and includes the information model, transport and security mechanisms, and the manner in which data is exchanged between two end points. OpenADR 2.0 defines what and how information is communicated between an electricity service provider and customers, but it does not purport to define how either end point uses the information. This VTN application is one example of how the OpenADR 2.0 specification can be applied. It includes a graphical user interface used to set up user accounts, assign clients (virtual end nodes, or VENs), define resources, market contexts, and create and schedule demand response events.\r\n\r\nThis application and source code is designed to work with OpenADR clients (VENs).
