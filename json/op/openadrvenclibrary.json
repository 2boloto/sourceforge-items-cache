OpenADR is a machine-to-machine interface that defines the information model, transport and security mechanisms, and the manner in which data is exchanged between two end points. OpenADR 2.0 is an open specification that defines how information is communicated between an electricity service provider and customers, but it does not purport to define how either end point uses the information. This VEN library is one example of how the specification can be applied. This open source library, written in C++, was developed as a library designed to provide users with a toolkit for the OpenADR 2.0b interface, its information model, XML payloads, interactions with a VTN, and many other uses.
