The HTTP scan type is highly configurable and best illustrates the power and utility behind this product.\r\n\r\nOpCheck's most powerful feature is the HTTP scan type.  It checks the availability, performance, and configuration of web applications.  It contains an extremely powerful HTTP request crafter that allows you to send any payload to the target web server - any combination of headers, cookies, and message body.
