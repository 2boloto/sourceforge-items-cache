Models can be uploaded by the users and also can be connected to other models in order to simulate them in a row.\r\n\r\nThese simulations are stored and can be reviewed or deleted at anytime. The Graphical Visualization Environment (GVE) provides the graphical visualization of the simulation results. Results can also be exported to different formats (xls, txt or csv).\r\n\r\nThis simulation environment is built using Spring Framework and Java technologies.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how to deploy and use the tool, check the installation and user manuals.\r\n\r\nThis tool was developed within the Synergy project. You can view our publication about the Simulation Environment here: http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/12/S2/S7\r\n\r\nThe rest of the publication outcomes of the project can be found here: http://www.translational-medicine.com/supplements/12/S2", "shortname": "openhealthpractice", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A simulation environment for physiology models simulation", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2193330}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/openhealthpractice/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/dZQO8qRYMac?rel=0"}
