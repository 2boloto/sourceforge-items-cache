I already investigated and used e.g. several programs to pray the Rosary on Android and Windows. I appreciate everyone who is doing something in this area, especially, if he provides the results for free. Anyhow, I am thinking that this software somehow lacks the flexibility to modify the prayers, meditations etc. that come along with it. \r\n\r\nWhat I am planning to do with this project is to not create just another software for praying the Rosary, but to define first of all a general data-Format for the storage of Rosary or as I call it beads-based prayers. An example for another beads-based prayer is the Jesus Prayer which is used within the eastern-orthodox tradition. \r\n\r\nThen it should be possible to create different softwares for different purposes onto different platforms like e.g. Google Android, Windows, HTML5 \r\n", "shortname": "openrosary", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A Project for creation of a flexible beads-based Prayer-Software.", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 859488}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/openrosary/", "video_url": ""}
