OpenCrowbar enables upgrade and continuous deployment automation. This capability is important for large scale deployments of evolving complex projects like OpenStack, Hadoop, and Ceph.\r\n\r\nOpenCrowbar provides the foundation for operations automation. OpenCrowbar is an open reference implementation that can be reliably deployed in large-scale, multi-site datacenters. This effectively productizes best practices in a way that allows creation of consistent and discoverable operating environments. Users benefit with fast time-to-value and we benefit by having consistent installations across the ecosystem.", "shortname": "opencrowbar", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Data Center Bare Metal configuration platform", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2377947}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/opencrowbar/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/ajQnD0az0yQ?rel=0"}
