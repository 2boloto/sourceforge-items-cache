It is applicable to the campus wide network and is compatible to almost all network terminals.   We have been developing a Web-based authentication system 'Opengate'(http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengateproject).  But recently, network terminals are evolving and increasing.  Some terminals require always network connection. Some do not support smooth keyboard typing. Thus, we start to develop the system more applicable to the environments.  This system checks the packet at the gateway, and opens the firewall when the source MAC address is found in the database, where allowable MAC addresses and the owners are registered.  It is suited for campus network environment where various users bring in various terminals.  It is not suited for the network environment needing high security. If external conditions are prepared, it is recommend to replace the system with a more secure system.", "shortname": "opengatem", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}], "status": "active", "summary": "A MAC address based user authentication system for campus-wide network", "tools": [{"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 1468067}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/opengatem/", "video_url": ""}
