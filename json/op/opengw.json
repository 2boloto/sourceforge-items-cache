Unfortunately in 2011 Activision shut down the creator and developer of the game, Bizarre Creations.\r\n\r\nAs a software engineer and game programmer I set out to create something that could be used as a basis for a custom-built arcade cabinet. Something that was true to GW:RE but added the multiplayer aspect of GW2. \r\n\r\nInspired by the Wii version of Geometry Wars I experimented with support for some pretty crazy custom-shaped levels with holes in them etc, but ultimately decided to stick true to GW:RE.
