Using batteries as energy source with low power hardware components\r\nenables both user mobility and safety. A new modular spring loaded fNIRS instrumentation\r\napproach allows direct application and fixation of the fNIRS measurement module to the head.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the system concept, hardware, software and mechanical implementation of\r\nthe instrument are explicated and files are made avaliable for personal and scientific use.", "shortname": "opennirs", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "openNIRS: An open source functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy device.", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2296600}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/opennirs/", "video_url": null}
