The current version only implements the 16-bit part (real mode). The processor is a pipelined architecture clocked at 100 MHz in a Cyclone II speed grade -6. Therefore it can be seen as similar to a 486 in real mode.\r\n\r\nSeveral peripherals are also implemented in a somewhat minimalistic way, but enough to be able to boot an IBM PCXT compatible bios and MSDOS 6.22. The current implementation is only proven to boot the bios and DOS in simulation. The system is targeted to run on the DE2-70 board. In order to run the system in hardware a SDRAM and SRAM controller need to be added. These are currently in development.\r\n", "shortname": "opensoc86", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Open implementation of the x86 architecture", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2324472}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/opensoc86/", "video_url": null}
