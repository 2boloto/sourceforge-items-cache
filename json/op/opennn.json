It is based on the most popular neural network model, the multilayer perceptron.\r\n\r\nThe package deploys data mining methods contained in a bundle of classes. These can be embedded in other software tools using an application programming interface (API) for the interaction between the software tool and the predictive analytics tasks.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of OpenNN is its high performance. This library outstands in terms of execution speed and memory allocation. It is constantly optimized and parallelized in order to maximize its efficiency.\r\n\r\nSome typical applications of OpenNN are function regression (modelling), pattern recognition (classification) and time series prediction (forecasting). \r\n\r\nThe documentation is composed by tutorials and examples to offer a complete overview about the library.\r\n\r\nOpenNN is developed by Intelnics, a company specialized in artificial intelligence.
