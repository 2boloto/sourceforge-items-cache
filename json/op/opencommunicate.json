This is done by utilizing a software product line, a knowledge-based system and use of S-expressions of Lisp, so anybody can add new languages of choice and reuse artifcats written in these languages. Also native code is supported this way, using LLVM.\r\n\r\n2) Give the user a real generic solution at hand to manage the maintenance of industrial automation software. Especially these means a generic solution to dynamic reconfiguration demands. This is solved by the true generic character of Lisp and incorporating well-know statecharts of a HSM.", "shortname": "opencommunicate", "socialnetworks": [], "status": "active", "summary": "A generic communication framework", "tools": [{"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 356981}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/opencommunicate/", "video_url": ""}
