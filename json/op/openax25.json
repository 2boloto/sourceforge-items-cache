It can route all AX.25 traffic from one interface to another. The main purpose is HAMNET / Packet Radio interoperation.\r\n\r\nBoth AX.25 V 2.0 and V2.2 protocol is implemented. The program can be configured with a XML file and is based on a very flexible plugin design. You can start the program in a small GUI or as a server process with the same configuration file. \r\n\r\nThe chosen platform is CLI (.NET) to allow interoperation among all major operating systems (Windows, Linux and the Mac).\r\n\r\nCooperators and testers will be greatly appreciated.
