Sokolova is most likely a Slavic name and a female name)\r\n- some names are very rare or just 'made up' and yet, because they sound like a male name or a female name, their gender is accurately perceived by the people in that same culture\r\nGendRE API goal is to hide this complexity, offer a simple interface and return an optimal result.", "shortname": "onomastics", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "gendreapp", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gendre/1409111909355019", "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "Extract Gender from Personal Names", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2261345}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Blog", "mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog"}, {"label": "Rapid Miner", "mount_point": "rapidminer", "name": "link"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/onomastics/", "video_url": "www.youtube.com/embed/wScgijiqA2c?rel=0"}
