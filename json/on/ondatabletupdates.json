Typically .rar files with .img.  These are Onda proprietary.  The Windows utility OndaSuite is normally included.  It flashes the new firmware (Rom) code.  Linux users can use LiveSuite instead of OndaSuite.  I had a very difficult time getting update file for my Onda V801.  Downloads from Baidu always timed out.  Thus the reason for this project.  Feel free to email me with links to other hard to download or hard to find updates for Onda tablets.  They are a great value and very well made, worth the hassle of little English language support.
