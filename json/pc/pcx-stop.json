All CP sites will be forced to use CP*.*.* domains or face severe and expensive commercial repercussions by liens being applied and levied against non-compliant persons. This small change will allow for tools that can easily detect and filter out such websites, thereby making the Internet safer for children. The commercial processes I can handle on my own, as that's my thing, but I will require help with code to help find and track offenders.  This project will make money through the liens that are levied against those who do not comply; I take 50% and the other 50% is for the coders who help me to accomplish this righteous undertaking.\r\n\r\nPlease join if you think you may be able to help.
