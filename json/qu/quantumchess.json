Instead Quantum Chess models each piece as a wave function between other pieces on the board allowing the discovery of optimal continuous paths.  Please see the discussion page on where to begin.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical advantage of Quantum Chess is that it automatically prunes redundant moves unlike iterative/branching models while maintaining strategy-like behavior completely unlike both chess AIs and humans. \r\n\r\nIt is intended as an experiment to play against itself, and later to interface to other computers and humans.  This should help form the basis for understanding real-world problems in a completely different way.\r\n\r\nLet this be an experiment into how we think about objects and waves as much as a viable ai chess alternative.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "quantumchess", "_id": "509197bb7929e5435370af53", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1055435, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "Discovers optimal chess moves from quantum-like wave-functions", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Console-based Games", "shortname": "console-games", "fullname": "Console-based Games", "id": 633}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment :: Game development framework", "shortname": "gameframeworks", "fullname": "Game development framework", "id": 794}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: C++", "shortname": "cpp", "fullname": "C++", "id": 165}], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [{"fullpath": "User Interface :: Graphical :: OpenGL", "shortname": "ui_opengl", "fullname": "OpenGL", "id": 475}], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Advanced End Users", "shortname": "enduser_advanced", "fullname": "Advanced End Users", "id": 536}, {"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "shortname": "mingw_msys", "fullname": "MinGW/MSYS (MS Windows)", "id": 445}]}}
