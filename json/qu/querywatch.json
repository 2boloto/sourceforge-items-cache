Unfortunately I was not able to find the last version that I submitted to my university, so this version has quite a few issues. \r\nThe main objective of this project is to narrow the gap between agnostic computer users and databases. It involves creating a graphical user interface with the help of which a user can navigate inside a database or create SQL queries without knowing any SQL, and see the results of these queries.\r\nThere is a lot of work to be done on this project; I have't touched this code for about a year, so I am just uploading it and gonna start reviewing it and trying to come up with a list of things to do.
