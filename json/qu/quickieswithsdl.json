I'm working on this in my spare spare time, so it might take forever.\r\n\r\nThis is just for fun and, at the moment, for personal reference only. However, if you find anything useful or interesting amongst the old junk, I'd really appreciate it, if you would drop me a note in the forum/discussion.
