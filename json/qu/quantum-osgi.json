Modules such as User, Accounts, Products, CMS, Security, Financial Gateway etc.  Each providing there own domain models and services to allow for an application to be composed rather than developed.  \r\n\r\nThe framework consists of core APIs and utilities, as well a integration, persistence and web/UI services.  Modules will be assembled and extended, allowing for any kind of application to be created.  Why constantly recreate the same code for each application?  With modular style development the services can be reused and refined to perfection within the open source community.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "quantum-osgi", "_id": "5110f96a24b0d919b0c4820e", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "code-0", "name": "svn", "label": "Code"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1270786, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "An OSGi application framework for modular development.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha", "shortname": "prealpha", "fullname": "2 - Pre-Alpha", "id": 8}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Software Development :: Frameworks", "shortname": "frameworks", "fullname": "Frameworks", "id": 606}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: Apache License V2.0", "shortname": "apache2", "fullname": "Apache License V2.0", "id": 401}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: Other network-based DBMS", "shortname": "db_net_other", "fullname": "Other network-based DBMS", "id": 533}], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Developers", "shortname": "developers", "fullname": "Developers", "id": 3}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
