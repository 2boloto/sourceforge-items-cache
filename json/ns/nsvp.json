Elastic and flexible. It is is able to customize CPU, RAM, network and local storage on servers - up and down, on the fly.\r\n3.It can clone virtual firewall, virtual IPS etc to create 'customer images' which can be used to deploy copies of a server configuration\r\n4.IAble to Import and Export server images, allowing you to transfer virtual machines to and from your own infrastructure\r\n5.Fully scalable, host many network security solutions in a virtualized environment without sacrificing the performance.\r\n6.It has centralized management console.\r\n7.It is only used to host virtual network security solutions such as firewall, IPS,Antivirus etc.\r\n8.
