It enables one to quickly and cheaply create dynamic compute clusters in the cloud, which can then run computational pipelines generically. It is also able to optimize the use of spot instances - idle computers in Amazon's cloud that are available at drastically reduced cost (5x-10x cheaper) - but can be terminated at any moment if capacity drops or the bid price rises. It also provides pre-installed features such as GlusterFS distributed filesystems, ThunderstormDistributor queuing system, RAID 0 /scratch, password-less ssh, and automatic cluster management, for ease of use and maximum processing speed for computational tools.
