Have you ever imagined losing your personal emails from your Inbox? It's like losing your very own letters from your wallet or purse. You feel lost, when you face kind of data loss, on personal as well as official front. Through the e-mails we not only express our personal, but professional view as well. We feel interconnected on an email network and in case of loss or damage, we feel disconnected or deprived. \r\n\r\nWhile working on the Outlook email platform, we have to work with OST files. The OST stands for Offline Storage Table, which supports MS Outlook, while the PST stands for Personal Storage Table, which supports the Exchange email platform. When we shift from one platform to the other, then we need to carry our data too. In such conditions, if we have conversion software, then we will not lose emails at all. Otherwise, we can lose data in personal or professional use.", "shortname": "osttopst", "socialnetworks": [{"accounturl": "", "socialnetwork": "Twitter"}, {"accounturl": null, "socialnetwork": "Facebook"}], "status": "active", "summary": "", "tools": [{"label": "Activity", "mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity"}, {"label": "Files", "mount_point": "files", "name": "files"}, {"label": "Summary", "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "sourceforge_group_id": 2171203}, {"label": "Reviews", "mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews"}, {"label": "Support", "mount_point": "support", "name": "support"}, {"label": "Wiki", "mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki"}, {"label": "Code", "mount_point": "code", "name": "git"}, {"label": "Tickets", "mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets"}, {"label": "Discussion", "mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion"}], "url": "http://sourceforge.net/p/osttopst/", "video_url": null}
