Using game design techniques people practise or learn new skills or become aware of unknown problems and solutions. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of the OSMA project is  to reduce the cost barrier for the development of these serious games. To achieve this we look for generic, extensible and reusable components within the three pillars of game development: game technology, game art and game design. \r\n\r\nThe OSMA serious game engine is the core of the project. This engine is built up from existing opensource technology components. \r\n\r\nThis engine is extended with game environments, objects and characters that can be used in different game contexts and for different audiences. Therefore a universal style manual is developed that is the basis of the various game assets.
