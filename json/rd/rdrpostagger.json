For the Vietnamese POS tagging, RDRPOSTagger has reached an up-to-date highest tagging accuracy on the Vietnamese Treebank corpus  and also achieved 1st place at the VLSP 2013 POS tagging task. \r\nIn addition to English and Vietnamese, RDRPOSTagger now supports the pre-trained POS and morphological tagging models to 13 languages including Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Lao, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Thai.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rdrpostagger", "_id": "5272189204161f604a11c142", "tools": [{"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1995314, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}], "summary": "A Rule-based Part-of-Speech and Morphological Tagging Toolkit", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence", "shortname": "ai", "fullname": "Artificial Intelligence", "id": 133}, {"fullpath": "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering :: Information Analysis", "shortname": "informationanalysis", "fullname": "Information Analysis", "id": 385}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}, {"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Java", "shortname": "java", "fullname": "Java", "id": 198}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: OSI-Approved Open Source :: GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "shortname": "gpl", "fullname": "GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)", "id": 15}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Science/Research", "shortname": "scienceresearch", "fullname": "Science/Research", "id": 367}], "translation": [], "os": []}}
