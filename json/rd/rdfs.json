Now an open-sourced distributed file system named Raid Distributed File System (RDFS) is published by researchers in National University of Defense Technology. RDFS is a POSIX-compatible cloud storage system that achieves high availability through erasure codes. RDFS can replace the HDFS file system in the Hadoop system. The novel feature is its highly-efficient data repairs for multiple simultaneous failures that recover lost data based on the topology-aware tree structured reconstruction. RDFS permits a wide classes of coding algorithms for the repairing purposes. Further, this system optimizes the coding operations through adaptively parallel threads.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rdfs", "_id": "539efbe685540d71a8da39f8", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2260564, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}], "summary": "RDFS: an erasure code based cloud storage system", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
