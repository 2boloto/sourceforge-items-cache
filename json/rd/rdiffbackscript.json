Rdiff-backup is working on block level, so multiple generations are really small in size.\r\n\r\nIts also possible (not mandatory) to schedule the script multiple times per day, but it will backup only once. This is helpfull when the remote hosts are not available all the time. \r\n\r\nWhen backing up to a remote Windows machine, no client software is needed, everything works over Samba (loop mounted ext). On remote Linux/Unix hosts it will require rdiff-backup.\r\n\r\nThe script can send an email notification when it completes. It can also send warnings when the disk capacity is reaching limits. \r\n\r\nIts possible to create password protected archives which contain i.e. /etc folder.\r\n\r\nThe script will only support 1 Windows host and 1 Unix/Linux host as backup storage. Its pushing data to other hosts, not pulling like other backup software.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "rdiffbackscript", "_id": "511f8d80f1fd8d6accfea4b3", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1283083, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}], "summary": "Backup script for rdiff-backup which pushes data to network targets", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
