PySioGame focuses mainly on teaching maths but it also covers areas such as abc, reading, writing, colors, memory and more. Children as young as 3 can start playing with some of the activities.\r\n\r\nBuilding this project itself is author's learning tool in stepping into hobbyist programming world so it isn't polished as well as you would expect from commercial games, but hey, it's only one amateur, self taught person coding it in his scarce spare time.\r\n\r\nFor voice functionality please also install eSpeak - https://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/\r\n\r\nIn order to run this program on Linux you need python-pygame package installed.\r\n\r\nIs there anything you would do differently, anything missing, any bugs or unexpected behaviour? Any ideas for improvement?
