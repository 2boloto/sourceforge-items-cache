This class is designed to behave exactly as a standard Fraction would except that 1) it supports string constructions of mixed number fractions, 2) it supports three argument construction in the form of whole_number,numerator, denominator, and 3) the string representation is formatted in mixed number form.  All the methods and properties behave the same (except as noted above) with the addition of a fnumerator property which returns the numerator of the fractional portion of the number only and the addition of a whole property which behaves as a % 1 to return only the whole number portion of the number.
