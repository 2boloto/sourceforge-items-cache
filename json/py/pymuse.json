It was written in Python and organically combined the multi algorithms including the evolutionary algorithm, the simulated annealing algorithm and the basin hopping algorithm to collaboratively search the global energy minimum of materials with the fixed stoichiometry. After introduced the competition in all the evolutionary and variation operators, the evolution of the crystal population and the choice of the operators are self-adaptive automatically, i.e. the crystal population undergoes the self-adaptive evolution process. So, it can very effectively predict the material's stable and metastable structures under certain conditions only provided the chemical information of the material. Its success rate is almost 100%.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "pymuse", "_id": "50fe63a87929e57685ce614a", "tools": [{"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 1250490, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "mailman", "name": "mailman", "label": "Mailing Lists"}], "summary": "A Multi-algorithm Collaborative Structure-prediction Environment", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
