Though the programmer has tp build his own GUI, for which he has complete freedom as it only calculates for you, not builds something for you.\r\n\r\nThough, for a programmer's convenience, PyProgbar can be Dependant. But its Core files will stay cross-platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: suppose you are building an app for windows. and will be using GUI which is Windows dependant.\r\nAnd you want to port it to MeeGo or Symbian. It will be wholly different.\r\n\r\nBut, except GUI. Nothing needs to be re-written. Like the progress bar. Its target is mostly entry level programmers longing for writing something interactive but in 'less lines'. Also, a professional programmer can take its advantage for time efficiency. Thats my view\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading. :)", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "pyprogbar", "_id": "505f5c2db9363c7ddcf3979b", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "code", "name": "git", "label": "Code"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 973627, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "PyProgBar is a purely python implemented cross platform progressbar.", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [], "topic": [], "language": [], "license": [], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [], "translation": [], "os": []}}
