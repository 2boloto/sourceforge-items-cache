I have switched to Lua/LOVE as my language of choice, and am working on porting Pylot to Lua.\r\n\r\nPylot is a multi-stage project to build a complex 2D spaceflight game in Python, inspired by Asteroids, XPilot, and Luola. The first stage of the project, which has been completed, is to create a clone of Asteroids - with a few improvements on the original gameplay. The second stage is to develop the game into a clone of XPilot, and will include client-server multiplayer. The third stage is to incorporate elements from other games, such as the little-known cave-flyer called Luola, including destructible terrain, circular gravity sources and EVAs.", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "pylotgame", "_id": "506f61430594ca4ddb3068c7", "tools": [{"mount_point": "downloads", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "wiki", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 998259, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}], "summary": "2D space game with semi-realistic physics", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Games/Entertainment", "shortname": "games", "fullname": "Games/Entertainment", "id": 80}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License", "shortname": "ccal", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution License", "id": 868}], "database": [], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by End-User Class :: Testers", "shortname": "testers", "fullname": "Testers", "id": 865}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}]}}
