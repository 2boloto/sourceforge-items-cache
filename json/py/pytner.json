That means, you can enable the software to generate audio files of the words you did not know. I found this very effective, because I could use the dead time (waiting for bus/train) or before getting to sleep, and listen to the audio files of the new words. The audio files for each day won't be more than some minutes = not boring!!\r\n\r\nA sample study plan could be like this:\r\n- enter some new words everyday (10-15)\r\n- work with the software 5-10 min a day and just click if you can remember the meaning or not.\r\n- copy the audio files in your device and listen to them (less than 10 min) in the daily dead time.\r\n\r\nFor a tutorial, please check the Wiki.\r\nEnjoy", "moved_to_url": "", "shortname": "pytner", "_id": "53f280edf1fd8d1f4e5cfaaf", "tools": [{"mount_point": "activity", "name": "activity", "label": "Activity"}, {"mount_point": "discussion", "name": "discussion", "label": "Discussion"}, {"mount_point": "svn", "name": "svn", "label": "SVN"}, {"mount_point": "tickets", "name": "tickets", "label": "Tickets"}, {"mount_point": "pytner", "name": "wiki", "label": "Wiki"}, {"mount_point": "support", "name": "support", "label": "Support"}, {"mount_point": "reviews", "name": "reviews", "label": "Reviews"}, {"sourceforge_group_id": 2307614, "mount_point": "summary", "name": "summary", "label": "Summary"}, {"mount_point": "files", "name": "files", "label": "Files"}, {"mount_point": "blog", "name": "blog", "label": "Blog"}, {"mount_point": "git", "name": "git", "label": "Git"}], "summary": "Leitner flash card system based on Python", "categories": {"developmentstatus": [{"fullpath": "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha", "shortname": "alpha", "fullname": "3 - Alpha", "id": 9}], "topic": [{"fullpath": "Topic :: Education :: Languages", "shortname": "edlanguage", "fullname": "Languages", "id": 859}], "language": [{"fullpath": "Programming Language :: Python", "shortname": "python", "fullname": "Python", "id": 178}], "license": [{"fullpath": "License :: Creative Commons Attribution License :: Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0", "shortname": "ccanclv2", "fullname": "Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License V2.0", "id": 871}], "database": [{"fullpath": "Database Environment :: Network-based DBMS :: SQLite", "shortname": "db_net_sqlite", "fullname": "SQLite", "id": 531}], "environment": [], "audience": [{"fullpath": "Intended Audience :: by Industry or Sector :: Education", "shortname": "education", "fullname": "Education", "id": 360}], "translation": [], "os": [{"fullpath": "Operating System :: Emulation and API Compatibility :: Cygwin (MS Windows)", "shortname": "cygwin", "fullname": "Cygwin (MS Windows)", "id": 427}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Linux", "shortname": "linux", "fullname": "Linux", "id": 201}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 7", "shortname": "win7", "fullname": "Windows 7", "id": 851}, {"fullpath": "Operating System :: Modern (Vendor-Supported) Desktop Operating Systems :: Windows 8", "shortname": "windows_8", "fullname": "Windows 8", "id": 906}]}}
